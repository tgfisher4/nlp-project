WASHINGTON --  Robinson Chirinos and the scuffling Texas Rangers put the latest hurt on the Washington Nationals' wobbling bullpen.	The below-.500 Rangers rallied and beat the NL East leaders for the second straight game, with Robinson Chirinos hitting a three-run homer in the 11th inning for a 6-3 victory Saturday.	"It was an amazing win for us," Chirinos said. "It's really good. It tells you a lot about the guys to not give up."	Chirinos nearly put Texas ahead during the two-run, ninth-inning rally off closer Koda Glover that tied the game at 3. His bid for a tiebreaking sacrifice fly, however, was thwarted by Washington right fielder Bryce Harper, who made a strong throw to nail a runner at the plate.	Glover's second blown save was the 10th for Washington this season. He was pulled after Chirinos' flyball.	After exiting the game, Glover -- who was on the disabled list earlier this season with a left hit impingement -- told manager Dusty Baker he was dealing with "nagging" back pain all day.	"(Glover) admitted he should have told me or us before the game, you know, he said his back was really locked up, we didn't know it," Baker said.	Washington almost won in the bottom of the ninth. With two outs, Trea Turner bunted with a man at third, but pinch-runner Wilmer Difo hesitated going home and was quickly tagged out.	In the 11th, pinch-hitter Joey Gallo doubled with two outs off Shawn Kelley (3-2). Following an intentional walk to Nomar Mazara, Chirinos drove a fastball just over the left-field wall.	Keone Kela (3-1) went two innings to earn the win.	Shin-Soo Choo's leadoff homer in the ninth pulled Texas within a run, and Mazara's RBI double off Glover tied it. Pinch-runner Pete Kozma later tried to score on Chirinos' fly, but was out after a replay review reversed the original call.	"That's one thing about these guys. They don't get deflated," Rangers manager Jeff Banister said. "They don't give up at all. They stay in the fight."	First baseman Ryan Zimmerman did not play due to back pain. The NL batting leader with a .365 average is day-to-day.	His replacement, Adam Lind, homered during a three-run sixth inning that began with Harper's double. Harper went 1 for 4 with a walk while batting second in the lineup after hitting third in each of his previous 52 games this season.	Nationals starter Gio Gonzalez struck out nine in six innings, giving up one run and three hits.	Texas starter Martin Perez blanked the Nationals until they struck in the sixth.	Elvis Andrus had two hits, extending his hitting streak to 14 games, the longest active streak in the majors. Delino DeShields also had two hits and two of the Rangers' five stolen bases.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: 3B Adrian Beltre (ankle) finished 1 for 3 with a walk and stolen base in his return to the Rangers lineup. ... RHP Tyson Ross (Thoracic Outlet Syndrome surgery) allowed eight runs and 10 hits over five innings in his fourth rehab start for Triple-A Friday night. He will join the Rangers for their next series in Houston and discuss a plan with the organization, Banister said.	Nationals: Zimmerman said he injured his back diving for a ball in Tuesday's game at the Los Angeles Dodgers. He played two of the next three games. "It's one of those things where if you continue to play and it gets worse, something bad could happen. If you give it a day or two you can kind of just stop it right there," said Zimmerman, who expects to play Sunday or Monday.	UP NEXT	Rangers: RHP Austin Bibens-Dirkx (1-0, 4.08) will make his second start and seventh appearance of the season.	Nationals: RHP Max Scherzer (7-3, 2.35) is 3-0 with a 0.73 ERA and 38 strikeouts over his last three starts.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

ATLANTA --  Yoenis Cespedes isn't concerned that he can't run at 100 percent. He still swings a big bat.	Cespedes made a smashing return from a six-week stint on the disabled list on Saturday, hitting a grand slam as the New York Mets beat the Atlanta Braves 6-1 in the first game of a doubleheader.	"I wouldn't go out there to play if I knew that I could injure myself," he said through a translator. "That's why I went out there."	Cespedes, back from a strained left hamstring, didn't need to run fast after connecting against Luke Jackson in the ninth inning.	The slugging outfielder sent a drive over the left-center field wall and was able to trot slowly enough to soak in the moment and smile at his cheering teammates. He went 2 for 5, including his seventh home run of the season.	"It's not easy for any ballplayer to miss that much time and still have your timing down," Cespedes said. "But in my case, I've been playing for lots of years. So I just try to stay calm and look for good pitches."	Mets manager Terry Collins said the team plans to get Cespedes' input on how much he plays during the next week.	"Right now he's going to play a game, he's going to be off a day, then he's probably going to play a couple (of games), then get another day off," Collins said. "We'll wean him back into this thing."	Robert Gsellman (5-3) won his third straight start. He gave up three hits, two walks and struck out four in 6 2/3 scoreless innings.	The Braves had won three in a row.	Brandon Phillips' fourth homer for Atlanta cut the lead to 2-1 in the eighth off Fernando Salas, but closer Addison Reed got five outs for his 10th save.	Braves starter Sean Newcomb (0-1) lost in his major league debut despite allowing just one unearned run and four hits in 6 1/3 innings. He struck out seven and walked two while doing his best to block out any nerves early on.	T.J. Rivera and Wilmer Flores each had a sacrifice fly for the Mets, who avoided dropping to a season-worst nine games under .500. New York had lost 10 of its last 14 road games.	The Mets went up 2-0 in the eighth. Jackson hit Michael Conforto on the uniform with a pitch, Cespedes singled and a passed ball advanced the runners. Conforto scored on Flores' sacrifice fly.	New York took a 1-0 lead in the second, helped by Newcomb's throwing error on a potential double-play ball.	STRUGGLES CONTINUE	Mets SS Asdrubal Cabrera committed two errors in the first, giving him 10 for the season. He had only seven in 135 games last year. ... Jose Reyes went 0 for 4 as his average dropped four points to .186. Reyes is hitless in his last 26 at-bats.	UP NEXT	Mets: LHP Steven Matz (0-0) will be activated from the disabled list to start the second game of the split doubleheader and make his season debut. Matz has been sidelined with left elbow inflammation. He's 3-0 with a 3.38 ERA in five career starts against Atlanta.	Braves: RHP Matt Wisler (0-0) will make his first start of the season. He has a 7.00 ERA in nine innings of relief this year. Wisler went 7-13 with a 5.03 ERA in 26 starts last season.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  The game was already long and there would be another one. Evan Longoria wanted to get it over.	"We didn't need more extra innings in a game like today," Longoria said after his RBI single in the 10th inning lifted the Tampa Bay Rays over the Oakland Athletics 6-5 Saturday. "It's been quite a while since I've gotten a walk-off hit. It felt good."	The Rays' fourth straight win came in the opener of the majors' first regularly scheduled doubleheader since 2011.	Oakland, which scored a run in the ninth to tie it, lost despite getting a season-high 16 hits.	Peter Bourjos led off the 10th with a single, advanced on a wild pitch by Liam Hendriks (2-1) and scored on Longoria's third hit of the game.	It was Longoria's eighth career walkoff hit, but his first since a two-run homer against San Diego on May 11, 2013.	"He's gotten tons of hits in his career," manager Kevin Cash said. "That was one we needed, and I think he probably needed, too. He's been spinning a little bit, showing a little bit of frustration."	Austin Pruitt (5-1) won in relief.	Oakland starter Sonny Gray struck out 10 while giving up five runs, only two of them earned, in six innings.	Steven Souza Jr. and Tim Beckham each drove in two runs for the Rays.	The A's led off the third with five straight hits off Erasmo Ramirez to take a 3-0 lead. Jed Lowrie drove in the first run with a double and Khris Davis and Yonder Alonso followed with RBI singles.	They had a chance to build the lead in the fourth when they loaded the bases with none out and came up empty.	"We had a chance to blow the game open," Oakland manager Bob Melvin said. "We left a lot (13) on base. Earlier in the game we had a lot better chance to win because we put together some at bats."	Souza hit a two-run single in the fourth and Beckham put the Rays ahead 4-3 with a two-out, two-run double in the sixth.	The Rays added another run in the sixth when catcher Josh Phegley mishandled a throw enabling Beckham to score from second base on Michael Martinez's infield single. It was Oakland's second error of the game and major league-worst 61st of the season.	Ryon Healy hit an RBI single in the A's seventh. Back-to-back doubles by Alonso and Healy off Alex Colome tied it at 5 in the ninth.	A's center fielder Jaycob Brugman got his first major league hit, a sixth-inning single off Ramirez.	DOUBLE DIP	The last regularly scheduled doubleheader in the majors was on July 11, 2011, when the A's hosted the Angels. This was the second doubleheader at Tropicana Field -- the other was Sept. 30, 2004, when two games against the Detroit Tigers had to be rescheduled because of Hurricane Frances.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: RHP Andrew Triggs was put on the disabled list with a strained left hip after giving up eight runs in 3 2/3 innings Friday night. OF Matt Olson was recalled from Nashville to take Triggs' roster spot.	Rays: RHP Matt Andriese (strained groin) was activated to pitch the second game. His last start was May 30. ... C Wilson Ramos (recovery from torn ACL) may soon have his rehab upgraded from Class A Charlotte to Triple-A Durham.	UP NEXT	RHP Jesse Hahn (2-4) will pitch the series finale for Oakland on Sunday against Tampa Bay RHP Chris Archer (4-4).	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ST. LOUIS --  Carlos Martinez has been waiting for this moment.	The St. Louis Cardinals' ace right-hander struck out 11 and beat the Philadelphia Phillies 7-0 on Saturday, the first shutout and first complete game of his career.	"All I can really say is I'm living out my dream," Martinez said through an interpreter. "This was one of my goals, one of my dreams. The next one is to pitch a perfect game. And I just feel so happy with my performance. I was completely focused today. All of my pitches were perfect, in my opinion. The location, they were perfect. I'm just really happy."	Jedd Gyorko drove in three runs for the Cardinals, who have won two straight against the Phillies after their seven-game skid on their recent trip.	"I think it kind of gets everyone feeling good," Cardinals catcher Eric Fryer said. "Obviously the road trip was a rough one. Coming here, getting the win, breaking the streak, was obviously what we wanted to accomplish. Then coming out here and Carlos putting his foot down and just saying let's get going, it's pretty nice."	Martinez (5-5) allowed four hits and walked one. Martinez's 101st pitch of the game was a 100 mph fastball that struck out Howie Kendrick for the second out in the ninth.	The young righty has turned in some impressive performances in his four-year career -- including tossing nine shutout innings in a 13-inning game last month -- but Saturday's start may go down as the best of them.	"I think he would tell you it was his best," Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said. "I don't think we could disagree. What more would you want? He had the strikeouts when he wanted them. He pitched to contact at other times. He had the live fastball and wanted to show it off late because he still had it. Just did a little bit of everything. I thought he had a real nice rhythm too."	"He threw all his pitches for strikes and changed speeds and had that velocity late in the game," Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said.	Martinez survived a scare in the seventh inning when he was hit by a pitch on his pitching hand from Phillies reliever Jeanmar Gomez. He was down on the ground briefly but got up and stayed in the game. He later scored from third base on a sacrifice fly by Gyorko.	"Thank God it wasn't anything major," Martinez said. "I saw the ball. I thought it was coming right to my face. That's why I reacted so quickly and moved out of the way. It only got my hand and nothing major."	The Cardinals gave Martinez all the run support he would need with a four-run fourth, which tied their season high for runs in an inning, and then three runs in the seventh.	Gyorko opened the scoring with a two-run double off the wall in right-center, after a leadoff walk by Dexter Fowler and a double by Stephen Piscotty. Gyorko scored on a balk by Nick Pivetta. Fryer made it 4-0 with an RBI single.	Pivetta (1-3), making his sixth career start, allowed four runs and four hits in five innings, with four walks and two strikeouts.	St. Louis added three runs in the seventh on Matt Carpenter's two-run double and Gyorko's sacrifice fly. The Cardinals finished with six hits.	GETTING PICKY	Pivetta, the Phillies' starter, picked off Fowler and Tommy Pham to end the first and second innings.	BALK THIS WAY	Pivetta's fourth-inning balk was the Phillies' seventh of the season. The seven balks have come from seven pitchers.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: 2B Cesar Hernandez was not in the lineup Saturday after experiencing tightness in his side during Friday's game.	Cardinals: C Yadier Molina was scratched from the lineup for the second straight game with lower back stiffness.	UP NEXT	Phillies: RHP Aaron Nola (3-3, 4.28) tossed seven shutout innings, allowing just two hits, in his only previous start against the Cardinals.	Cardinals: RHP Adam Wainwright (6-4, 4.82) is 6-2 with a 2.85 ERA in 15 appearances (13 starts) against the Phillies. He is 3-0 with a 0.47 ERA in three day game starts this season.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.

CHICAGO --  The Colorado Rockies arrived at Wrigley Field this week with a chance to solidify their standing as a National League contender, and they haven't missed a beat.	Of course, these Chicago Cubs look a long way from their World Series-winning form.	Mark Reynolds and Charlie Blackmon homered, rookie Jeff Hoffman pitched neatly into the seventh inning and the Rockies won their seventh straight game, beating the Cubs 9-1 Saturday. Colorado can complete a four-game sweep of the reigning champs Sunday behind breakout rookie right-hander Antonio Senzatela.	"These guys are growing before our eyes, and it's great stuff and good to see," manager Bud Black said. "Charlie's having a big series. Mark had a big day today. A lot of contributors today."	The Rockies have their longest winning streak since 2011, when they started a run of six straight losing seasons. The Cubs lost their fourth in a row, dropping them to 30-31.	Reynolds had his fourth career four-hit game, including his 17th homer, and Nolan Arenado had a three-run double during a five-run ninth inning. The Rockies, who have the best record in the NL, improved to 24-10 on the road.	One of four rookies in the Rockies' rotation, the 24-year-old Hoffman (4-0) allowed one run and struck out eight in 6 1/3 innings. Four Colorado relievers kept Chicago scoreless the rest of the way.	"It was awesome," Hoffman said of his first start at Wrigley Field. "Facing a great lineup and to be able to go out there and do what I did and execute -- and the team to play the way it did -- was special."	Cubs starter Eddie Butler (3-2) pitched five innings and gave up three runs and six hits in his first outing against his former team. Willson Contreras drove in the only run for Chicago, now sliding after a five-game winning streak.	"We just have to do a better job at the plate," manager Joe Maddon said. "I don't have any strong explanation for it, but a lot of guys are struggling badly at the same time."	Reigning MVP Kris Bryant joined the Cubs in 2015 and isn't used to losing.	"This is probably, I guess, the lowest point that I've been at here," Bryant said. "But it's really not bad when you look at in context of the division."	Chicago entered the day two games behind Milwaukee in the NL Central.	Hoffman dominated in his fourth start and third straight solid outing. The right-hander was one of four players the Rockies acquired from Toronto in a July 2015 trade that sent All-Star shortstop Troy Tulowitzki to the Blue Jays.	Anthony Rizzo, the third Chicago batter in the first, blooped a single to left, then Hoffman didn't permit another hit until Jason Heyward's lined single with one out in the seventh. Albert Almora Jr. and Contreras then followed with singles for the Cubs' only run.	"We didn't hit any balls hard basically until that inning when we did string together some singles," Maddon said.	The Rockies took a 2-0 lead in the first when DJ LeMahieu and Reynolds each doubled home a run.	Reynolds homered over the left field stands onto Waveland Avenue, making it 3-0 in the fourth. Blackmon hit his 15th homer over the right field bleachers in the seventh.	RUSSELL RETURNS	Addison Russell returned to Cubs lineup, two days after Major League Baseball began an investigation of the All-Star shortstop in the wake of domestic violence allegations in a deleted social media post. The Cubs told Russell not to come to the ballpark Thursday for a game against the Rockies, but he rejoined the team on Friday and didn't play. Russell, who entered the game hitting .209, went 0 for 2 before being lifted for a pinch hitter in the seventh.	QUICK TRIP	The Cubs recalled RHP Felix Pena from Triple-A Iowa and optioned righty Seth Frankoff to the farm club. Frankoff made his major league debut on Friday -- and took the loss against the Rockies -- after being recalled to fill a roster spot for righty Kyle Hendricks, who's on the DL (right had tendinitis).	UP NEXT	Senzatela (8-2, 3.56) will make his first career start at Wrigley Field and try to become the NL's first nine-game winner on Sunday afternoon in the finale of the four-game series. The Cubs will counter with RHP Jake Arrieta (6-4, 4.46).	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PITTSBURGH --  The Pirates spent most of Saturday looking for a big hit to break through against the Miami Marlins.	They finally got it in the seventh, when Jordy Mercer hit a tying two-run triple and John Jaso followed with a go-ahead double, lifting Pittsburgh to a 7-6 victory.	Mercer's shot to center off reliever David Phelps (2-3) scored Andrew McCutchen and Elias Diaz, then Mercer scored on Jaso's ground-rule double to right.	"Mercer and those guys who got on base in the seventh, they did all the heavy lifting, really," Jaso said of his big pinch hit. "My job was probably the easiest out of all of those guys."	After ceding three runs in the first, Pittsburgh left runners in scoring position in five consecutive innings before Mercer and Jaso finally came through, frustrating what was otherwise a solid offensive performance.	The Pirates totaled 16 hits, with Josh Bell, Diaz and McCutchen collecting three apiece.	"We made pitching hard for them today," manager Clint Hurdle said. "I liked the fight in the offense. I liked the fight all over the place"	Marlins star Giancarlo Stanton was hit by a pitch on the right wrist in the first inning and left the game. The team said X-rays were negative and that Stanton is day-to-day with a bruised wrist.	"The fact that there's no fractures just means basically there's going to be some swelling," Marlins manager Don Mattingly said. "It's going to be sore. How long's that going to be? It could be a few days."	Even without Stanton, the Marlins kept slugging, tagging Pirates starter Trevor Williams with up five runs in four innings, including back-to-back homers by J.T. Realmuto and Derek Dietrich in the fourth. Realmuto had three hits and three RBI.	Daniel Hudson (1-2) earned the win behind a scoreless seventh. Juan Nicasio got two outs in the eighth, and Felipe Rivero got four outs for the save -- his first with the Pirates and the fourth of his career.	SHUFFLING THE DECK	The Pirates made five transactions before the game, sending RHPs Tyler Glasnow and Dovydas Neverauskas to Triple-A Indianapolis, recalling RHPs Edgar Santana and A.J. Schugel and designating RHP Pat Light for assignment.	Glasnow had been in the Pirates' rotation all season, but was 2-6 with a 7.45 ERA. He'll be replaced by Jameson Taillon, returning from surgery to treat testicular cancer on May 8. Santana and Schugel joined the bullpen, which has had a busy week. Pirates relievers have thrown 215 2/3 innings this season, tied for fourth-most in the National League.	The Marlins also exchanged relievers, sending Brian Ellington to Triple-A New Orleans and recalling Drew Steckenrider. Mattingly said he'd like Ellington to focus on throwing more strikes and likes Steckenrider's ability to go multiple innings.	BIG WELCOME	Santana made his major league debut in the sixth inning. The first batter he faced was a man with over 3,000 hits to his name in Miami's Ichiro Suzuki.	"I was an honor to face that kind of hitter," Santana said. "Before my first pitch, I was a little scared. I was like, `Oh my God. It's Ichiro.' After the first pitch, I said to myself, `I got this. I can make outs."	Santana got Ichiro to ground out and gave up a run on two hits in his inning of work.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: RHP Junichi Tazawa threw at two-inning rehab appearance with Class A Jupiter on Friday night. Tazawa gave up one hit and struck out two. It was his first rehab stint as he returns from rib cartilage inflammation. He has been out since May 16.	Pirates: Taillon is expected to make his return from the disabled list on Monday and start that night against the Colorado Rockies. Taillon has not pitched since May 4.	UP NEXT	Marlins: Jeff Locke (0-1, 3.48 ERA) will make his first start against the Pirates, the only major league team he'd ever played for before his season.	Pirates: Ivan Nova (5-4, 3.06 ERA) will take his regular turn five days after leaving the game in Baltimore on Tuesday with left knee inflammation. Nova said his knee feels "fine" and shouldn't be an issue.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Rookie Jose Berrios faced a bases-loaded jam after a pair of walks in the third inning with a couple of proven, veteran hitters due up for San Francisco.	The Puerto Rican right-hander calmly struck out Brandon Crawford, then retired Hunter Pence on a called third strike -- and he was on his way to another stellar outing in Minnesota's 3-2 victory against the Giants on Saturday.	"I found it to be an interesting scenario. I just concentrated on making better pitches, and pitches with better quality," Berrios said through a translator. "That's how I survived and the more I can get on it, the more comfortable I get and the more confidence I'll have."	Brian Dozier and Kennys Vargas hit home runs to back Berrios (5-1), who struck out eight over 5 1/3 innings to win his second straight start, both on this road trip. He allowed a first-inning home run to Brandon Belt.	Bruce Bochy is baffled by San Francisco's offensive struggles, yet the manager still believes he has enough talented hitters to break out of this funk.	Minnesota shut down Bochy's lineup for a second straight day, and it's the same story of missed opportunities for the Giants.	Crawford and Pence, two key Giants hitters, each struck out three times.	"It's obvious they're not seeing the ball very well, either one," Bochy said. "That makes it tough when you're in the heart of the order and we have a couple of guys really struggling. That makes it tough to score runs. Those are the guys that you lean on."	Belt splashed a 3-2 pitch into McCovey Cove for a solo homer in the first inning to put San Francisco ahead. It marked his seventh career homer into the bay beyond the right field wall named for Hall of Famer Willie McCovey and second this season.	Berrios allowed six hits, two earned runs and three walks in his first career appearance against San Francisco. Brandon Kintzler, the Twins' third reliever, finished with a 1-2-3 ninth for his 17th save in 18 chances.	Giants starter Jeff Samardzija (2-8) struck out six and walked one over six innings, increasing his impressive totals to 65 Ks and two walks in his last eight starts.	But he also has given up six home runs during that stretch. Vargas led off the fourth with his second of the year, and Dozier hit a go-ahead, two-run drive in the fifth.	"Although you like how you feel out there and are OK with the results, you'd like to keep definitely that Dozier ball in the park," Samardzija said.	Samardzija beat the Brewers his last time out to end a two-start skid but still hasn't won consecutive outings this season. He had been 4-0 with a 3.67 ERA in his previous five matchups with Minnesota.	Buster Posey doubled and drove in a run on a groundout for San Francisco, shut out 4-0 a night earlier.	Belt's drive to the water was the 73rd by the Giants and matched Pablo Sandoval for second behind 35 hit by home run king Barry Bonds. There have been 113 overall at AT&T Park.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Twins: After the game, LHP Randy Rosario was optioned to Double-A Chattanooga. ... 1B Joe Mauer had much of the day off before entering in the sixth. ... Chris Gimenez caught Berrios as Jason Castro rested.	Giants: LHP Madison Bumgarner, who bruised his ribs and sprained his pitching shoulder in an April 20 dirt bike accident in Colorado, could face live hitters at some point during a four-game series in Denver beginning Thursday. ... 2B Joe Panik was held out of the lineup and isn't likely to play again until the Giants open a two-game series against Kansas City on Tuesday. Panik injured his left thumb trying to dive for a ball up the middle Thursday. ... Mike Morse is still feeling effects from a concussion he suffered in a collision with Samardzija while both were trying to break up a benches-clearing brawl against the Washington Nationals on May 29. Morse did some cardio work Friday but was "foggy" afterward, Bochy said.	GIMENEZ RUNS	The 230-pound Gimenez stole second in the fifth for his fourth career swipe in nine years and first since Aug. 4, 2015, while with Texas and against Houston -- with current teammate Castro behind the plate for the Astros.	"I've been waiting a long time to do this," Gimenez said. "They told me before the series I could steal if it's the right situation. I got pretty excited."	UP NEXT	Left-hander Nik Turley makes his long-awaited major league debut against his former franchise and opposite Giants righty Matt Cain (3-5), who has never faced the Twins or the Rays -- the only clubs he is yet to pitch against during his career.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

HOUSTON --  The Houston Astros needed someone to step up and help Lance McCullers stabilize their rotation with starters Dallas Keuchel, Charlie Morton and Joe Musgrove all on the disabled list.	That player has been Mike Fiers, who has shaken off a tough start to the season with three straight solid outings capped by Saturday's performance in a 3-1 win against the Los Angeles Angels.	Fiers (4-2) allowed a season-low two hits and one run, which was unearned, in a season-high 7 1/3 innings, to get his third straight win after managing just one win in his first nine starts.	"This is the best stuff I think he's brought into the game this season and I think it was a combination of everything but everything seemed to be working off his change up," manager A.J. Hinch said. "He could throw it any count, he threw some nasty ones that looked like split-fingers."	He struck out eight in his longest start since throwing a no-hitter against the Los Angeles Dodgers on August 21, 2015.	Fiers explained what he thinks has led to his recent success.	"Just command and throwing my curveball like I used to," he said. "You guys got some false advertisement early this year. But this is how I pitch and this is the pitcher I am. I'm just going to continue that for the rest of this year. There's mistakes you make early on and the quicker you fix them the better off you are."	Fiers, who was plagued by home runs as he struggled through his first nine starts, hasn't allowed any during his three-game winning streak.	"He didn't do anything that we haven't seen before, but he was doing it well," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "He changed speeds, had a good breaking ball and change up going as well."	Ken Giles walked one and struck out three in a scoreless ninth for his 16th save .	Brian McCann put Houston up 1-0 with his solo shot to right field off Ricky Nolasco (2-7) with one out in the second.	Nolasco plunked McCann to start Houston's fifth before Marwin Gonzalez singled on the 10th pitch of his at-bat to send McCann to third. The Astros pushed the lead to 2-0 on a sacrifice fly by Yuli Gurriel.	Nolasco tied a season-high by yielding eight hits with two runs in seven innings to extend his losing streak to five games, which ties a career high. The home run to McCann moved him ahead of Fiers for most homers allowed in the American League this season with 19.	Fiers didn't allow a hit until a single by Albert Pujols with two outs in the fourth inning. He walked Martin Maldonado with one out in the fifth and hit Eric Young Jr. with a pitch with two outs. But the Angels didn't have another baserunner until Ben Revere reached on an error by Carlos Correa to start the eighth.	Pinch-hitter Luis Valbuena singled with one out to chase Fiers, who was replaced by Chris Devenski. Revere and pinch-runner Danny Espinosa then pulled off a double steal before the Angels got within 1 when Revere scored on a groundout by Andrelton Simmons. But Devenski struck out Kole Calhoun to limit the damage.	Carlos Correa provided an insurance run with an RBI single with one out in the eighth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: OF Cameron Maybin was out of the lineup a day after tying a franchise record with a career-high four steals on Friday night in his first game back from the disabled list. But Maybin said he was fine and the day off was planned before his return on Friday night.	Astros: Keuchel won't begin throwing again for about a week as he recovers from neck discomfort that has landed him on the disabled list for the second time this season. Keuchel was scratched from his start on Wednesday at Kansas City and placed on the 10-day disabled list a day later, a move retroactive to June 5. It's the same problem that put him on the disabled list earlier and caused him to miss one start. He isn't sure when he'll return, but expects to miss at least two more starts.	HOMERS, HOMERS AND MORE HOMERS	That hit gave the Astros at least one homer in 18 straight games, which ties a franchise record set in 2000. Houston, which leads the majors with 96 homers, has hit 35 during this streak.	UP NEXT	Angels: Jesse Chavez (5-6, 4.56 ERA) will start for Los Angeles in the finale on Sunday. Chavez allowed seven hits and two runs in 5 2/3 innings for the win in his last start.	Astros: David Paulino (0-0, 4.66) is scheduled to make his third start of the season on Sunday for Houston. He yielded eight hits and three runs in 5 2/3 innings but not factor in the decision in his last start on Tuesday.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

SAN DIEGO --  Kansas City Royals stars Eric Hosmer and Salvador Perez would welcome more games in San Diego, even though Petco Park is a spacious place for sluggers.	Hosmer and Perez hit home runs as part of a nine-run eighth inning that also included Lorenzo Cain's grand slam, sending the Royals to a 12-6 victory Saturday over the San Diego Padres.	Cain homered twice, and Alcides Escobar hit his first home run of the year as the Royals hit five home runs for the first time since July 23, 2003, at Minnesota.	At the All-Star Game last year in San Diego, Hosmer and Perez homered in the first inning. Hosmer took away the game's MVP award.	Hosmer homered in his return to Petco in March for the World Baseball Classic and struck again Saturday with a two-run, tying shot off San Diego's best reliever, Brad Hand (1-4).	"I've had some great moments here," Hosmer said. "Don't know what the cause of that is, but I definitely enjoy it when this San Diego trip is on the schedule."	Hosmer said Cain set him up against Hand by opening the eighth with a single off the lefty.	At the time, the Royals trailed 5-3.	Hosmer, the next hitter, said he sought a fastball from Hand because "he's really pitched off that slider all year well."	With the speedy Cain on first base, the lefty Hosmer hit a 1-0 fastball over the left-field wall.	The ball landed in the seats near where he drove the All-Star Game home run, off former Royals teammate Johnny Cueto.	"That's the benefit of hitting behind `Lo' Cain," Hosmer said. "Any time he gets on first, he's a baserunning threat to steal as well. So after the first slider, I knew there was a good chance I might get a fastball. It might be the only one I got, so I just wanted to make sure I was on time and not miss it."	Perez followed with a home run, the 100th of his career. Noting the wear and tear a catcher takes, Hosmer called the total "really impressive."	Counting the 2016 All-Star Game, Perez has homered in his past three games at Petco.	Cain capped Kansas City's highest-scoring inning since a 10-run first against the Cleveland Indians on Aug. 23, 2006, hitting his slam off a 97-mph fastball from Jose Valdez.	"Two-seamer, inside," Cain said. "I pulled my hands inside and the ball ended up getting out for me. It was huge."	The grand slam was Kanas City's first this season and Cain's second of his career. Cain also hit a solo shot in the sixth, and has six home runs this season.	Travis Wood (1-2) won in relief.	Royals starter Ian Kennedy gave up a leadoff homer to Jose Pirela and allowed four runs in six innings. Kennedy is winless in 15 starts dating to last Sept. 11.	Pirela bounced a two-run double over third baseman Mike Moustakas during a three-run fifth that made it 4-1.	Miguel Diaz made his first major league start after 21 relief appearances. The rookie didn't get an out in the third inning, leaving with the bases loaded and none out.	Padres manager Andy Green said Diaz "was probably a little bit over-amped, starting for the first time, not throttling himself a little bit so he could get a little bit deeper into the ballgame."	Reliever Craig Stammen bailed him out, striking out Jorge Bonifacio and getting a double-play grounder from Cain that kept the Padres ahead 1-0.	Escobar's drive, off Stammen, made it 1-all in the fifth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: 1B Wil Myers was scratched from the lineup because of illness. His replacement at first, Pirela, who was in the original lineup at third base, had a throwing error in the first inning.	UP NEXT	Royals: RHP Jakob Junis (1-0, 7.84) is coming off a no-decision against Houston in which he allowed seven runs (four earned) in 3 2/3 innings.	Padres: RHP Dinelson Lamet (2-0, 6.92) is limiting right-handers to a .176 batting average, while lefties are hitting .286 against him.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

ATLANTA --  Steven Matz and Yoenis Cespedes returned on the same day to give the New York Mets a big boost.	The Mets have a long way to climb up in the standings. They're 10 1/2 games out of the NL East lead and six games under .500, but with 102 games remaining on the schedule, there's plenty of time to turn the season around.	"We have a lot left," manager Terry Collins said. "Now we have to make sure we work very, very hard to make sure Steven Matz goes out there every five or six days and Yoenis Cespedes finishes the season healthy."	Matz pitched seven impressive innings in his season debut, Jay Bruce hit a three-run homer and New York beat the Braves 8-1 Saturday night to sweep a doubleheader.	Cespedes made a smashing return in the first game, hitting a grand slam to celebrate his return to the lineup following a six-week stint on the disabled list. The Mets won the opener 6-1.	Matz (1-0), appearing in a big league game for first time since last Aug. 14, gave up five hits, one run and one walk. The left-hander struck out two, holding the Braves scoreless until the seventh.	Matz had a bone spur surgically removed from his left elbow last October and began the season on the disabled list with elbow inflammation. The oft-injured former phenom hardly looked rusty, cruising through the first five innings before escaping trouble in the sixth when Matt Kemp flied out with two runners on.	"I was able to locate the fastball away today," Matz said. "I didn't really have my greatest, sharpest stuff today, but I feel like I was able to execute pitches when I did and the defense behind me was playing great."	Wilmer Flores got four hits, and went a combined 6 for 9 in the two games.	New York, which didn't trail all day, went up 3-0 in the fifth on Bruce's 16th homer. Pinch-hitter T.J. Rivera had a two-run homer in the eighth and pinch-hitter Juan Lagares added a two-run single in the ninth.	The Braves have lost 15 of 20 games to the Mets in Atlanta.	"We couldn't get anything going offensively either game," Braves manager Brian Snitker said. "We'll put that behind us, come out tomorrow and push the series."	Matt Wilser (0-1) gave up six hits, four runs and three walks in six innings. He struck out seven in making his first start of the season.	Cespedes, back from a strained left hamstring, said he still can't run at 100 percent, but he didn't need to run fast after connecting against Luke Jackson in the ninth inning of the first game.	The slugging outfielder sent a drive over the left-center field wall and was able to trot slowly enough to soak in the moment and smile at his cheering teammates. He went 2 for 5, including his seventh home run of the season.	Robert Gsellman (5-3) won his third straight start. He gave up three hits, two walks and struck out four in 6 2/3 scoreless innings.	Sean Newcomb (0-1) lost in his major league debut despite allowing just one unearned run and four hits in 6 1/3 innings. He struck out seven and walked two.	STRUGGLING AND STREAKING	Flores raised his batting average 23 points to .333. ... Mets SS Asdrubal Cabrera committed two errors in the first game, giving him 10 for the season. He had only seven in 135 games last year. Cabrera didn't play in the second game. ... Jose Reyes singled in the fifth inning of the second game to snap a 0-for-28 skid. ... Kemp, who went 0 for 5 on the day, was ejected by plate umpire Phil Cuzzi after grounding out to end the eighth. It was Kemp's first ejection this year and the 14th of his career.	METS MOVES	INF Matt Reynolds, Rivera and RHP Tyler Pill have been optioned to Triple-A Las Vegas to make room for Matz, Cespedes and RHP Seth Lugo on the roster. ... In the midst of 18 games in 17 days, manager Terry Collins said the team will go temporarily with a six-man rotation after RHP Matt Harvey starts Wednesday. Collins wants to ease Matz and Lugo back into the rotation.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: Collins said the team plans to get Cespedes' input on how much he plays over the next week or so. Cespedes, who didn't play in the second game, will take a wait and see attitude depending on how his body feels. "For the moment, yes," Cespedes said through a translator. "Starting next week, we'll see if I feel 100 percent. At that point, I'm not taking days off."... 2B Neil Walker was back in the lineup in the nightcap after not starting the last three games because of an injured left knee.	UP NEXT	Mets: Lugo (0-0) makes his season debut Sunday and his second career start against Atlanta. He's been on the disabled list since the beginning of the season with right elbow inflammation.	Braves: LHP Jaime Garcia (2-4) will make his 12th start of the season. Garcia has a 3.21 ERA in 70 innings. In eight career starts against the Mets, Garcia is 2-4 with a 3.06 ERA.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  The Oakland Athletics had two of their best offensive games this season. Still, they might have lost both without another strong start by Sean Manaea.	Manaea won his fifth consecutive start to help the Athletics split a rare scheduled doubleheader with a 7-2 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays on Saturday night.	"Going on a streak like this is nice, and I've just got to keep it going and try to be consistent with how I go about my routine," Manaea said.	Tampa Bay won the opener 6-5 on Evan Longoria's RBI single in the 10th inning that completed a 3-hour, 56-minute game. Game 2 took 3:06.	"It's a long day," Rays manager Kevin Cash said. "Sweeping a doubleheader in this league is really difficult to do."	The split came in the majors' first scheduled doubleheader since 2011.	After getting a season-high 16 hits in the opener, Oakland got 16 again during Game 2.	Manaea (6-3) allowed two runs and six hits over seven innings. He was supported by home runs from Josh Phegley, Ryon Healy and Chad Pinder.	Longoria got his eighth career game-ending hit, but his first since a two-run homer against San Diego on May 11, 2013.	"We didn't need more extra innings in a game like that today," Longoria said. "It's been quite a while since I've gotten a walk-off hit. It felt good."	Longoria had two RBI in the second game, coming on a first-inning RBI single and his 250th career homer in the sixth.	"Evan's not anywhere close to stopping," Cash said.	Yonder Alonso had four hits for Oakland in the nightcap and seven over the doubleheader.	"That's a month's worth of hits for some people," Oakland manager Bob Melvin said.	Austin Pruitt (5-1) won in relief and Liam Hendriks (2-1) took the loss in the opener.	Oakland Game 1 starter Sonny Gray struck out 10 while giving up five runs, only two of them earned, in six innings.	Rays Game 2 starter Matt Andriese lasted one inning before departing with a groin strain, the same injury that put him on the 10-day disabled list May 31.	Andriese will have an MRI on Sunday and expects to go back on the DL.	"Very frustrating," he said.	Chih-Wei Hu (0-1) replaced Andriese and gave up one run -- Phegley's shot in the second -- over four innings.	Healy had a solo drive and Pinder hit a two-run shot off Ryne Stanek that made it 6-2 in the seventh.	DOUBLE DIP	The last regularly scheduled doubleheader in the majors was on July 11, 2011, when the A's hosted the Angels. This was the second doubleheader at Tropicana Field -- the other was Sept. 30, 2004, when two games against the Detroit Tigers had to be rescheduled because of Hurricane Frances.	OLD DAYS	The Rays wore 1970s style uniforms in Game 1 as part of a "Turn Back the Clock" promotion. 1973 AL All-Star Bill "Spaceman" Lee threw the ceremonial first pitch while in full uniform, and an on-field banner parade took place between games. There was a video tribute to Adam West, TV's Batman, who died Friday night at 88.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: LHP Sean Doolittle returned from a left shoulder strain and had a perfect eighth in Game 2. ... RHP Andrew Triggs was put on the disabled list with a strained left hip after giving up eight runs in 3 2/3 innings Friday night.	Rays: C Wilson Ramos (torn ACL) may soon have his rehab upgraded from Class A Charlotte to Triple-A Durham.	UP NEXT	RHP Jesse Hahn (2-4) will pitch the series finale for Oakland on Sunday against Tampa Bay RHP Chris Archer (4-4).	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BOSTON -- Chris Sale finally knows what it feels like to get a win against the Detroit Tigers when he's facing their ace Justin Verlander.	Sale outlasted Verlander to win his seventh straight decision in a matchup of big-name pitchers, and the Boston Red Sox pulled away late to beat the Tigers 11-3 on Saturday night.	"That's a tough team over there," Sale said. "I've seen quite a bit of them. They've given me some fits over the years."	Coming into the marquee matchup, Sale had faced the Tigers five times with Verlander on the mound, and his team was winless in those games.	Mitch Moreland's tiebreaking, two-run double sparked a three-run seventh inning and Boston added five more in the eighth for its second straight late-inning win over the Tigers. The Red Sox have won 13 of 19.	Sale (8-2) pitched seven solid innings, giving up three runs on nine hits, striking out seven without issuing a walk.	Verlander was gone with high pitch count after five, allowing three runs and four walks with three strikeouts after leaving his previous start following two innings with a tight right groin. Detroit has lost four of five.	"All night long we did a very good job with long at-bats, staying with the strike zone and being relentless at the plate," Red Sox manager John Farrell said.	Verlander said the groin injury forced him to adjust a bit.	"I was cognizant of it, but it made it through about as good as I could have hoped for," he said. "I was just, like I said, aware of it and not trying to overdo anything."	Tigers manager Brad Ausmus knows how tough it is scoring against Sale.	"We've got a lot of guys who have seen him quite a bit," he said. "That certainly helps. We've had some success against him in the past. But, yeah, scoring three runs on Sale is not easy to do."	With runners on first and second, Moreland doubled off the Green Monster against Warwick Saupold (1-1). Josh Rutledge added an RBI single.	Andrew Benintendi had a two-run single in the eighth and finished with three RBI. Moreland also had an RBI single in a two-run third.	The Tigers had tied it 2-2 in the fifth, but the Red Sox regained the lead that inning on Benintendi's sacrifice fly.	Detroit retied it on Mikie Mahtook's RBI single an inning later.	Sale escaped a jam in the third with runners on the corners and no outs by striking out three straight, including slugger Miguel Cabrera looking with a 96-mph fastball on the inside corner.	Red Sox center fielder Jackie Bradley Jr. helped Sale out of trouble in the first with a diving catch of J.D. Martinez's sinking liner.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: C James McCann started his second straight after coming off the 10-day disabled list Friday. He had been sidelined with a cut on his left hand.	Red Sox: RHP Carson Smith, recovering from Tommy John surgery last season, threw 25 pitches off the mound before BP against batters that had mostly weak swings and grounders.	SPECIAL DONATION	Former Boston College baseball player Pete Frates, who was diagnosed with ALS in 2012 and started the Ice Bucket Challenge two years later that's helped raised over $100-million for research of the disease, donated his bucket and sunglasses he used in the original challenge along with his glove and BC hat to the National Baseball Hall of Fame on the field before the game.	Red Sox utility infielder Brock Holt and Farrell joined the presentation.	"For a difficult situation to be brought in such a positive way, hopefully to be able to raise funds to someday and one day find a cure and make a quality of life better, we champion what Pete has done," Farrell said.	NICE TOUCH	The theme song from the TV show "Batman" was played over the PA after the first inning. Adam West, the original Batman, died Saturday. He was 88.	UP NEXT	Tigers LHP Daniel Norris (2-4, 4.48 ERA) is set to start the nationally-televised series finale Sunday night against LHP Drew Pomeranz (6-3, 4.02), who looks to extend his career-best three-game winning streak.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CLEVELAND --  David Holmberg had gone two years between victories. The wait was worth it Saturday night.	Holmberg allowed two runs in five innings for his first win since July 30, 2015 and the Chicago White Sox defeated the Cleveland Indians 5-3.	The left-hander (1-0) hadn't won since defeating Pittsburgh when he was a member of the Cincinnati Reds.	"We need to win some ballgames, so I'm happy," Holmberg said. "You want to get in, use all your pitches, and get out. The guys came out hitting for me, so I wanted to do my part."	Holmberg began the season at Triple-A Charlotte and was called up on May 4.	Jose Abreu, who was forced to leave Friday's game after being hit on the left knee by a pitch from Andrew Miller, had an RBI single in a three-run first.	Manager Rick Renteria wasn't sure if his slugger would be able to play and made out two lineup cards. Abreu cleared that up when he arrived at the ballpark and told Renteria he wanted to be in the lineup. Abreu was 3 for 5, with a double in the second and a single in the fifth.	Chicago won despite having six runners thrown out on the bases. The White Sox had two runners thrown out in the first and one in the second, third, fifth and eighth innings. Melky Cabrera was thrown out at home in the first and again in the second.	"We were super aggressive but not necessarily good," Renteria said. "We were a little reckless. Some of the outs were aggressive, but we're going to try to score runs, so that's going to happen."	Josh Tomlin (3-8) allowed four runs -- three earned -- and nine hits in 2 2/3 innings as the Indians lost for the fifth time in seven games.	"The one person who didn't do his job was me," Tomlin said. "I went out there and gave up four runs early on and put us in a hole."	Edwin Encarnacion homered for the second straight day, a two-run shot in the fourth. Carlos Santana added a solo homer in the sixth. Encarnacion narrowly missed a game-tying home run later in the inning when his high drive to left hit off the wall for a double.	"We didn't get much going besides the home runs," Indians manager Terry Francona said. "That was kind of our offense."	David Robertson -- Chicago's fifth pitcher -- recorded the final six outs for his 10th save.	Abreu's RBI single gave Chicago the lead and Matt Davidson's bases-loaded single scored two runs.	Michael Brantley dropped Leury Garcia's fly ball for a three-base error in the second. Cabrera, who had three hits, singled with two outs for a 4-0 lead.	SLUMPING	Indians shortstop Francisco Lindor was 0 for 3 with a walk, dropping his average to .259. He's batting .146 (6 for 41) in his last 11 games.	"I think you'll see he's too good a hitter not to get hot," Francona said. "And this is probably the lowest he's been average-wise. That's pretty good."	WELCOME ABOARD	White Sox 2B Alen Hanson joined the team after being claimed off waivers from Pittsburgh. The 24-year-old former top prospect batted .193 in 37 games with the Pirates.	"He seems like a very nice kid, so a change of scenery could help him," Renteria said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox: LHP Carlos Rodon (biceps bursitis) will make his second rehab start for Triple-A Charlotte on Sunday. He has been on the DL since April 2.	Indians: RHP Danny Salazar (sore shoulder) has been ruled out of starting in the June 17 doubleheader against Minnesota. Salazar was placed on the DL this week and experienced stiffness in a throwing session Thursday.	UP NEXT	White Sox: LHP Jose Quintana seeks his first victory since May 2 at Kansas City. He has made six starts since beating the Royals, going 0-3 with a 6.68 ERA.	Indians: RHP Carlos Carrasco, pitching on seven days' rest, faces the White Sox for the third time this season. He has a win and a no-decision and has allowed one run in 15 innings.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

NEW YORK -- Aaron Judge, Gary Sanchez and the rest of Yankees' young sluggers are locked in and scoring in bunches.	Judge hit his major league-leading 19th home run and New York slugged five homers overall, battering Chris Tillman and the Baltimore Orioles 16-3 on Saturday night for their fourth straight win.	"We're just not missing our pitch," Judge said. "We're getting deep into counts, and when you leave something over the middle, we're depositing it and doing some damage."	Sanchez, Starlin Castro, Didi Gregorius and Matt Holliday also homered in New York's biggest offensive show this season. The first-place Yankees have outscored Boston and Baltimore, their closest competitors in the AL East, 41-6 during their winning streak.	"It's incredible," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "There's a lot of power in this lineup, and we can score quickly."	Luis Severino (5-2) pitched seven sharp innings, giving up one run and two hits. He struck out eight and walked two.	Tillman (1-4) was tagged for nine runs in only 1⅓ innings. He got two quick outs to begin the first before Judge's homer began a six-run burst.	"I was in such a hurry to get the breaking stuff going, it kind of snowballed real quick," Tillman said.	Holliday singled, Castro doubled and Sanchez lined a two-run single. Gregorius launched Tillman's next offering into the right-field seats, extending the lead to 5-0, with all those runs scoring in a span of eight pitches.	After Chase Headley walked and moved up on a wild pitch, Chris Carter hit an RBI single.	Tillman walked Judge and Holliday on eight straight balls with one out in the second. Castro drove a 3-0 pitch 452 feet over the Baltimore bullpen to make it 9-0, ending Tillman's outing.	Holliday hit a three-run homer in the fourth and Judge added a two-run double in the fifth. Holliday and Judge each had three of New York's 18 hits and scored three times.	Severino earned his third consecutive win. He was perfect until walking Mark Trumbo to begin the fifth, and all of Severino's strikeouts came on swings.	Chris Davis and Joey Rickard homered for the Orioles.	BULLPEN SHUFFLE	The Yankees designated LHP Tommy Layne for assignment after the game and will recall RHP Domingo German from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. Layne has a 7.50 ERA in 18 appearances this season, all in relief. German, 24, has not appeared in a major league game.	STRANDED	Caleb Joseph's pinch-hit RBI single in the ninth snapped an 0-for-45 stretch by New York opponents with runners in scoring position, dating to May 31. It was the Yankees staff's longest such streak in the expansion era (since 1961) and the longest stretch of hitless at-bats with runners in scoring position in the majors since the Montreal Expos also held opponents hitless 45 times in 1982.	POUNDING THE GAVEL	The exit velocity on Judge's solo shot was 121.1 mph, making it the hardest-hit home run recorded since Statcast began tracking the statistic in 2015.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: C Welington Castillo (testicular injury) was reinstated from the 10-day disabled list prior to the game. He was 0-for-3. ... LHP Zach Britton (left forearm strain) threw a successful bullpen session on Saturday and has another scheduled for Monday. On the disabled list since May 6 (retroactive to May 5), the All-Star closer will throw live batting practice on Thursday.	Yankees: 1B Greg Bird (right ankle bruise) went 2-for-5 with an RBI at Triple-A on Saturday in his ninth rehab game. There is no timetable for his return. "Our people determined that he's not ready to come back yet," manager Joe Girardi said. ... LHP Aroldis Chapman (left shoulder) struck out three and walked one in one inning during a simulated game against minor leaguers on Saturday morning. He has been on the DL since May 14 with rotator cuff inflammation. Chapman is scheduled to pitch one inning on Tuesday with Class A Tampa and another at Double-A Trenton on Friday. Girardi hopes that the 29-year-old can be activated next weekend in Oakland. ... CF Jacoby Ellsbury (concussion) will not join the Yankees on their upcoming West Coast trip. He will work out with Trenton, although he is not expected to play in any games this week. Ellsbury has been riding an exercise bike, running on a treadmill and playing catch.	UP NEXT	Orioles: RHP Kevin Gausman (3-4, 5.86 ERA) tries to help Baltimore avoid a sweep in the series finale. He beat the Yankees May 31 in Baltimore despite allowing eight hits and five walks over 5 1/3 innings.	Yankees: RHP Masahiro Tanaka, originally slated to start, was pushed back to Monday in Anaheim. He has lost five straight starts during the worst stretch of his career (27 runs in 22 2/3 innings, including 11 home runs). RHP Chad Green (0-0, 1.62 ERA in seven relief outings) will make his first start of the season in Tanaka's place.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SEATTLE --  Kendrys Morales, Ezequiel Carrera and Justin Smoak, all one-time members of the Seattle Mariners organization, provided the big blows for a game that sounded like it belonged in Toronto.	Carrera led off the eighth inning with his fifth homer of the season to break a 2-all tie, Morales and Smoak each added long balls and the Blue Jays continued their reliance on the home run in a 4-2 win over the Mariners on Saturday night.	"We love home runs. We scored all our runs off home runs. I don't know if you can do that forever, but right now it's working," Toronto manager John Gibbons said.	Morales' two-run shot in the fourth inning, his 12th of the season, stood as Toronto's only hit until the seventh. After Seattle pulled even at 2-all, Carrera drove a sinker from Tony Zych (2-2) that stayed in the middle of the plate deep to right field, generating a huge roar from the thousands of Toronto fans in town for the weekend series.	"He gave me a cookie, threw the ball a little bit high fastball and I took advantage of it," Morales said through an interpreter.	Smoak added one more jolt, hitting his 18th homer leading off the ninth inning. And it happened that all three homers came from one-time Mariners properties, although Carrera never played in the majors with Seattle.	Toronto starter Marcus Stroman (7-2) was outstanding, winning his sixth straight decision. Stroman allowed one earned run in seven innings, and it took the help of two errors on one play for Seattle to score its second run and pull even.	Stroman struck out six and walked none, and the Blue Jays have won the last seven games he has started. Seattle's only earned run off Stroman came on back-to-back singles by Nelson Cruz and Kyle Seager in the second inning, helped by a wild pitch that got Cruz into scoring position.	"It's fun man. It feels similar to playoffs. It's weird having a road game that is essentially a home game for us," Stroman said.	Joe Smith got out of a jam in the eighth by striking out Seager and getting Taylor Motter to ground out after Seattle had runners at the corners and one out. Roberto Osuna pitched the ninth for his 15th save as Seattle again failed to climb above the .500 mark after reaching the break-even point for the third time this season.	Seattle starter Ariel Miranda allowed just two hits in 6 1/3 innings but was pulled in the seventh after issuing his fifth walk of the game, setting a new career high.	JUST KEEP RUNNING	The run Seattle got to pull even in the seventh came in the most unlikely of ways. Dyson led off with a single and stole second base early in the at-bat to Carlos Ruiz. Russell Martin's throw was low and skipped into the outfield, allowing Dyson to advance. But Kevin Pillar also misplayed the ball in center field, and Dyson never stopped at third base, scoring on a play more common to Little League than the majors.	"That's really something I've never seen before on our side," Seager said of Dyson. "We've had some guys that can run before, but nothing to the extent that he can do. He's really special."	ROSTER MOVE	Seattle recalled right-handed reliever Emilio Pagan from Triple-A Tacoma and optioned RHP Tyler Cloyd. Cloyd got the victory in Friday's win, but due to Tommy John surgery can't pitch on consecutive days, so the Mariners wanted an extra arm in the bullpen.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: Toronto hopes to get IF Steve Pearce (calf) back by next weekend. Peace played his second rehab game for Double-A New Hampshire on Friday.	Mariners: RHP Felix Hernandez will be limited to 65 pitches in his rehab start on Sunday with Triple-A Tacoma, and is expected to make at least one more rehab start before rejoining the Mariners rotation. ... RHP Hisashi Iwakuma will throw a simulated game on Sunday and likely go out on a rehab assignment next week. ... OF Mitch Haniger (oblique) is in line to be activated from the disabled list on Sunday.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays: J.A. Happ (0-4) is still looking for his first win after 20 games last season. Happ pitched 5 1/3 innings in his last start against Oakland, his second since coming off the disabled list.	Mariners: James Paxton (5-0) looks to keep his mark perfect on the season. Paxton allowed three runs in five innings in his last start where he picked up his fifth victory.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

LOS ANGELES --  Corey Seager has been playing baseball of some sort since 1997, and Saturday night marked a surprising first for the Dodgers star.	When Seager's ball eluded left fielder Scooter Gennett in the bottom of the ninth inning for a run-scoring double, it gave Los Angeles a 5-4 victory over the Cincinnati Reds -- and a new accomplishment for Seager.	A walk-off hit.	"No high school, no summer ball, no minor leagues, no nothing," Seager said.	It was Seager's second double and it made a loser of reliever Drew Storen (1-2), who allowed one-out singles to Yasiel Puig and Justin Turner to set the stage for Seager in the ninth.	Kenley Jansen (4-0) pitched a scoreless ninth for the victory.	The Dodgers built a 4-1 lead but it came undone when manager Dave Roberts replaced starter Alex Wood with two on and two outs in the sixth with reliever Josh Fields.	Devin Mesoraco greeted Fields with the three-run homer to tie it. It was his fifth home run of the season.	The Dodgers took a 3-0 lead in the first against starter Asher Wojciechowski.	A single by Chase Utley and double by Seager scored one. After Seager scored on a sacrifice fly by Adrian Gonzalez, rookie Cody Bellinger hit his team-high 13th home run.	"After that first inning, I just tried to settle down, go as deep as I could, and give this team a shot," Wojciechowski said.	Cincinnati got one back in the third against Wood, making his first start since coming off the disabled list. Gennett doubled and scored on Jose Peraza's single.	That snapped a 27-inning scoreless streak by Wood.	"I felt good," Wood said. "I felt my stuff was pretty good."	The Dodgers went up 4-1 in the fifth after Puig doubled and was sacrificed to third by Wood. Utley doubled to score Puig.	Wood went 5 2/3 innings in his first start since May 26 and was charged with three runs and five hits. He struck out seven and did not walk a batter.	And then watched a little personal history as Seager delivered his first game-ending hit.	"I'm betting it won't be his last," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: OF Adam Duvall missed his second consecutive start with an illness. He did pinch hit. Manager Bryan Price said he expects him back either in the series finale Sunday or Monday in San Diego. ... RHP Homer Bailey (elbow surgery) threw five scoreless innings in his first rehab start at Double-A Pensacola on Friday, allowing three hits and a walk while striking out five. Price said he would likely need at least two more rehab starts.	Dodgers: OF Joc Pederson (concussion, neck) hit his second home run in as many rehab games at Triple-A Oklahoma City. Pederson was batting only .200 with two home runs in 35 games with the Dodgers. "I appreciate that he wants to be here, but we want to make sure that he can come help us when he does get here," Roberts said. ... When the Dodgers activated Wood, they optioned RHP Brandon Morrow back to Triple-A Oklahoma City. Morrow has not allowed a run in five appearances.	PERFECT JANSEN	Jansen is not only 4-0 and 10 of 10 in save opportunities, he has struck out 42 without walking a single batter. Said Roberts: "For me, the best closer in the game. He's automatic right now. He has a lot of confidence."	COZART STREAK	When Wood hit Zack Cozart with a pitch in the sixth, it extended his on-base streak to 32 consecutive games. It's the longest in the majors this season.	UP NEXT	Reds: RHP Tim Adleman (4-2) will look to continue his recent turnaround Sunday. In his last three starts, he has allowed only four earned runs in 21 innings (1.71 ERA). In his only appearance against the Dodgers last August, he did not allow a run in five innings.	Dodgers: LHP Hyun-Jin Ryu (2-6) will start in the series finale for Los Angeles. Ryu temporarily lost his place in the rotation, and likely did not cement his return in his last start, taking the loss after allowing four runs and seven hits in seven innings against the Nationals.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

PHOENIX --  Zack Godley keeps coming back from Reno and making big starts for the Arizona Diamondbacks.	The latest was Saturday night, when the right-hander allowed two hits over 6 2/3 innings in the Diamondbacks' 3-2 win over the Milwaukee Brewers.	Brandon Drury hit the go-ahead two-run home run for Arizona.	Rey Fuentes tripled and scored the other run for the Diamondbacks, who had their nine-game home winning streak snapped in an 8-6 loss to the Brewers on Friday.	Hernan Perez accounted for both Milwaukee runs with his second homer in as many nights.	Godley (2-1) allowed two runs, struck out four, walked one and hit a batter. He was pulled by manager Torry Lovullo after only 80 pitches.	"Maybe he had a little more life left in him," Lovullo said, "but I thought he had done his job and it was time to turn it over to the bullpen."	Andrew Chafin, Archie Bradley and Fernando Rodney held the Brewers hitless in relief.	Domingo Santana walked to start the Brewers ninth but was thrown out by Chris Iannetta trying to steal second and Rodney earned his 16th save in 19 tries.	Godley, who has started seven times since Shelby Miller's season-ending elbow injury, began the season in Triple-A Reno and has been sent back twice as the Diamondbacks shuffled their roster.	But he was back to make a big start on Saturday night, lowering his ERA to 2.44. But he could be headed down to the minors yet again.	"All I can control is what I can control," Godley said, "when they give me the opportunity to pitch, I try to take advantage of that."	Junior Guerra (1-1) permitted three runs on five hits in six innings in a strong outing for Milwaukee.	"He struggled with his rhythm early, then I thought after the third inning he really cruised in the fourth and fifth inning," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. "He was really cruise in the sixth but give Drury credit."	The Brewers led 2-1 through five innings and Guerra retired David Peralta and Paul Goldschmidt to start the sixth. But Chris Owings singled to bring up Drury, who worked the count to 3-2 and hit the next pitch over the wall in left to give the Diamondbacks a 3-2 lead.	"He got me down 0-2 and I was just trying to battle," Drury said. "I kind of thought he was going to come with the splitfinger 3-2 and he did, and I just put a good swing on it."	Godley retired 11 of the first 12 batters he faced before he hit Jesus Aguilar with two outs in the fourth inning. On the next pitch, Perez homered into the left-field seats that put Milwaukee up 2-0.	With one out in the fifth, left fielder Eric Thames got a late break on Fuentes' short fly ball, made an unsuccessful dive for it and the ball rolled past him for a triple.	Fuentes scored on Godley's ground out to shortstop Orlando Arcia, who threw home. Initially, umpire Tripp Gibson called Fuentes out. But the call was overturned after a review showed Reyes' hand touching the plate just ahead of catcher Manny Pina's tag, and Arizona cut the lead to 2-1.	BIG CROWD	Attendance was 40,195, the second-largest home crowd of the season for Arizona.	The first 20,000 got a free Diamondbacks beach towel and it was "Native American Recognition Day."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: Milwaukee placed 2B Jonathan Villar on the 10-day DL with a back strain. He was injured when he made a diving stop of a ground ball and threw the runner out late in Friday night's game. OF Lewis Brinson, a top prospect, was recalled from Triple-A Colorado Springs.	Diamondbacks: RHP Taijuan Walker (finger blister) pitched a bullpen session Saturday, part with the finger bandaged and part without. Manager Torry Lovullo said Walker could be ready to return to the rotation soon. .... CF A.J. Pollock (right groin strain) ran in the outfield before Saturday's game and is getting closer to returning to baseball activity.	UP NEXT	Two pitchers who have been among the best in the game in recent weeks will start in Sunday's series finale -- Milwaukee RH and ex-Diamondback Chase Anderson (5-1, 2.94 ERA) and Arizona LH Robbie Ray (6-3, 2.85). Anderson took a no-hitter into the seventh inning against Arizona on May 27 and has pitched 21 2/3 consecutive scoreless inning. Ray has won his last four starts, allowing one run in 30 1/3 innings. He pitched seven scoreless innings in Milwaukee on May 25.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

NEW YORK --  His day done, Aaron Judge put on a "Great Hambino" shirt -- yellow and short-sleeved, loaded with images of a young boy pointing his finger and resting a bat over his shoulder, just like Babe Ruth.	How fitting.	Judge hit two more home runs, including a drive nearly 500 feet that cleared the distant bleachers at Yankee Stadium and sent New York romping past Baltimore 14-3 Sunday for its fifth straight win.	Still, the rookie sensation with the shirt referencing a character from the movie "The Sandlot" didn't sound too impressed. Unlike his teammates and a sellout crowd of 46,348, who were awed by Judge's latest achievements.	"If I know it's going over the fence, I am going to start jogging and just get around the bases and get back in the dugout," he said.	Yet even by his lofty feats, it was quite a power show by the 6-foot-7 Judge. He leads the majors with 21 homers and tops the AL with 47 RBI and a .344 batting average.	In the sixth, Judge launched a mammoth shot to left-center field that was estimated at 495 feet, the longest homer in the majors this season, according to Statcast. The ball bounced off the bare hands of a fan standing behind a fence beyond the back row of the bleachers.	Then again, out that far, who could expect to need a glove for a souvenir?	The Yankees on the bench had their mouths wide open in amazement, pointing to where the ball traveled. Shortstop Didi Gregorius lifted up diminutive infielder Ronald Torreyes for a high-five with Judge.	Judge sent a shot into the right-center seats in his next at-bat, and also doubled earlier.	"He hit a line drive to right field. It was just a line drive," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "Most guys, they're hoping it gets in the gap. It just went out. I mean his power is incredible."	The 25-year-old Judge has done enough to lead all American League players in fan voting for starting spots in the All-Star Game. The outfielder enhanced his credentials by going 4 for 4 with a walk, scoring four times and driving in three.	Starlin Castro homered and drove in five runs for the AL East leaders. Gary Sanchez also connected, capping a five-run first inning off Kevin Gausman (3-5).	"I think they swung at the first four pitches I threw, so obviously they're all feeling pretty hot right now, feeling comfortable", Gausman said.	The Yankees scored at least eight runs for the fifth straight game, matching the team's best streak since 1939. New York swept the three-game series, and outscored the Orioles and Boston 55-9 during this five-game run.	"I know these three days up here, last four days, actually, have been frustrating," Orioles outfielder Adam Jones said. "But let's get the hell out of New York, let's go to Chicago, redeem ourselves and just flip the script."	Adam Warren (2-1) got credited with the win, pitching 1 1/3 scoreless innings.	Gausman gave up eight hits, seven runs and walked six in 3 1/3 innings. He walked Matt Holliday with one out to load the bases in the first and Castro began his big offensive day with a two-run single. Sanchez followed with his 10th homer.	The Orioles, playing without injured All-Star third baseman Manny Machado (strained left wrist) for the fourth straight game, chased New York starter Chad Green in the third with back-to-back doubles that made it 5-1.	Baltimore hit two more doubles, giving them four in a row, off reliever Chasen Shreve that reduced the Yankees' lead to 5-3.	WELCOME TO THE SHOW	Yankees pitching prospect Domingo German made his major league debut in the seventh. He gave up two hits, walked a batter and struck out one without allowing a run in the final 2 2/3 innings. He was sent back to Triple-A after the game, and the Yankees plan to promote righty Ben Heller on Monday.	COMING AND GOING	Baltimore added some fresh arms to its bullpen prior to Sunday's series finale, recalling Logan Verrett and selecting the contract of Jimmy Yacabonis from Triple-A Norfolk. They both gave up a home run to Judge.	To make room for both right-handed relievers, Stephen Crichton was optioned to Triple-A and Edwin Jackson, a 15-year vet, was designated for assignment.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: Machado hit off a tee, made some throws and fielded some grounders before the game. He was available to pinch hit but there's a possibility he can play Monday.	Yankees: Jacoby Ellsbury, on the disabled list since May 25 due to a concussion and neck sprain, is scheduled to join Double-A Trenton, perhaps on Tuesday, according to Girardi.	UP NEXT	Orioles: Wade Miley (2-3, 3.27) tries to halt Baltimore's four-game losing streak Monday night in Chicago as he takes the mound in the opener of a four-game set against the White Sox. The lefty lasted just 2 2/3 innings in his last outing last Wednesday against Pittsburgh, allowing four runs and eight hits.	Yankees: Masahiro Tanaka (5-6, 6.55) starts the first game of a seven-game West Coast road trip Monday when he faces the Angels. Tanaka was scheduled to start Sunday but got an extra day off in the midst of the toughest stretch of his career, in which he's lost five straight starts (27 runs in 22 2/3 innings, including 11 homers).	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

CLEVELAND --  Carlos Carrasco got the Cleveland Indians to the sixth inning, and Andrew Miller and company took over from there.	Miller, Bryan Shaw and Cody Allen combined for 3 2/3 innings of one-hit relief, helping the Indians top the Chicago White Sox 4-2 on Sunday.	"We have an unbelievable bullpen," Carrasco said. "It was amazing."	Carrasco (6-3) was pulled after Todd Frazier's two-run double cut Cleveland's lead to one. The right-hander allowed seven hits, struck out four and walked one in 5 1/3 innings.	Miller retired all five batters he faced, striking out three. Shaw pitched a scoreless eighth and Allen finished for his 15th save, working around a one-out single.	The White Sox knew what they were getting into when the Indians went to their late-inning relievers.	"They're very good," Frazier said. "That's why they made it to the World Series last year. That's what they do best, all three of those guys."	Carrasco struck out Melky Cabrera to begin the sixth but then hit Jose Abreu on the left elbow. The big first baseman, who was hit on the left knee by Miller on Friday, crouched over at the plate and slowly walked to first.	Avisail Garcia's double put runners at second and third before Frazier's double made it 3-2. Miller struck out Yolmer Sanchez and Tim Anderson and retired the side in order in the seventh.	"As soon as I saw Miller, I said, `This inning is over.' I just left the man on second base right there," Carrasco said.	Cleveland is off Monday, making 11 outs for its bullpen no big deal.	"That was one of those where we were able to win today, we can't do that -- after this off day, we have 23 (games) in 21 days," manager Terry Francona said. "Today we could, knowing there was an off day."	Francisco Lindor, Roberto Perez and Erik Gonzalez each drove in a run for Cleveland.	The White Sox have dropped nine of 11. Jose Quintana (2-8) allowed three runs in five innings, dropping to 0-4 in his last seven starts.	Lindor, who was in a 6-for-44 slump, tacked on an RBI double in the seventh.	The Indians thought they had a run in the sixth, but third base umpire Bruce Dreckman ruled Edwin Encarnacion's towering fly ball down the line was foul. Encarnacion, who started his home run trot, immediately signaled the ball was fair and Francona came on the field.	A crew chief review ensued as Encarnacion impatiently stood at home plate and leaned on his bat. The call stood, drawing boos from the crowd. Encarnacion worked the count to 3-2 and fired his bat to the ground after hitting a tapper to pitcher Chris Beck.	Encarnacion's drive cleared the porch and landed on a walkway adjacent to the scoreboard in left field.	BAD LUCK	Chicago center fielder Leury Garcia exited after jamming his left middle finger twice on the bases. He was initially hurt leading off the game on a headfirst slide into first, and then was kicked on the hand by Lindor on an attempted steal in the fifth.	"We're hoping it's not a long-term thing," manager Rick Renteria said. "He's day to day for now."	GOOD GAME, KID	Gonzalez started at second base, giving Jason Kipnis a day off. The rookie went 2 for 3 with his first career RBI, and also made an outstanding play to start the game.	Leury Garcia hit a hard grounder that glanced off Carrasco's glove. Gonzalez made a backhand stab of the ball and made an off-balance throw to first for the out.	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox: RHP James Shields (strained right lat) has made two rehab starts for Triple-A Charlotte. He has been on the disabled list since April 21.	Indians: OF Abraham Almonte (strained right shoulder) had two hits for Triple-A Columbus on a rehab assignment Saturday.	UP NEXT	White Sox: RHP Mike Pelfrey will go in the opener of a four-game series against Baltimore on Monday.	Indians: RHP Trevor Bauer opens a three-game series against the Dodgers on Tuesday.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Mallex Smith is fitting in nicely with the Tampa Bay Rays.	Smith had three hits and used his speed to set up the go-ahead run and the Rays took three of four from the Oakland Athletics with a 5-4 victory Sunday.	Smith had a bunt single leading off the seventh and went to third after reliever Daniel Coulombe (0-1) was charged with an error for an errant throw to first that ended up in the right-field corner. Tampa Bay went ahead 5-4 when Corey Dickerson hit a sacrifice fly on the next pitch.	"Just see if he can make a play," Smith said about his decision for the bunt.	The error was Oakland's major league-high 62nd. The Athletics are 9-23, including 1-7 in one-run games, on the road.	"It's been frustrating," Oakland manager Bob Melvin said.	Smith, recalled from Triple-A Durham on Friday to fill in for injured Gold Glove center fielder Kevin Kiermaier, also walked and went 8 for 14 in the series.	"Just another strong game on his part," Rays manager Kevin Cash said.	Kiermaier is expected to miss at least two months with a broken right hip.	Chase Whitley (2-1) replaced Chris Archer in the top of seventh and worked out of a two-on, no-out jam.	Oakland loaded the bases with one out in the ninth before Alex Colome retired Jed Lowrie and Khris Davis for his 18th save.	Stephen Vogt had three RBI for Oakland, which has lost eight consecutive road series. The previous time the Athletics had a worst stretch was in 1986 when they dropped nine in a row.	Davis drove in a run with a single in the sixth to put Oakland 4-3, but Colby Rasmus pulled Tampa Bay even in the bottom of the inning with a solo homer.	Vogt had a two-run single in the second and made it 3-0 with a fourth-inning RBI double.	The Athletics lost twice in the series after going up by three runs.	After striking out the first two batters in the fifth, Jesse Hahn allowed five consecutive hits as Tampa Bay tied it at 3.	Smith and Dickerson had consecutive run-scoring doubles before Evan Longoria hit an RBI single.	"I have to do a better job to minimize the damage there," Hahn said. "Even after the first couple hits, I have to do something there to get that next out."	Hahn, winless in his past 10 road starts, allowed three runs and seven hits in five innings.	Archer gave up four runs and seven hits over six innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: RHP Kendall Graveman (right shoulder) resumed playing catch. ... INF Marcus Semien (right wrist) is hitting soft toss.	Rays: RHP Jumbo Diaz (right arm fatigue) was reinstated from the 10-day disabled list and worked a scoreless eighth.	HIT PARADE?	The Athletics had double-digit hits in each of the final three games of the series but won just once. It's the eighth time overall Oakland has lost when getting 10 or more hits.	CHRIS' COUNT	Archer threw 114 pitches, the 23rd straight time he has reached the century mark. It's the longest stretch in team history.	UP NEXT	Athletics: RHP Jharel Cotton (3-6), 0-2 with a 4.15 ERA in his past three starts, goes against Miami RHP Jose Urena (4-2) Tuesday night. RHP Daniel Gossett will be recalled from Triple-A Nashville to start Wednesday's game with the Marlins.	Rays: RHP Jake Odorizzi (4-3) and Toronto RHP Marco Estrada (4-4) are Tuesday night's starters. Odorizzi has allowed a homer in eight consecutive starts.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ATLANTA --  Seth Lugo senses that the New York Mets shouldn't be written off just yet.	"I think taking three out of four on the road is huge," he said. "It'll give us some momentum going home playing a couple of good teams."	Lugo became the latest member of the Mets to make a successful return, pitching seven impressive innings in his season debut to lead New York over the Atlanta Braves 2-1 Sunday.	Lugo (1-0) came back from right elbow inflammation that sidelined him all season, helping Mets starters post a 0.83 ERA over the last five games. He gave up one run and six hits, striking out seven and walking two. Lugo also doubled off Jaime Garcia (2-5) and scored in the third for a 2-1 lead.	On Saturday, the Mets swept a doubleheader from the Braves. Yoenis Cespedes was activated from the disabled list and hit a grand slam in the opener, then a healthy Steven Matz made his season debut and won the nightcap.	With Lugo and Matz back in the rotation, manager Terry Collins will use six starters this week. The rotation, which is without injured ace Noah Syndergaard, still has a lot of work to do. New York starters are 19-19 and rank 23rd in the major leagues with a 4.73 ERA.	"I thought our pitching was rounding into shape about a week ago and right now with those guys added to the rotation -- even though we're with six men this week -- I think we're going to start seeing what we expected," Collins said.	The Mets have won four of five heading into a 14-game stretch against four teams that made the postseason last year.	Closer Addison Reed got his 11th save in 13 chances.	Wilmer Flores, who went 6 for 9 in the doubleheader sweep, put the Mets ahead with a sacrifice fly in the first. Lugo scored on Juan Lagares' infield single in the third.	Dansby Swanson had a sacrifice fly for Atlanta. The Braves have lost 16 of their last 21 home games against the Mets.	Lugo, who has won six straight decisions dating to last Aug. 25, escaped a bases-loaded jam in the fifth when Matt Adams grounded into a double play. Collins successfully challenged that Adams didn't beat the throw, preventing the tying run from scoring.	Garcia struck out nine in seven innings. He has a 1.49 ERA over his last five starts but is 1/3 over that span.	"I've got to do a better job against the pitcher," Garcia said, referring to Lugo's double.	STRUGGLES AT THE PLATE	The Braves have grounded into 66 double plays, most in the NL. ... Adams went 1 for 14 in the series. ... Atlanta scored just three runs over the last three games, stranding 23 runners. ... Over the last four games, the Braves are hitting .121 with runners in scoring position.	STRUGGLES AT THE BAG	The umpiring crew had five calls overturned at first during the four-game series.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Collins said before the game that Cespedes will return to the lineup Monday and Tuesday at home against the Chicago Cubs. Cespedes popped up with the bases loaded as a pinch-hitter on Sunday.	ROSTER MOVES	With the return of Lugo, Cespedes and Matz over the last two days, the Mets optioned INF Matt Reynolds, RHP Tyler Pill and INF T.J. Rivera to Triple-A Las Vegas. LHP Sean Gilmartin, designated for assignment to make room for Lugo on the 40-man roster, was claimed off waivers by St. Louis. ... Braves LHP Eric O'Flaherty was placed on the 10-day disabled list with shoulder tendinitis. RHP Jason Hursh was recalled from Triple-A Gwinnett.	UP NEXT	Mets: RHP Jacob deGrom (4-3) allowed 15 runs in losing his last two starts, raising his ERA from 3.23 to 4.75. He is 1-2 with a 5.31 ERA in four career starts against the Cubs.	Braves: RHP Mike Foltynewicz (4-5) didn't allow a run over 14 innings of his last two starts, lowering his ERA from 4.44 to 3.48. He is 1-1 with a 3.38 ERA in three career starts against Washington.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

PITTSBURGH --  Elias Diaz is filling in quite nicely for injured catchers Francisco Cervelli and Chris Stewart.	Diaz drove in two runs, Ivan Nova pitched six shutout innings and the Pittsburgh Pirates beat Jeff Locke and the Miami Marlins 3-1 on Sunday.	Diaz drove in Jose Osuna and David Freese with a double in the first inning. Diaz also singled and scored on Jordy Mercer's single in the sixth inning.	Since Cervelli went on the disabled list Wednesday with a concussion, the 26-year-old Diaz is 7 for 14 with four RBI.	"He's got a hit in every game he's started, eight of them," manager Clint Hurdle said. "He's having a blast. Big hits. Swinging the bat aggressively. Two more hits. The big hit kind of loosens things up. And he's done a nice job behind the plate."	Nova also praised his defensive work.	"He's a great catcher," he said. "I told him right before the game, just call the game. I'm going to follow you. If I need to shake you off, I'm going to shake you off. I want you to do your job."	Nova (6-4) allowed one hit, struck out four and walked none. He showed no ill effects from the left knee inflammation that bothered him in his previous start, but he threw only 77 pitches.	Hurdle said the decision to pull him early was offense-related and Nova said he was good to go longer if needed.	Locke (0-2) was charged with three runs and eight hits in 5 1/3 innings in his first start in Pittsburgh since he signed with Miami in free agency. The left-hander spent the first six years of his career with the Pirates.	"I thought he was OK," Marlins manager Don Mattingly said. "It ends up being three runs, but again I think another solid outing that keeps us in the game if we're scoring any runs."	Ichiro Suzuki hit his second homer for Miami in the eighth. The 43-year-old Suzuki last hit more than one homer in a season in 2013.	It was Suzuki's 10th start of the year.	"I had to replace (Giancarlo) Stanton today, so maybe I should at least hit one," he said.	Felipe Rivero got his second four-out save in as many days. He threw just 12 pitches.	BIG UPS	Pittsburgh outfielder Andrew McCutchen may be having a down year at the plate, but he is still a gifted athlete.	With the bases loaded and McCutchen on third in the sixth, pinch hitter John Jaso grounded to first base. Tyler Moore stepped on the bag and threw home in plenty of time to get McCutchen. Out of desperation, McCutchen jumped completely over catcher J.T. Realmuto and the plate in attempt to evade the tag. Realmuto was able to make the play.	"Luckily, I didn't get hurt," McCutchen said, laughing. "The throw was going to beat me and he was going to be there waiting. I was trying to make something out of nothing. I didn't win."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: Stanton did not start, but struck out pinch-hitting in the eighth inning. He suffered a right wrist contusion on Saturday when he was hit with a pitch.	Pirates: LHP Antonio Bastardo (left quad strain) made his sixth rehab appearance with Triple-A Indianapolis on Saturday night and was charged with a run and two hits while recording two outs. He has a 4.26 ERA with Indianapolis.	UP NEXT	Marlins: Return home for an off day Monday after a 3-4 road trip. They open a two-game series with the Oakland Athletics on Tuesday.	Pirates: Jameson Taillon (2-1, 3.31 ERA) will make his first start since undergoing surgery to treat testicular cancer May 8 as the Pirates continue their homestand with a three-game series against the Colorado Rockies.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

HOUSTON --  No one is expecting Eric Young Jr. to do what Mike Trout did for the Los Angeles Angels while the two-time MVP recovers from thumb surgery.	But so far his contributions have been important in helping the Angels while Trout recovers.	Albert Pujols homered early and Young had a career-high four RBI, including a three-run shot in a six-run fifth inning and the Los Angeles Angels rallied for a 12-6 win over the Houston Astros on Sunday.	"E.Y. is making the most of an opportunity," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "He's gotten some big hits, playing good defense whether he's in center or left, running the bases aggressively. He definitely fits with these guys and he's playing great baseball."	Pujols hit his 601st career home run and his 56th against the Astros in the first inning, and the Angels had a 3-0 lead in the third before Houston got going.	The Astros scored six runs in the third and fourth innings combined, powered by homers from George Springer and Yuli Gurriel, to take a 6-3 lead.	The Angels scored three runs to tie it up in the fifth before Young connected off Michael Feliz (2-1) for his second home run this season to put the Angels up 9-6.	Young is hitting .318 with three doubles, two homers, seven RBI and four steals since his contract was purchased from Triple-A Salt Lake City on May 29 when Trout went on the disabled list.	"It's hard to replace a guy like that," Young said. "He's an MVP, multiple MVPs for a reason. I think I just focus on being myself and what I bring to the table and have fun while I'm out there."	Angels starter Jesse Chavez allowed four hits and six runs in 3 2/3 innings and rookie Keynan Middleton (1-0) pitched a scoreless fifth for his first career win.	Rookie David Paulino, who moved into the rotation this month with three starters on the disabled list, allowed six hits and five runs in four innings.	Kole Calhoun had two hits and three RBI and Andrelton Simmons added two hits and two RBI as the Angels won for the third time in four games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: RHP Joe Musgrove (shoulder) is expected to come off the disabled list to start for Houston on Monday. Musgrove last pitched on May 26.	AOKI'S MILESTONE	Houston OF Nori Aoki earned automatic entrance into Meikyukai or Golden Players Club, one of two Japanese baseball halls of fame, by collecting two hits on Sunday to give him 2,000 between the majors and Nippon Professional Baseball. After his double in the fourth inning, Aoki's 2,000th hit came on a single to left field to start Houston's sixth inning. Several Astros came out of the dugout to applaud Aoki, including Jose Altuve, who got the ball from the Angels and pretended to throw it into the stands before putting it away for safekeeping. Play was stopped for a minute as the video board showed a graphic congratulating Aoki on reaching the milestone. He tipped his cap and bowed to the crowd several times after receiving a loud ovation.	"Once I got my 2,000th hit, it brought back memories of my very first professional hit," he said. "It kind of made me look back, and the passion I have for baseball still hasn't changed."	He matched his season high in hits with a single in the eighth inning to give him 1,284 hits in Japan and 717 in the majors.	Aoki was presented with a Golden Players Club jacket after the game and the Astros presented him with an oversized bottle of wine signed by the team.	RECORD HOME RUN STREAK	Sunday was the 19th straight game in which the Astros have homered, which is the longest streak in franchise history. Houston, which is third in the majors with 97 homers, has hit 38 during this streak.	UP NEXT	Angels: Alex Meyer (2-3, 4.08 ERA) is scheduled to start for Los Angeles in the opener of a three game series against the Yankees on Monday. Meyer allowed three hits and one run, which was unearned, in six innings of a loss to Detroit in his previous start.	Astros: Barring any setbacks, Musgrove (4-4, 4.89) will start on Monday when Houston opens a three-game series against Yu Darvish and the Texas Rangers. Musgrove had his best performance in his previous start when he allowed four hits in seven scoreless innings in a 2-0 win over Baltimore.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ST. LOUIS --  The St. Louis Cardinals needed a big hit, and Dexter Fowler delivered -- again.	Fowler hit a three-run homer and Adam Wainwright tossed five solid innings, leading St. Louis to a 6-5 win over the Philadelphia Phillies on Sunday.	The Cardinals have won three in a row since a season-high seven-game losing streak.	Daniel Nava homered for the Phillies, who have dropped five in a row.	Philadelphia led 2-0 before Fowler connected against Aaron Nola (3-4) in the fifth inning. Eight of Fowler's nine homers in his first season with St. Louis have given his team the lead.	"I could have kissed him," Wainwright said. "That was such a big hit for us as a team, but also for me."	Tommy Pham, who had two hits, scored twice and drove in a run for St. Louis, said Fowler's homer served as a perfect pick-me-up.	"A big momentum-shifter right there," Pham said. "He's a clutch player."	Wainwright (7-4) gave up six hits, struck out four and walked two, bouncing back nicely from a rough start at Cincinnati on Tuesday. Seung Hwan Oh pitched a rocky ninth inning for his 15th save.	Wainwright needed 50 pitches to get through the first two innings, but allowed just one hit over his final three frames.	"I had very, very average stuff," Wainwright said. "It wasn't coming out great. But we found a way to win."	Nola gave up just four hits, but needed 93 pitches to get through five innings on a 90-degree afternoon.	"I just didn't execute the pitch where I wanted it," Nola said of the Fowler home run.	Pham and Eric Fryer added run-scoring singles in the sixth, and Kolten Wong's RBI double made it 6-3 Cardinals in the eighth. Wong's hit took on added importance when Oh faltered in the ninth.	Philadelphia pulled within one on RBI singles by Odubel Herrera and Howie Kendrick. Oh then got Tommy Joseph to fly to right with two runners on, ending the game.	"It was good to see us score off their closer in the ninth inning," Philadelphia manager Pete Mackanin said. "We just fell short again."	WORTH NOTING	Herrera went 3 for 5 with two RBI, extending his hitting streak to 10 games.	BUSCH DOMINATION	The Cardinals have won 11 of their last 13 games at home against Philadelphia and have captured the last five series between the teams in St. Louis.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: INF Cesar Hernandez was placed on the 10-day disabled list with a left oblique strain. He suffered the injury making a throw on Friday. ... RHP Joaquin Benoit was activated from the disabled list and got two outs, allowing two runs and three hits. He had been on the DL since June 3 with a left knee strain.	Cardinals: C Yadier Molina was held out of the lineup for the third straight game with lower back stiffness. He is expected to return to the lineup on Tuesday, according to manager Mike Matheny.	UP NEXT	Phillies: RHP Jerad Eickhoff (0-7, 5.15 ERA) will face Boston RHP Rick Porcello (3-8, 4.46 ERA) in the first of a two-games series against the Red Sox on Monday. The teams meet for two games in Philadelphia on Wednesday and Thursday.	Cardinals: RHP Lance Lynn (4-3, 2.88 ERA) will pitch on Tuesday afternoon against Milwaukee in the first game of a day-night doubleheader. LHP Marco Gonzales will make his season debut for St. Louis in the nightcap.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

CHICAGO -- Stuck in a season-long slump, Addison Russell helped the World Series champions get back to the .500 mark.	Russell had a go-ahead home run for his first big contribution since an absence in the wake of a Major League Baseball investigation into domestic abuse allegations, and the Chicago Cubs stopped the Colorado Rockies' seven-game winning streak, 7-5 Sunday.	Russell and Kyle Schwarber had back-to-back home runs in the sixth inning. Miguel Montero and Ben Zobrist also connected, helping the Cubs even get to 31-31.	This was Russell's second game since missing the first two games of the series. The MLB investigation began after claims of abuse against his wife were levied in a since-deleted social media post.	"It was pretty big, and then Schwarber coming up behind me and adding on," Russell said. "It feels good to see some success, a little bit. I definitely want to bask in it a little bit, but tomorrow is going to be another day."	Reliever Jordan Lyles (0-2) gave up both homers in the sixth. The NL West-leading Rockies ended their longest winning string since 2013.	Carl Edwards Jr. (2-0) won in relief of starter Jake Arrieta. Wade Davis gave up a run in the ninth before getting his 13th save in 13 chances as the Cubs snapped a four-game losing streak.	Russell, batting just .213, put the Cubs ahead 5-4 with his fourth home run. Schwarber, hitting only .171, followed with a pinch-hit drive for his 11th homer.	"It's all about confidence, man," Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. "As we continue to rebuild their confidence and they get it back, you're going to see a lot more of that. It's that simple."	Schwarber's towering fly to right field earned him a curtain call from the Wrigley Field fans on a 91-degree day.	"Addy got the hanging breaking ball and I was able to get a heater down and in. We had good at-bats pretty much the whole day, just watching," Schwarber said. "It's definitely a positive step to see our guys put up really good competitive at-bats."	Colorado rookie Antonio Senzatela labored through four innings, striking out six. He allowed four runs before getting an out in the first as Anthony Rizzo had an RBI double on a 10-pitch at-bat and Zobrist hit a three-run homer.	The Rockies responded with four runs in the fifth inning, all charged to Arrieta.	DJ LeMahieu walked with the bases loaded and, after Carlos Gonzalez was ejected arguing a called third strike, Mark Reynolds lined an RBI single to make it 4-2.	Edwards relieved and allowed a tying, two-run single by Ian Desmond.	Montero homered in the eighth. LeMahieu added an RBI single in the ninth before Davis got Alexi Amarista to pop out to end it. Amarista replaced Gonzalez after the ejection by umpire Marvin Hudson.	"It was a bad pitch. I said a few words he didn't like. He tossed me. As simple as that," Gonzalez said. "I think the whole situation, too, we got runners on, I got bases loaded, opportunity to keep the inning going, help the team score runs, so that's what really frustrated me."	TOUGH START	The four runs Senzatela allowed without getting an out in the first were the most he's allowed in an inning in his career, which is 13 starts old. His seven hits allowed also tied a career high.	QUOTABLE	Maddon said sometimes less information is more helpful to young hitters who are struggling, as Schwarber has been lately.	"Lately, I'm certain that Uber drivers have been telling him how to hit," Maddon said. "That's just how it works."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rockies: C Tom Murphy (forearm fracture) is about 7-10 days from returning, Black said.	UP NEXT	Rockies: LHP Kyle Freeland (7-3, 3.34 ERA) opens a three-game series in Pittsburgh on Monday, hoping to improve to 5-0 on the road this season.	Cubs: RHP John Lackey (4-6, 5.12) has lost three straight starts and begins a three-game series and six-game road trip Monday against the New York Mets. The Cubs play 17 of their next 20 games on the road.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

WASHINGTON --  Max Scherzer's milestone performances don't usually result in this kind of feeling.	The ace right-hander struck out 10 to move past 2,000 for his career, but was outpitched by Austin Bibens-Dirkx and the Texas Rangers beat the Washington Nationals 5-1 on Sunday for a sweep of their weekend series.	"It's really cool," said Scherzer, who also has two no-hitters, a 20-strikeout game and an NL Cy Young Award since joining Washington before the 2015 season. "But one of these days, I'll actually reflect on it. It stings a little bit when you get it in a loss. But you just keep marching on."	Scherzer (7-4) has 2,005 career strikeouts after fanning at least 10 batters seven times this season. He allowed three runs -- two earned -- and three hits in 7 1/3 innings.	By the end of the eighth, the Rangers had grabbed control against the NL East leaders on just one hit, aided by an error and a passed ball.	"It's a tough loss, a tough series," Nationals catcher Matt Wieters said. "But we've got to move past this and be ready to go to tomorrow."	Bibens-Dirkx (2-0) allowed a run and three hits in seven innings in his second career start. The 32-year-old rookie retired 19 straight after Brian Goodwin's first career leadoff homer and a single by Bryce Harper.	"I told my family I have to face Max Scherzer and (my wife said) `No, you get to," Bibens-Dirkx said. "(I said), `You're right. I've earned the right to be here."	Shin-Soo Choo slugged his ninth homer and second in as many games as Texas completed its first road sweep of the season.	Scherzer reached the 2,000 mark when he got Nomar Mazara swinging a 1-2 slider that tailed inside to open the fourth inning.	He struck out the side in the fifth and cruised until the eighth, when he exited after Delino DeShields reached on third baseman Anthony Rendon's error and pinch hitter Jurickson Profar walked.	"It's just an unfortunate error, an unfortunate hop," Scherzer said. "Sometimes that happens. And then I just couldn't stay within the zone there in the eighth against Profar."	Oliver Perez walked Choo to load the bases. DeShields scored on Wieters' passed ball. Elvis Andrus hit a two-run triple and scored on Mazara's sacrifice fly.	Bibens-Dirkx was sailing along before Rendon singled in the seventh. Adam Lind followed with a walk. After a visit from pitching coach Doug Brocail, Bibens-Dirkx got Wieters to ground out to end the threat.	"Very gutsy performance by Austin," Rangers manager Jeff Banister, "going against a premier pitcher in Major League Baseball in Max Scherzer, knowing that you really have to limit any chances this lineup has."	MORE INTERLEAGUE, PLEASE	After losing 11 of 14 overall before arriving in Washington, the Rangers' sweep improved their interleague record to 10-2. Texas is 20-30 against the AL.	A QUICK 2,000	In terms of innings pitched (1,784), Scherzer is the third-fastest to hit 2,000 strikeouts behind Pedro Martinez and Randy Johnson.	"It's crazy I'm even mentioned, I'm even among those guys," Scherzer said. "Those are my pitching idols. I'm growing up watching those guys."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: RHP Tyson Ross (thoracic outlet surgery) said he is ready to make his Texas debut after averaging 90 pitches over his last two rehab starts at Triple-A Round Rock. Banister did not commit to a return date. "My expectation is that if all things go well, his next start would be in the big leagues," Banister said. "When that day is is undecided."	Nationals: Closer Koda Glover was placed on the 10-day disabled list with lower back stiffness. Glover blew his second save in Saturday's 6-3, 11-inning loss and afterward told manager Dusty Baker he had been dealing with "nagging" back pain all day. ... Ryan Zimmerman (back) was out of the starting lineup for the third game in four days.	UP NEXT	Rangers: Begin a three-game series Monday at Houston. RHP Yu Darvish (5-4, 3.18 ERA) is winless with a 5.81 ERA in his last six outings against the Astros.	Nationals: RHP Stephen Strasburg starts the series opener against Atlanta on Monday. He's 6-1 with a 2.68 ERA against the Braves since 2015.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN FRANCISCO --  The San Francisco Giants busted out of their offensive slump without a couple of key players.	Buster Posey led the way.	Posey had three hits and four RBI, Hunter Pence added three doubles and scored three times, and the Giants beat the Minnesota Twins 13-8 on Sunday to avoid a three-game sweep.	Eduardo Nunez also had three hits and scored three times while rookie Austin Slater had three hits and a career-high four RBI to help the Giants win for the fourth time in 12 games.	"The way we swung the bats, especially with runners in scoring position ... everybody did something," manager Bruce Bochy said. "Any time you sit regulars like that and you get a win and come from behind, that's nice. Those guys needed at-bats and had big days for us."	San Francisco had been held to two runs over the first two games of the series before setting season highs for hits (17) and scoring. The Giants also had a San Francisco record-tying eight doubles despite Bochy holding shortstop Brandon Crawford, center fielder Denard Span and second baseman Joe Panik out of the starting lineup.	Posey, who entered the day with the fourth-best batting average in the majors, had an RBI groundout in the first, a run-scoring single in the fifth and a key two-run double in the seventh.	Kelby Tomlinson singled and scored twice in a rare appearance batting leadoff for San Francisco. Slater, who made his major league debut on June 2, had a bases-loaded triple in the ninth.	"Today was a good game offensively," said Posey, who raised his average to .347. "Hopefully we're going in the right direction. When we were able to get the lead, it seemed like guys were taking good, aggressive swings after that."	Pence bounced back after striking out three times Saturday and again in his first at-bat Sunday. He had an RBI double in the seventh and in the ninth. The veteran right fielder had been 7 for 51 before breaking out against the Twins.	Josh Osich (1-1) retired three batters for the win.	Eduardo Escobar and Byron Buxton homered for Minnesota. Matt Belisle (0-1) got two outs and was charged with four runs and four hits.	"We had a lead late," Twins manager Paul Molitor said. "Unfortunately a walk in the seventh turned into a disastrous seventh and we couldn't control them after that."	DYSON'S DAY	Reliever Sam Dyson didn't have the best of luck during his Giants debut. The former Texas closer failed to retire a batter in the ninth and was charged with three runs, two earned. Posey committed an error in the inning.	"He got a couple groundballs we couldn't handle," Bochy said. "He just had some bad luck unfortunately for him. He'll be fine. His stuff was really good. He just hadn't pitched in a while and I expected some rust."	ROOKIE DEBUT	San Francisco's offensive outburst spoiled the major league debut of Twins left-hander Nik Turley. The 27-year-old Turley, who spent 10 years in the minors, gave up four runs and nine hits in four-plus innings.	"I honestly can't remember what it felt like at the start," Turley said. "A lot of nerves. Sometimes it was hard for me to control what I wanted to do with my body."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Giants: Madison Bumgarner threw 30 pitches off a mound before the game and looked good, according to Bochy, who said that the left-hander could face hitters next weekend when the team plays in Colorado. It was Bumgarner's second time throwing off a mound since suffering a separated left shoulder and bruised ribs in dirt bike accident on April 20.	UP NEXT	Twins: LHP Adalberto Mejia (1-1, 4.18 ERA) pitches the opener of a four-game series against Seattle in Minnesota on Monday.	Giants: LHP Ty Blach (4-3, 3.64 ERA) makes his 10th start since replacing Bumgarner in the rotation when San Francisco opens a two-game series against the Kansas City Royals on Tuesday.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

SEATTLE --  Over three days that felt more like home games, the Toronto Blue Jays got depth from its starting pitching and -- of course -- another handful of home runs to find themselves back on the cusp of finally reaching the break-even mark.	Josh Donaldson hit a two-run homer in the first inning and finished with three RBI, J.A. Happ rediscovered the form that made him a 20-game winner last season with six shutout innings, and the Blue Jays beat the Seattle Mariners 4-0 on Sunday.	Donaldson and the Blue Jays knocked out Seattle starter James Paxton (5-1) after just four innings, handing him his first loss of the season and sending the thousands of Toronto fans from western Canada back north of the border after their team won two of three this weekend.	Toronto is 13-6 over its past 19 games, is 31-32 for the season and within a game of .500 for the third time since the opening week.	"Not damage to the point where I was trying to come unglued on him, but damage to where I could hit a ball in the gap and if I clip it enough maybe go deep," Donaldson said of his homer. "I was definitely going heater at that point because I know he's got a really good heater, as he should. I know he likes to go to it. He's blown me up with it a few times in the past."	Donaldson went opposite-field for his eighth homer of the season on a 2-0 pitch. He finished with three hits, including an RBI single in the fourth for a 3-0 lead. Toronto has hit home runs in 33 of 38 games since the start of May.	Kendrys Morales also had an RBI single in the fourth.	"It was good to see we scored other ways than the home run," Toronto manager John Gibbons said.	Happ (1-4) picked up his first win of the season in impressive fashion, skating around Seattle getting runners into scoring position but never allowed the big hit. Seattle twice had runners at third base with two outs, but Happ struck out Taylor Motter to end the second inning and got a groundout from Kyle Seager to end the third.	Happ allowed six hits but struck out eight in getting his first win since last Sept. 20. Toronto used six relievers to finish off its fourth shutout of the season, with closer Roberto Osuna getting Mitch Haniger for the final out and his 16th save.	"I felt strong out there," said Happ, who made his third start since missing more than a month with elbow issues. "I felt like I had probably more life than I had in my first two outings in my fastball today and I still felt strong. That's a good sign for sure."	Seattle was shut out for the sixth time.	Paxton was trying to become the eighth starting pitcher in club history to win his first six decisions of the season, but was off from the start. He worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the second inning, but had just one clean inning before getting pulled after the fourth.	Paxton allowed eight hits and walked three. He has pitched more than 5 1/3 innings just once since April 15.	"I just didn't feel great today," Paxton said. "I had a hard time finding my timing, my rhythm. I just didn't have a plan for getting myself where I needed to be."	ON THE FARM	Mariners ace Felix Hernandez made his second rehab start with Triple-A Tacoma on Sunday. He retired the first 14 batters before giving up a walk and a double. Hernandez allowed just one hit and struck out five, throwing 64 pitches. He's expected to make one more rehab start before rejoining the Mariners.	ROSTER RETURN	Seattle activated Haniger from the 10-day DL before Sunday's game. Haniger had been out since April 26 with a strained oblique after a scorching start to the season. He was 0 for 4 in his return. OF Boog Powell was optioned to Triple-A Tacoma.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays: After an off day on Monday, the Blue Jays open a series at home with Tampa Bay on Tuesday. Marco Estrada (4-4) starts the series opener.	Mariners: Yovani Gallardo (2-6) gets the start as Seattle opens a seven-game road trip in Minnesota on Monday. Gallardo allowed five runs in seven innings in his last start, also against the Twins.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

LOS ANGELES --  The Los Angeles Dodgers got back in the game with a little patience, and then Corey Seager finished the rally with one big swing.	Seager capped Los Angeles' six-run eighth inning with his first career grand slam, helping the Dodgers sweep the Cincinnati Reds with a 9-7 victory on Sunday.	Rookie Cody Bellinger sparked Los Angeles' rally with one-out drive against Austin Brice. Rasiel Iglesias (2-1) replaced Brice with a runner on first and walked three straight batters to force in a run, trimming Cincinnati's lead to 7-5. Seager then hit a drive to center for his ninth homer.	"You just kind of got to slow it down," Seager said. "Just try to get to the next guy, keep the line moving and try to get a win."	Seager also beat Cincinnati on Saturday night with an RBI double in the ninth for his first game-ending hit at any level.	"Outside of the skill set and the confidence -- because you've obviously got a very confident young player -- it's his ability to be able to control the pulse," manager Dave Roberts  said. "He's a guy that hits good pitching and performs in big spots, and he did again today."	Bellinger also homered in the second and Chase Utley connected in the fifth for the Dodgers, who have won four straight. Luis Avilan (1-1) pitched a scoreless inning for the win, and Kenley Jansen got three outs for his 200th career save.	Adam Duvall, Scott Schebler, Joey Votto and Devin Mesoraco homered for the Reds, who dropped their sixth consecutive road game.	"Those are the tough ones," manager Bryan Price said. "You're going to have a few of those. Hopefully only a couple a year where those leads get away late. But they happen every year."	Duvall led off the second with a drive to left and Schebler added a two-run homer, helping the Reds to a 3-0 lead. It was Duvall's 15th homer and No. 18 for Schebler.	After Votto connected for a solo shot in the third, Utley belted a solo drive in the fifth that went off the glove of center fielder Billy Hamilton.	The Reds opened a 7-3 lead on Mesoraco's three-run homer off Ross Stripling in the sixth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: Duvall made his first start after missing two games with an illness. ... LHP Brandon Finnegan (shoulder strain) made his first rehab start for Double-A Pensacola, throwing three scoreless innings.	Dodgers: LHP Scott Kazmir (hip) remains at the team's Arizona facility, building up arm strength through a weighted-ball program. Roberts said he was up to throwing 90-92 mph but they were working on him being able to maintain it. Roberts said they expect him to make a rehab start soon.	CLASSIC WALK	Enrique Hernandez put together a 13-pitch at-bat against Iglesias in the eighth, one that included eight foul balls, before walking to load the bases.	"The Hernandez at-bat was as good as you can get, really," Price said. "I thought he just did a tremendous job. Fought off some tough pitches."	GONZALEZ HURTING	Dodgers first baseman Adrian Gonzalez left in the seventh after complaining his back locked up again. He said he has two herniated disks and an MRI is scheduled.	"Tried my best to put together good at-bats and keep hitting pitches that I normally hit, but my body's not letting me get there, so you've got to do what's best for the team," he said.	UP NEXT	Reds: RHP Bronson Arroyo (3-4, 6.25 ERA) is scheduled to pitch the series opener Monday in San Diego. Arroyo, 40, missed two seasons following elbow and shoulder surgeries. In his 13 starts this season, he has yet to pitch past the sixth inning.	Dodgers: LHP Clayton Kershaw (8-2, 2.20 ERA) pitches Tuesday in the opener of a three-game series in Cleveland. The three-time NL Cy Young Award winner is having another dominating season. He has held opponents to a .204 batting average.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

PHOENIX --  The Arizona Diamondbacks have been tough to beat when Robbie Ray is on the mound, even more so when the hitters are clicking at the same time.	Ray struck out a season-high 12 in 6 2/3 shutout innings, Paul Goldschmidt had a grand slam and the Diamondbacks broke away late to rout the Milwaukee Brewers 11-1 Sunday.	Ray is 5-0 and has given up just one earned run in his last 37 innings, with 48 strikeouts over his last five starts.	"Felt great," Ray said. "All my pitches were working ... and the bats came alive there the end. That was impressive.	"I'm just going out there and trying to put up zeroes," he said.	Ray (7-3) gave up three hits and won what started as a pitchers' duel with former Diamondback Chase Anderson (5-2). Anderson allowed one run and four hits in six innings, and his scoreless streak stopped at 22 when Jake Lamb drove in David Peralta with a ground out in the bottom of the first.	Arizona led 1-0 when Ray came out of the game after back-to-back walks in the seventh. J.J. Hoover relieved and walked the bases loaded, but Jorge De La Rosa came on and struck out Eric Thames on three pitches to end the inning.	Ray struck out at least 10 for the ninth time in his career and fifth this season. He is the first Diamondbacks pitcher with double-digit strikeouts in three straight games since Randy Johnson's four-game stretch in 2004.	"We were all Robbie-watching in the dugout and really enjoying what he's doing," Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said. "I've become a fan, too. I'm just watching in amazement as to what he can do."	Chris Herrmann and David Peralta hit two-run homers and Brandon Drury added a solo shot in the Arizona seventh. Herrmann's drive came after he'd hit one just a few feet foul earlier in the at-bat, and Peralta pinged his off the left-field foul pole.	Goldschmidt's slam, the first of his career at Chase Field and fourth overall, came in a five-run eighth. He connected off Rob Scahill for his 14th homer of the season.	"We've got certainly more than one guy that is struggling (in the bullpen) a little bit right now," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. "Right now they've got to pitch and the only way to get on track is for them to pitch.  So we've got to put them put there and they've got to figure it out."	Arizona has homered in 15 straight games at home, which ties the longest streak in club history. Goldschmidt moved into sole possession of second place on the club's all-time home run list with 154, passing Steve Finley.	"I was just reminding myself, every at-bat counts and was just trying to be ready and was able to get that pitch," Goldschmidt said.	Goldschmidt's first-inning double gave him a franchise record for reaching base in 38 consecutive home games. Herrmann added a run-scoring double in the eighth.	Keon Broxton homered in the ninth for Milwaukee. The Brewers' streak of having a lead in a game ended at 16 games.	BRINSON DEBUTS	Brewers outfielder Lewis Brinson was at Chase Field for opening day in April, as a fan. A little more than two months later, he made his major league debut there for the Brewers. Brinson, playing left field and leading off, notched his first career stolen base in the third inning. He went 0 for 2 and walked twice.	A HARD GOODBYE	The return of ace Zack Greinke from the paternity leave list meant the Diamondbacks had to make a roster move, and veteran reliever Tom Wilhelmsen was designated for assignment. Wilhelmsen was 1-1 with a 4.44 ERA in 27 appearances this season and had 17 strikeouts and 12 walks.	Lovullo thanked Wilhelmsen and said he provided leadership and chemistry in the clubhouse for the bullpen, while keeping the mood positive and light with his manager. "He's impacted me as a first-year manager in a very positive way, and it was a tough conversation, it was tough to let him go," Lovullo said.	ROTATION CONSIDERATION	With RHP Taijuan Walker on the cusp of returning to the starting rotation from injury, the Diamondbacks have to decide who will go to the bullpen and who will remain in the rotation going forward, between Randall Delgado and Zack Godley.	Delgado is 1-1 with a 3.66 ERA in four starts. Godley is 2-1 with a 2.44 ERA in seven starts, and opponents are battling only .203 against him.	"When you have tough conversations because of their success, you know you've got a good organization, and that's what we have here," Lovullo said. "We've got depth. We've got guys that understand their roles. They're ready for their moment."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: Greinke returned to the team Sunday after he and his wife welcomed baby boy Griffin on Friday. ... OF A.J. Pollock's next step in his return from a groin injury is running the bases, which he will do this week. If cleared to move forward, Lovullo said he'd like Pollock to play in some rehab games before rejoining the team. ... Walker is on track to start on Wednesday in Detroit. He's been on the disabled list since May 21 with a blister on his right hand. ... OF Yasmany Tomas (right groin) will not go with the team on the road this week and will instead start baseball activity at the club's spring training facility. ... OF Socrates Brito (broken finger) was reinstated from the 60-day disabled list and optioned to Triple-A Reno.	UP NEXT	Brewers: RHP Jimmy Nelson (4-3) is slated to start one game of a doubleheader the Brewers play at St. Louis on Tuesday following an off-day. The other game's starter had yet to be determined after Sunday's game.	Diamondbacks: Greinke takes the mound in Detroit on Tuesday after an off day. He's 8-3 with a 3.20 ERA this season.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN DIEGO --  After his team hit five home runs on Saturday, Mike Moustakas was ready to keep the power surge going Sunday.	Moustakas hit two home runs and Jake Junis pitched seven-plus solid innings to help the Kansas City Royals beat the San Diego Padres 8-3.	Alex Gordon and Eric Hosmer also homered for the Royals.	"The offense gave us a big lead and Junis pitched on the attack," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "He executed pitches and had a really, really good slider. He held the fort for us."	Facing rookie Dinelson Lamet (2-2) Moustakas hit a three-run home run in the first that gave the Royals an early 4-0 advantage, and a solo homer in the eighth, his 17th this season.	"I saw it out of the hand and knew it was up and I tried to put a good swing on it, and it ended up carrying out of the yard," Moustakas said. "It definitely wasn't something that I was looking for, but when I saw it up I put some good wood on it."	Gordon homered in the fourth, a solo shot, and Hosmer added a two-run homer in the fifth to put Kansas City on top 7-1.	"He's really locked in," Yost said of Moustakas. "He is really putting together a great season this year power-wise. He is really seeing the ball well and driving the ball to all fields with power."	Junis (2-0), who lasted three and two-thirds innings in his previous start, allowed three runs, all on solo homers, on six hits over a career-best seven-plus innings. He struck out six and walked one.	"I felt like my off-speed was a little sharper today, and I was locating my fastball better than in previous outings," Junis said. "I was getting ahead and staying ahead."	Scott Alexander contributed two scoreless innings for Kansas City.	"Our bullpen has been used a lot," Moustakas said. "For (Junis) to come out and do what he did was unbelievable. We needed that big. He saved our bullpen."	Cory Spangenberg hit two solo home runs and Jose Pirela homered to chase Junis from the game in the eighth. Spangenberg recorded his second career two-homerun game for the Padres, who have lost seven of eight.	Lamet struggled for a second straight start after dominating in his first two. He gave up seven runs on six hits in five innings, while striking out six and walking one.	"I think more than anything today it was Lamet struggled with command," Padres manager Andy Green said. "That's gonna get you as long as the inning progresses."	Phil Maton made his major league debut for San Diego on the same day he was recalled from Triple-A El Paso with a scoreless eighth.	"Going in the game just didn't even seem real, just didn't want to hit the first guy, that's about the only thing that was going through my mind," Maton said. "Once I got that first pitch out of the way everything was okay."	QUOTABLE:	"I'm still missing mistakes; this game is hard. I just try to come in and try to figure out how to get hits every day." Moustakas said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: OF Manuel Margot continues his recovery from a calf injury and was running in the outfield prior to Sunday's game. Margot will likely require a rehab assignment before returning.	Royals: C Salvador Perez left the game with left-side tightness in his rib cage area. Perez is expected to start Tuesday in San Francisco.	UP NEXT:	Padres: RHP Luis Perdomo (0-3, 3.50) will make the start for San Diego on Monday, looking to rebound from his last time out in which he gave up five runs in four innings at Arizona. Perdomo opposes RHP Bronson Arroyo of the Cincinnati Reds.	Royals: LHP Jason Vargas (8-3, 2.18) takes the mound at San Francisco on Tuesday. Vargas has won three straight starts and faces Giants LHP Ty Blach.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BOSTON --  Detroit manager Brad Ausmus knew what to hope for when he saw Justin Upton's fly ball heading down the right-field line.	"From the time it left the bat I was saying, `Pesky Pole! Pesky Pole," Ausmas said after Upton's grand slam hit off the right-field foul pole, helping the Tigers avert a sweep with an 8-3 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Sunday night.	Nicholas Castellanos added a two-run homer for Detroit, which halted a three-game losing streak in a contest that lasted 4 hours, 6 minutes.	"I thought I hit it hard enough that it would run out of time to curve. It ended up being the case," Upton said. "Take them how you can get them."	Boston had won 13 of 19 and seven of eight in Fenway Park.	Daniel Norris (3-4) held Boston to two runs over five innings, giving up seven hits with three walks and six strikeouts.	Drew Pomeranz (6-4) was tagged for six runs and eight hits in 4 1/3 innings, snapping his career-best three-game winning streak. He fell behind 3-0 in the first.	"It's pretty frustrating," he said. "The runs in the first inning, I had trouble kind of getting my rhythm and timing down. But I went out there and tried to shut them down after that."	Hanley Ramirez had an RBI single and Dustin Pedroia a run-scoring double for Boston.	The first six innings took just over three hours, sending a large portion of fans streaming for the exits after the final out of the sixth.	Detroit lost the first two games of the series in the late innings, but didn't have any trouble after opening a big lead midway into this one.	Leading 3-2 in the fifth, the Tigers chased Pomeranz and scored five runs -- with Upton's homer off reliever Heath Hembree the big blow.	They loaded the bases on a throwing error by shortstop Xander Bogaerts, a single and walk before Upton hit his shot off the screen about halfway up the Pesky Pole. Ian Kinsler added an RBI single later in the inning.	"Felt like it was a chance to try to get a matchup," Boston manager John Farrell said of going to Hembree. "Didn't work out. The five runs ends up being quite a difference in this one tonight."	In the first, Detroit jumped ahead on Castellanos' shot over the Green Monster, a drive estimated at 448 feet, and Upton's RBI single.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: Farrell said RHP Carson Smith, recovering from Tommy John surgery last season, is scheduled to pitch off the mound against hitters again Tuesday. He looked sharp Saturday, getting mostly weak swings and grounders.	OOPS	Farrell tripped coming out of the dugout coming out to question a call in the ninth.	STILL A GOOD NIGHT	Bogaerts had three splendid plays despite his error, the best against Victor Martinez when he slid to his knees for a grounder in shallow center and fired to first.	HEADS UP	Tigers star Miguel Cabrera was signing autographs next to the dugout during BP when one fan tossed a ball from a few rows back to another, hoping to get his signed, too. It flew just over the head of the slugger, but he graciously signed it.	ROSTER MOVE	Detroit optioned RH reliever Arcenio Leon to Triple-A Toledo before the game and recalled LHP Chad Bell.	UP NEXT:	Tigers: Off Monday. RHP Buck Farmer (2-0, 0.00 ERA) looks to extend his season-opening, 13-inning scoreless stretch when they open a two-game interleague home series Tuesday against Arizona and RHP Zack Greinke (8-3, 3.20).	Red Sox: RHP Rick Porcello (3-8, 4.46) hopes to snap a personal three-game losing streak Monday when Boston hosts Philadelphia. RHP Jerad Eickoff (0-7, 5.15) goes for the Phillies.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

WASHINGTON --  After getting to Stephen Strasburg early, Tyler Flowers wouldn't let the Atlanta Braves squander the opportunity.	Flowers hit a go-ahead three-run home run off Matt Albers in the ninth inning and Atlanta came from three runs down to beat Washington 11-10 on Monday night.	"It was definitely one of those games where you could have rolled over a few times there, just as they could have, too" Flowers said. "Lot of big hits early and throughout the game."	Flowers had been hitless in his first four at-bats before he took Albers' fastball to the opposite field and into the Nationals bullpen for his fourth homer of the season.	Matt Adams hit a pair of homers. His first was one of three allowed by Strasburg over five uneven innings.	"That doesn't happen very often especially the way he's been pitching," Braves manager Brian Snitker said of Strasburg, who allowed two runs or fewer in four previous starts. "It happens though. Even to the best of them, they have games like that."	Adams' second homer scored the first of five runs allowed by Washington's relievers.	Albers (2-1) allowed the last three of those in the ninth to concede the Nationals 11th blown save and second during a four-game losing streak.	With closer Koda Glover going on the disabled list with a back injury Sunday, there is no obvious solution for a team that still comfortably leads the NL East.	"We've just got to keep grinding," said Albers of a relief unit that entered Monday with a 4.97 ERA. "Luckily we're doing well right now as a team. So we're just trying to pick up our end of the bargain. Try to go over each other. Just keep each other positive, really."	Atlanta's bullpen allowed two runs over 5 and 2/3 innings. Jason Motte (1-0) pitched a scoreless eighth and Jim Johnson allowed a run but completed the ninth for his 13th save.	Braves starter Mike Foltynewicz gave up a career-high eight runs and three homers, and lasted just 3 1/3 innings. He exited in the middle of a four-run fourth inning that gave Washington a 9-6 lead.	The Braves closed to 9-8 in the eighth on Adams' solo shot and Ender Inciarte's sacrifice fly. Then Nick Markakis and Adams both walked to bring up flowers, who worked the count to 2-0 before going with Albers' fastball.	"I thought I had a chance (at a home run)," Flowers said. "I know when other guys hit them, I don't know when I hit them."	HIT AND MISS	The Nationals lost despite pounding out 17 hits, including three each by Trea Turner, Brian Goodwin, Michael Taylor and Adam Lind. Turner, Goodwin and Bryce Harper all homered.	"We just came off a series where we didn't really swing the bats well, neither," said Nationals second baseman Daniel Murphy. "This is the ebbs and flows of the season."	DRAFT NIGHT	Braves: Selected RHP Kyle Wright out of Vanderbilt with the fifth overall pick of the 2017 amateur draft, which began Monday night.	Nationals: Took LHP Seth Romero out of the University of Houston with the 25th overall selection.	MOVES	Nationals: Recalled RHP Trevor Gott to Triple-A Syracuse and optioned INF Wilmer Difo to Syracuse. Gott made one appearance for the Nationals in 2016. He's 2-0 with a 3.30 ERA with Syracuse this season.	TRAINERS ROOM	Braves: RHP Bartolo Colon (oblique strain) threw a bullpen session Monday, and Snitker doesn't expect him to need a rehab start before returning from the disabled list. "We're going to bring him back with some sides and then plug him in probably early next week at some point in time," Snitker said.	Nationals: 1B Ryan Zimmerman (back) was out for a third straight game, though manager Dusty Baker hoped he would return Tuesday and then play "quite a few games until the next off day."	UP NEXT	Both of Tuesday's starters are coming off stellar outings last Thursday. Braves RHP R.A. Dickey (4-4, 4.73) allowed a run on three hits over seven innings in a 3-1 victory over Philadelphia. Nationals righty Joe Ross (3-2, 6.16) struck out a career-high 12 in 7 and 1/3 innings in a 6-1 win against Baltimore	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

PITTSBURGH -- Jameson Taillon pitched five scoreless innings in his return from treatments for testicular cancer and the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the Colorado Rockies 7-2 on Monday night.	Taillon (3-1) allowed five hits, walked two and struck out five. The 25-year-old had surgery May 8, four days after losing to the Reds at Cincinnati, then made three rehab starts in the minor leagues.	Josh Harrison hit a two-run home run, his eighth, in the first inning off Kyle Freeland (7-4). Harrison, David Freese and Jose Osuna each had two hits for the Pirates.	Freeland, a rookie, lost for the first time in seven road starts by giving up five runs (four earned) and nine hits in 5 2/3 innings. Freeland failed to pitch past the sixth inning for just the second time in his last 10 starts and allowed a home run in a sixth consecutive outing.	The NL West-leading Rockies dropped their second straight game following a seven-game winning streak. Pittsburgh won its third straight.	Freese hit an RBI double and scored on Andrew McCutchen's single in the third, extending the Pirates' lead to 4-0.	The Rockies got their first run in the sixth when Trevor Story broke an 0-for-15 skid with an RBI single, but the Pirates countered with a run in the sixth and two in the seventh to make it 7-2.	Colorado's Nolan Arenado had three hits, and DJ LeMahieu and Pat Valaika added two each.	BETTIS KNOWS	Rockies right-hander Chad Bettis is also recovering from testicular cancer. He spoke with Taillon on the phone last month and plans to visit with him before the three-game series ends Wednesday night.	"I guess it was meant to be for me to be here to see his first start back," Bettis said. "It's a very positive step forward for him and I'm very happy."	Bettis is also upbeat about his recovery. He rejoined the Rockies last week after his final round of chemotherapy in Phoenix and is currently throwing off flat ground from 120 feet.	BACK TO INDY	The Pirates optioned infielder Phil Gosselin to Triple-A Indianapolis to open a roster spot for Taillon, who was activated from the disabled list. Gosselin has hit .135 in 24 games during two stints with Pittsburgh this season.	UP NEXT	Rockies RHP Tyler Chatwood (6-7, 4.37 ERA) starts Tuesday night against RHP Gerrit Cole (3-6, 4.83). Chatwood has won both his starts in June, allowing two runs in 14 innings. Cole is 1/3 with a 10.73 ERA in his past four starts, giving up 23 runs and 39 hits in 19 1/3 innings.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

BOSTON --  Dustin Pedroia may have had to run a lot harder from his teammates than he did on his game-winning hit.	Pedroia singled home the winning run in the 11th inning to lift the Boston Red Sox to a 6-5 comeback win over the Philadelphia Phillies on Monday night.	Pablo Sandoval opened the inning with a single off Casey Fein (0-1). Deven Marrero pinch-ran and moved up on a sacrifice. After Mookie Betts was intentionally walked, Pedroia hit a ground single to right and Marrero beat the throw from Aaron Altherr with a headfirst slide on a close play.	After he turned first, Pedroia sprinted hard to foul territory just beyond the Red Sox dugout before his teammates caught him to celebrate.	"I saw some big guys coming at me and I'm like my first instincts were to get the heck out of the way," he said after his second career walk-off hit.	Pedroia's other game-ender came nearly seven years ago -- June 19, 2010 against the Los Angeles Dodgers.	The Red Sox go for another series victory against the Phillies when the two-game interleague set concludes Tuesday. Boston is 11-1-2 in its last 14 since 2004.	Hanley Ramirez had tied the game 5-5 in the eighth with a homer. Betts had four hits with three doubles and a single, and Andrew Benintendi also hit a solo homer for Boston, which has won three of four.	Tommy Joseph had a two-run single and former Red Sox Daniel Nava three hits for the Phillies, who have lost 10 of their last 12 games in Fenway Park.	"We played them tough, had chances to win," Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said.	Matt Barnes (5-2) pitched two scoreless innings of relief with five strikeouts.	"Tonight's a big team win," Red Sox manager John Farrell said. "So many guys chipping in, from a big night from Mookie at the top of the order, two critical and crucial innings by Matt Barnes after he's been worked fairly heavy of late. Panda (Sandoval) with a key base hit to lead off the final inning."	Philadelphia's Jerad Eickhoff remained winless after 13 starts, giving up four runs on seven hits in six innings. He was in line to get the win before Ramirez homered over the Green Monster off Joaquin Benoit. Cliff Lee was the last Phillies' pitcher start a season winless in his initial 13 starts, opening 2012.	"It was tough. I was trying to keep us in the game as best I could," Eickhoff said. "These guys did a really good job of getting us out to a good lead."	Eickhoff entered with the majors' lowest run support at 2.37 per game, but the Phillies took care of that right away, jumping ahead 4-0 in the first when Joseph's two-run single sparked the fast start.	Rick Porcello gave up five runs on 10 hits in six innings.	Boston rallied with a run in the second, two in third and one in the fourth. Benintendi hit his homer into the center-field bleachers in the second and had an RBI single the next inning.	Betts' third double of the game, a liner into the left-field corner, tied it.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: Triple-A prospect OF/SS Roman Quinn won't need surgery on his sprained left elbow after getting a second opinion by Dr. James Andrews.	Red Sox: Third baseman Sandoval's return to his starting position has been slowed since he missed a month with a sprained right knee. He didn't start for the third straight and has started eight since he was activated off the 10-day DL on May 30, batting just .185 with a homer.	ANNIVERSARY	Exactly seven-years ago Nava hit a grand slam on the first pitch of his first plate appearance while playing for the Red Sox in Fenway.	Signed as an amateur free agent by Boston in January 2008, he was part of its 2013 World Series championship team.	RUNNING WILD	Howie Kendrick had three stolen bases in the first five innings, matching his career high.	UP NEXT	Phillies: RHP Ben Lively (1-1, 2.57 ERA) makes his third major-league start Tuesday.	Red Sox: LHP David Price (1-1, 5.29) looks to rebound from a rough outing when he gave up six runs in five innings against the Yankees on Thursday.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

NEW YORK --  Jacob deGrom gave up a quick double to the wall, Asdrubal Cabrera made an early and embarrassing error.	Then in a hurry, things turned around for them and the New York Mets.	DeGrom pitched a five-hitter, Cabrera lined two home runs and turned four double plays, and the Mets beat the Chicago Cubs 6-1 Monday night.	"I think it all evens out," deGrom said.	DeGrom (5-3) threw the Mets' first complete game of the season, Jay Bruce also homered and New York won its fourth in a row.	Still under .500 but getting healthier, the Mets started a key two-week stretch where they face 14 straight games against teams that reached the NL playoffs last year.	The only damper on the win: Star outfielder Yoenis Cespedes exited because of a sore left heel, two days after he returned from a six-week stint on the disabled list.	Cespedes went 1 for 3 before being pulled. He had been out with a strained left hamstring, and also had been nagged by trouble with his quadriceps.	But Cespedes said there was nothing to worry about this time. He said the heel has bothered him for years, and that he expected to play Tuesday night.	"I'm just trying to be a little cautious," he said through a translator.	The Cubs dropped to 31-32 with their ninth straight road loss -- the World Series champions haven't won away from Wrigley Field in a month during their worst road skid since 2012.	"We can't keep using that as an excuse that the other team's pitcher is good," Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. "We've got to start beating some better pitchers, period. You don't get to the promised land without winning games like that, maybe 3-2, 4-3, whatever."	Addison Russell homered in Chicago's fifth loss in six games overall. The defeat began a string in which the Cubs play 17 of 20 on the road.	DeGrom pitched the Mets to their seventh win in a row over the Cubs at Citi Field, dating to the 2015 NL Championship Series. He neatly bounced back from getting hit hard in a pair of starts, walking four and striking out six.	DeGrom worked around a two-out double by Anthony Rizzo in the first and, effectively using a changeup, went on to throw his second complete game in 89 major league starts. After pitching the eighth, deGrom delivered a simple message to manager Terry Collins.	"I walked in and said I wanted to finish the game," deGrom said.	John Lackey (4-7) fell to 0-4 in five starts. He's allowed nine homers in 28 innings over the span and has yielded 19 longballs this season, one behind Cincinnati's Bronson Arroyo for most in the majors.	"I need to do a better job of keeping the ball in the yard, for sure, and give our offense a chance to score a couple of runs," Lackey said.	Cabrera got off to an ominous start with his 11th error, four more than the usually sure-handed shortstop made all of last year. Jason Heyward opened the Cubs second with a routine popup and Cabrera bumped into third baseman Jose Reyes as they settled under it, with the ball glancing off Cabrera's glove and falling to the ground.	"It's a tough game. Bad things happen, too," Cabrera said.	But Cabrera opened the bottom of the second by lining a drive over the right-center field fence. In the fourth, Cabrera did it again for his sixth home run this season and the sixth multihomer game of his career.	Cabrera was in the middle of double plays the Mets turned in four straight innings, starting in the third.	Bruce hit his 17th homer, a two-run drive in the third. He had three hits and drew a walk.	Russell homered for the second day in a row, connecting in the seventh.	REMEMBER HIM?	The Mets signed RHP Daniel Bard, and the reliever who turns 32 this month will report to the team's spring site in Port St. Lucie, Florida. Bard pitched 211 times for Boston from 2009-13, and spent parts of the last two seasons in the minors for St. Louis.	NO GAIN	A fan ran on the field in the eighth inning while the Cubs made a pitching change. The man headed toward center field, where a security guard made a firm tackle.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: RHP Kyle Hendricks (hand tendinitis) plans to throw on the side Tuesday. If all goes well, the team hopes he can come off the disabled list and start this weekend at Pittsburgh.	Mets: OF Michael Conforto was scratched with a stiff back and could miss one or two days.	UP NEXT	Cubs: LHP Jon Lester (3-4, 4.12 ERA) is 0-3 with 7.11 ERA in five road starts this year. In his previous start at Citi Field, last July 3, the Mets tagged him for eight earned runs in 1 1/3 innings.	Mets: RHP Zack Wheeler (3-3, 3.45) threw a career-high 120 pitches in his last start vs. the Cubs, back in 2014.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.	Jhoulys Chacín has agreed to a guaranteed $1.25 million, one-year contract with the Rockies.

CHICAGO --  Kevan Smith received a new shipment of bats on Monday. He may be sticking with the new lumber for some time.	Smith hit his first career home run, Avisail Garcia celebrated his 26th birthday with three RBI and the Chicago White Sox beat the Baltimore Orioles 10-7 on Monday night.	The White Sox opened a four-game series on a strong note after dropping nine of 11 and handed the Orioles their fifth straight loss.	Smith set the tone with a two-run drive in the second against Wade Miley (2-4) and finished with a career-best three RBI.	"It was the first swing of the game I took with it and I was like all right, let's order about three dozen of those," Smith said of his new bats. "But it just comes when you least expect it."	Garcia added an RBI double in a four-run third and drove in two more with a single in the fourth to give Chicago an 8-2 lead.	Matt Davidson had an RBI single and solo homer. Melky Cabrera had three of Chicago's 14 hits. Jose Abreu singled, doubled and scored twice.	"I think everybody stays very positive," White Sox manager Rick Renteria said of the big-hitting night. "I think people pick up on the energy that goes on when that happens."	Jake Petricka (1-0) pitched one-hit ball over 2 1/3 innings after Mike Pelfrey struggled, and the White Sox picked up the win after a 2-7 road trip.	Baltimore made a run late in the game, with Trey Mancini's three-run homer against Gregory Infante in the eighth cutting it to 10-6. But it wasn't enough after Miley failed to make it out of the third in his second straight start.	He gave up six runs and six hits in 2 1/3 innings. The left-hander lasted just 2 2/3 against Pittsburgh last week, and his ERA has jumped from 2.82 to 3.97 in his past two starts.	"I (stunk)," Miley said. "There's really no answer."	Pelfrey lasted 3 2/3 innings, allowing two runs and six hits while walking five. He also hit a batter. Pelfrey got out of a bases loaded jam in the third when Chris Davis hit a fly to right.	Davis then left the game with a strained right oblique and was scheduled for an MRI in Chicago on Tuesday morning, manager Buck Showalter said.	RARE TALENT?	The White Sox drafted Missouri State's Jake Burger with the No. 11 overall pick, adding a power-hitting third baseman to their pipeline.	A St. Louis area product, Burger hit .328 with 22 homers and 65 RBI as a junior this season and was the Missouri Valley Conference Player of the Year. Chicago sees him as a player with the potential to hit 25 to 30 homers and has no plans to move him off third base, scouting director Nick Hostetler said.	Burger said he tried to mold his game after Paul Konerko's. And he scored bonus points before his interview with Hostetler and scout Garrett Guest when he told them he grew up rooting for the White Sox.	The Orioles drafted LHP D.L. Hall from Georgia's Valdosta High with the No. 21 overall pick.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: 3B Manny Machado hit two singles after missing four games because of an injured left hand and wrist. . All-Star closer Zach Britton (strained left forearm) threw a 30-pitch bullpen session Monday in Sarasota, Fla. Because of uncertain weather in Sarasota, Britton is scheduled to throw in a live batting practice/simulated game situation Thursday at High-A Frederick. Britton remains on track to make a rehab start Monday at Short-A Aberdeen.	White Sox: RHP Nate Jones had a second MRI after symptoms of neuritis in his pitching elbow returned, putting his rehabilitation on hold. Jones did not accompany the White Sox on their nine-game trip to Detroit, Tampa Bay and Cleveland. ... OF Leury Garcia was to have X-rays after jamming his left middle finger twice on the bases at Cleveland on Sunday. Renteria was, however, encouraged that Garcia was able to squeeze things.	UP NEXT	Chicago and Baltimore send struggling starters to the mound with LHP Derek Holland (4-6, 3.99 ERA) starting for the White Sox and RHP Alec Asher (2-4, 4.35) going for the Orioles. Holland is 0-3 with a 10.38 ERA in his past three starts. Asher hasn't been much better in that stretch, going 1-2 with a 9.49 ERA.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

HOUSTON --  Yu Darvish was determined to pitch better Monday night after struggling in his last outing against the Houston Astros.	The right-hander was able to do that, pitching seven solid innings to help the Texas Rangers beat their in-state rival 6-1.	Darvish (6-4) allowed a season-low one hit with one run and three walks. He induced a season-best 12 groundball outs. This start came after he tied a season-worst by allowing seven hits with three runs in just five innings in a 7-1 loss to Houston on June 2.	"It was a great night for Yu," Texas manager Jeff Banister said. "His sinker played very well to both sides of the plate. He was able to run the four-seam up and down to left-handers. Curveball showed up big for him early; didn't break out the slider until the sixth, which allowed him to get some late outs."	Darvish said his sinker was the key to his success Monday.	"I usually stay with my strength and I go with my stuff, what I've got on the day," he said through a translator. "But (after) that previous outing ... I just studied hard on each hitter and what their tendencies are and I went at it today."	The Rangers went up 2-0 on back-to-back triples by Rougned Odor and Joey Gallo in the third inning.	The Astros got an RBI single by Alex Bregman in the fifth, but a run-scoring double by Adrian Beltre gave the Rangers some insurance in the sixth inning.	Nomar Mazara provided more cushion with his three-run shot to straightaway center field off Dayan Diaz with two outs in the eighth to make it 6-1.	Houston starter Joe Musgrove (4-5) allowed five hits and two runs in 4 2/3 innings in his return from the disabled list. Musgrove had been out since May 26 with shoulder discomfort.	"He was good," manager A.J. Hinch said. "We were very cautious with his pitch count, obviously. Seventy five was as high as we wanted to go, so I went out to get him."	Jonathan Lucroy singled with two outs in the second inning and scored on the triple by Odor to put Texas up 1-0. Gallo followed with his triple to score Odor, but was tagged out at home to end the inning.	Right fielder Josh Reddick crashed into the wall trying to make a catch on the ball hit by Gallo and was taken out of the game to start the fourth inning. He was diagnosed with a mild concussion.	Darvish kept the Astros off-balance all night. He retired the first seven before walking Bregman with one out in the third. Nori Aoki grounded into a force out that left Bregman out at second before Darvish retired George Springer to end that inning.	Carlos Beltran drew a walk to start the fifth, before the RBI single by Bregman which cut the lead to 2-1 with two outs in the inning. Bregman's hit sailed into shallow left field, and Mazara charged in but was unable to make the catch.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: CF Carlos Gomez (right hamstring) is nearing a rehab assignment and will likely play three games in the minors before he returns to the team.	Astros: RHP Lance McCullers was placed on the 10-day disabled list retroactive to June 9 with discomfort in his lower back. The move leaves Houston with four starting pitchers on the DL as ace Dallas Keuchel and Charlie Morton are on the 10-day DL and Collin McHugh is on the 60-day DL. The Astros don't think the injury to McCullers is serious and expect him to return as soon as the 10 days are up.	2K AOKI	The Astros honored Aoki a day after he surpassed the 2,000-hit mark between the American and Japanese major leagues. The milestone earned him automatic entrance into Meikyukai -- also known as The Golden Players Club -- one of two Japanese baseball halls of fame.	Aoki was presented with a black cowboy hat and a shadow box commemorating his milestone in a pregame ceremony.	He has 1,284 hits in Japan and 717 in the majors.	HOMER STREAK SNAPPED	The Astros failed to hit a home run on Monday to snap their franchise-record 19-game streak with at least one home run.	UP NEXT	Rangers: Texas will start Nick Martinez (1-3, 4.88) on Tuesday. Martinez allowed one hit in 3 1/3 scoreless innings of relief in his last outing.	Astros: Brad Peacock (3-1, 3.15) will start on Tuesday on three days' rest in place of McCullers. Peacock exited his last start after just three innings after allowing seven hits, four walks and four runs in a 9-4 loss to the Angels on Friday.	---	More AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Aaron Judge realized he hadn't done much to impress his parents, who were in the Big A stands for his first game of the season in his home state.	He struck out twice early, and he airmailed a throw to the plate that allowed a run to score during the Angels' tying rally.	With one majestic swing in the eighth inning, the rookie made a happy memory for Patty and Wayne Judge -- along with the other thousands of roaring Yankees fans in the Orange County stands.	Judge hit a tiebreaking two-run homer in the eighth to lead New York to its sixth consecutive victory, 5-3 over Los Angeles on Monday night.	One day after hitting a 495-foot homer in the Bronx, Judge hit an emphatic 438-foot shot on the opposite coast for his fourth homer in three games and the 22nd of his belief-defying season. Judge's parents made the trip down from central California to watch their son's latest feat in the opener of the Yankees' seven-game Golden State road trip.	"Yeah, didn't start off too well, with two K's, but that's baseball," Judge said with a grin. "You never know what's going to happen."	The Fresno State product's first big league homer in California thrilled a road crowd that was loaded with supporters of the AL East leaders. They rained down repeated chants of "M-V-P!" on the rookie leading their team's revival after just one playoff appearance in the past four years.	"There's a ton of excitement around this kid," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "We know what he's done is special. ... It was really good to hear (so many fans). He's a big part of it. The winning is a big part of it."	Didi Gregorius went 4 for 4 with a walk and drove in two runs for the Yankees, while Chase Headley added an RBI single.	Danny Espinosa and Cameron Maybin got back-to-back RBI hits in the seventh for the Angels.	Jose Alvarez (0-3) gave up Aaron Hicks' one-out double before Judge's homer.	Dellin Betances struck out the side in the ninth for his sixth save, his first since May 27.	BIG DECISION	Angels manager Mike Scioscia curiously allowed closer Bud Norris to pitch to Judge with first base open, and the AL homers leader made him pay. Scioscia said he hoped Norris would pitch cautiously around Judge, knowing he had a base open.	"Obviously, you tip your cap," Scioscia said. "He hit it a long way."	DIDI'S DAY	Gregorius extended his career-best hitting streak to 14 games with three straight singles off Alex Meyer in the first five innings. His four hits tied his career high.	TANAKA'S REBOUND	Masahiro Tanaka snapped his five-start losing streak while pitching four-hit ball into the seventh inning. After his recent run of ugly defeats, Tanaka's start was pushed back one day to the road trip opener, partly so he could face the Angels' unintimidating lineup.	"It's good to get an extra recovery day, but I was ready to go (Sunday)," Tanaka said through a translator.	The Japanese right-hander largely shut down the Angels after Kole Calhoun's first-inning homer, but he yielded Espinosa's two-out RBI single before reliever Tyler Clippard (1-3) gave up Maybin's tying RBI double in the seventh. Both runs were unearned in a rally aided by Headley's one-out error on Eric Young Jr.'s grounder.	BIG ON BIG	The 6-foot-9 Meyer struck out the 6-foot-7 Judge twice, but also yielded five singles and five walks while failing to get out of the fifth inning. Still, Meyer hasn't allowed more than two runs in a home start this season.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: C Gary Sanchez got the night off despite going 9 for 21 in his previous five games.	Angels: Reliever Cam Bedrosian will make a rehab appearance at Class A Inland Empire this week in his return from a groin injury that has kept him out for nearly two weeks.	UP NEXT	Yankees: CC Sabathia (7-2, 3.66 ERA) has won five consecutive starts, all of them coming after a New York loss. The Northern California native has a career 4.03 ERA at the Big A.	Angels: J.C. Ramirez (6-4, 6.55 ERA) got another win last week despite yielding a career-high 10 hits to the Tigers. Los Angeles has won seven of the converted reliever's last nine starts.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

SAN DIEGO --  Franchy Cordero got his big chance last month when three San Diego Padres outfielders went down with injuries.	Cordero, who made his major league debut on May 27, has responded with several good performances, none bigger than in a 9-3 victory Monday night against the Cincinnati Reds.	The rookie hit his first major league home run as part of a six-run second inning that also included Yangervis Solarte's sixth home run.	Cordero doubled in his next at-bat for his fifth multihit showing in 15 games, and made a diving catch in center field.	"He's here quicker than expected," manager Andy Green said, "but he's shown he deserves to be here. He belongs here. He had a great game."	Austin Hedges had three hits and three RBI, and starter Luis Perdomo (1-3) helped San Diego win for just the second time in nine games.	Reds pitcher Bronson Arroyo (3-5) had allowed a major league-high 20 home runs entering Monday and took in a 6.25 ERA. Arroyo lasted 4 2/3 innings and allowed two home runs and nine runs. The 13 hits given up tied his career high set Sept. 26, 2008, at St. Louis.	"These guys were just all over me tonight," he said of the Padres. "It looked like they knew what was coming half the time."	Arroyo, whose ERA is 7.01, acknowledged that he needs to pitch better.	"I've got to catch a streak here where I can put two or three good quality outings together," he said. "If not, I'm sure there's going to come the time when someone's going to take my spot if I don't get it done."	Cordero, 22, drove an 84-mph fastball from Arroyo, 40, over the left field wall for two runs.	Solarte followed an out later with a bases-empty blow that staked Perdomo to a 7-2 lead.	Cordero was promoted from Triple-A as the replacement to Manuel Margot, who is expected to return this month from a calf injury.	He is in his second season in center field after high error totals moved him off shortstop.	"You have to have faith in yourself and believe things are going to happen," Cordero said through a translator.	Perdomo allowed two first-inning runs that Green attributed to subpar defensive plays by two teammates.	From there, Perdomo allowed one run before departing with two outs in the seventh.	"I felt I had more confidence attacking hitters," Perdomo said.	He kept the Reds from adding to their National League-best home run total, allowing seven hits and two walks in all.	He said he benefited from moving to the center of the rubber during a recent bullpen session.	"He got that lead and he ran with it, fastball and slider for strikes, pounded the zone," Reds manager Bryan Price said.	The Reds, who are 0-4 on a six-game West Coast trip, saw their majors-worst starting ERA go from 5.84 to 6.01.	Providing a slapstick moment, all four Reds infielders allowed a popup to land behind the pitcher's mound -- giving Hedges a single in the third inning.	The lopsided score allowed Price to hold out shortstop Zack Cozart for the final four innings. An All-Star candidate who brought in a .329 batting average and nine home runs, Cozart has been dealing with a thigh injury for several months.	DRAFT MEMORY	Green said he's certain he wouldn't be in big leagues if not for the Arizona Diamondbacks drafting him in 2000 in the 24th round.	"I was on a golf course in Lexington, Kentucky, when they called," Green said. "I was surprised. I didn't even really imagine a future in the game."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: LHP Amir Garrett threw in the bullpen Sunday and is expected to come off the disabled list in time to start against the Padres on Wednesday.	Padres: RHP Trevor Cahill, sidelined since mid-May by a shoulder injury, is close to resuming bullpen sessions, Green said.	UP NEXT	Reds: RHP Scott Feldman (5-4, 4.09) is coming off seven-inning, scoreless performance Thursday against the St. Louis Cardinals.	Padres: LHP Clayton Richard (4-7, 4.54) has induced the most groundballs in the National League, and his groundball rate is also the league's highest.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ST. LOUIS -- Playing time in the Cardinals' outfield has been hard to come by for Jose Martinez lately. He earned some more Tuesday afternoon.	Martinez hit two solo homers, and St. Louis beat the Milwaukee Brewers 6-0 in the opener of a day-night doubleheader.	What made the day even better for Martinez was that his feat occurred with his mom watching him play in the majors for the first time.	"It's a really special day for me ... because my mom is watching," Martinez said of his mother, who is visiting from Venezuela. "For me, everything I do is for her. It's a great day today because she's going to be happy, for sure."	Martinez connected in the fifth and eighth innings for his first multihomer game. He added a sacrifice fly in the sixth inning.	"He's doing a nice job, even in the outfield," Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said. "He's doing everything we ask; and you talk about dangerous hitters, I think you can count him in that category."	Martinez had registered just one at-bat since June 7 entering the game. The 28-year-old had finally earned regular playing time earlier this season, before a groin injury sidelined him for three weeks. Since then, Dexter Fowler, Tommy Pham and Stephen Piscotty have solidified the Cardinals' outfield.	"When you're not playing, you've got to be ready for every opportunity," Martinez said. "Everything is mental. You've got to be mentally prepared 100 percent and try to make something happen every time and not try to do too much."	Martinez's 415-foot opposite field drive to right-center ignited a three-run Cardinals rally in the fifth. Matt Carpenter followed with an RBI double and scored on Fowler's single to make it 3-0.	Kolten Wong had an RBI double as the Cardinals extended their lead to 5-0 in the sixth.	Martinez's homer to left in the eighth traveled 436 feet.	"You never know what's going to happen tomorrow, and that's the deal for me," Martinez said. "You've got to go out there and do your best."	Right-hander Lance Lynn (5-3) struggled with his control with four walks, but he was able to get out of a bases-loaded, one-out jam in the fifth. Lynn struck out eight, including the side in the fourth inning.	"They put together some good at-bats," Lynn said. "There wasn't too many hard hit balls, either. I had good stuff; I was just missing here and there at times."	John Brebbia pitched a perfect sixth inning and Tyler Lyons pitched the final three innings to earn his first career save. The Cardinals' bullpen allowed three hits in four innings.	Lefty Brent Suter, recalled from Triple-A Colorado Springs as the Brewers' 26th man for the doubleheader, got the surprise start after right-hander Brandon Woodruff had his major league debut postponed during warm-ups because of right hamstring soreness.	Suter (0-1) started with four innings of one-hit ball, before running into trouble in the fifth. He also recorded his first major league hit with a single to left in the top of the fifth inning.	"I was surprised, to say the least," Suter said. "I was in there eating crackers getting ready for the game and got the call, 'Hey, Sute.' I thought it was like bad news or something. I thought something happened. It turns out it kind of was bad news Woody went down. But 25 minutes later, I'm starting at Busch Stadium."	MILESTONE	Chad Huffman recorded his first major league extra base hit with a triple in the Cardinals' three-run fifth. It was his first hit since June 27, 2010, marking the eighth-longest streak between hits since 2000.	MISSED OPPORTUNITIES	The Brewers couldn't capitalize on Lynn's lack of command, stranding seven runners in the first five innings. Hernan Perez popped to shallow center in the fifth after a walk had loaded the bases with one out in the fifth, and Travis Shaw flied out to center to leave the bases loaded.	PROUD GRANDPA	The Cardinals announced that Ryker James was born Tuesday morning to Tate and Margaret Matheny, making manager Mike Matheny a grandfather for the first time.	TRAINING ROOM	Brewers: 3B Shaw (family medical emergency) was reinstated. RHP Rob Scahill was designated for assignment. And OF Brett Phillips was optioned to Colorado Springs.	Cardinals: RHP Sam Tuivailala was recalled from Triple-A Memphis, INF Jhonny Peralta was given his unconditional release and INF Paul DeJong was optioned to Memphis.	UP NEXT	Brewers: RHP Jimmy Nelson (4-3, 3.45 ERA) has won his past two decisions. He is 0-8 with a 7.09 ERA in 10 appearances against St. Louis.	Cardinals: LHP Marco Gonzales (debut) was recalled from Memphis to make his first start since Sept. 1, 2015, after missing all of 2016 after Tommy John surgery.	Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

WASHINGTON --  All the Washington Nationals needed to escape a four-game slide Tuesday night was slugger Ryan Zimmerman.	Zimmerman returned from back soreness to hit his 18th and 19th homers and tie a career franchise record, and the Nationals scored five runs in the sixth inning off R.A. Dickey to end their skid with a 10-5 victory over the Atlanta Braves.	"It happens, man," Zimmerman said. "I wish we wouldn't go through stretches like that, but every team is going to go through them, and that's why we play as many games as we do."	Zimmerman went 3 for 4 in his first action since Friday.	His second blast that gave Washington a 6-5 lead was his 234th with Washington, tying Vladimir Guerrero for the Nationals/Expos franchise record.	He entered Tuesday one off the NL home run lead.	Daniel Murphy homered, doubled and had three hits and two RBI as the NL-East leading Nationals scored eight runs against a second Braves starter in as many nights.	Unlike Monday, Washington's bullpen held firm with four relievers combining for 3 1/3 scoreless innings, beginning when Trevor Gott (1-0) worked out of the sixth.	Dickey (4-5) went five-plus innings. After allowing one run in his previous start, the knuckleballer let in his most runs since April 24, 2015.	"The guys were coming in and saying `That's a stupid knuckleball he had going," Braves manager Brian Snitker said. "Then went out in the sixth and lost it. It's one of those feel things all the time."	Atlanta's Rio Ruiz hit a two-run homer, and Dansby Swanson and Brandon Phillips had three hits each for the Braves.	After allowing three runs in the first, Dickey retired 13 of 14 batters and held a 5-3 lead when the Braves scored three runs in the sixth to chase Joe Ross.	Then his disastrous bottom half of the inning began.	Bryce Harper singled in a run and came home on Zimmerman's arcing blast over the visitor's bullpen.	Zimmerman is 14 for 39 (.359) with four career homers off the 2012 Cy Young winner.	"I just go up there and literally see the ball and try to hit the ball," Zimmerman said. "I think when you start thinking about it too much, that's when you get into trouble."	There were still no outs when Dickey hit Anthony Rendon with his 80th and final pitch to put two aboard. Matt Wieters followed with a two-run double off reliever Luke Jackson to make it 8-5.	"The last two outings, I've felt really good and my results tonight were very pedestrian," said Dickey, who saw his ERA rise to 5.35. "I'm close to turning the page here and not being mediocre."	NOT GIVING A SHIFT	Murphy and second base umpire Alan Porter appeared to have a terse exchange during the second inning.	"Murphy had asked him to move because he didn't want to get blocked if a ball was hit to his right," Nationals manager Dusty Baker said. "For some reason he refused to move. I don't understand it. I'm sure he had a reason, but he didn't give that reason to Murph."	PLAYING IT SAFE	Zimmerman said he could have played Monday, but after enduring prolonged injury absences in each of the past three seasons, understood Baker waiting a day more.	"That was more the thought, just to be careful," Zimmerman said. "That's his job. All of us want to play every day. But he realizes we have 3 1/2 more months to go. . I think it was a smart move."	TRAINERS ROOM	Braves: 1B Matt Adams has flourished filling for 1B Freddie Freeman (left wrist fracture). Since joining Atlanta from St. Louis on May 20, Adams has hit eight of his nine home runs and driven in 19 of his 26 RBI. He was 2 for 5 on Tuesday.	Nationals: LHP Sammy Solis (left elbow) was expected to pitch a simulated game in Florida on Tuesday. The Nationals plan to decide whether he goes on a rehab assignment afterward.	UP NEXT	Braves RHP Julio Teheran (5-4, 5.08) looks to build on his last start (6 IP, 1 ER) as Atlanta wraps up its first trip of the season to Washington against Nationals RHP Tanner Roark (6-3, 3.87).	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PITTSBURGH --  The first two months of the season were a mess for Andrew McCutchen and John Jaso, a mish-mash of strikeouts and missed opportunities.	A change of scenery appears to have done more than a bit of good for both. The rest of the Pittsburgh Pirates, too.	Jaso drilled a pinch-hit two-run homer off Colorado's Adam Ottavino (0-1) in the seventh inning to break a tie and the resurgent McCutchen went deep twice as the Pirates pulled away from the Rockies late in a 5-2 victory Tuesday night.	"I know that nerves can get in there and adrenaline, so just keep that calm and it becomes another at-bat like you started the game," said Jaso, who is now primarily coming off the bench after splitting time between first base and the outfield earlier in the year.	Jaso improved to 6 of 9 with two home runs and seven RBI in his last nine appearances as a pinch-hitter when he took a 1-0 pitch from Ottavino and bounced it off the fence in center field to put the Pirates ahead to stay.  McCutchen provided some insurance with a two-run shot off Jordan Lyles in the eighth for his second home run of the game and the 13th multi-homer game of his career.	"I'm not trying to hit home runs, just put a good swing on the ball," McCutchen said.	McCutchen is hitting .396 with four home runs and 13 RBI since being dropped from third to sixth in the batting order on May 26 to raise his batting average from .206 to .255. Pirates manager Clint Hurdle has no immediate plans on returning McCutchen to his customary spot in the three-hole.	"I don't have any concept on why we would move him right now based on the way he's swinging right now," Hurdle said. "Just leave him alone. "	Gerrit Cole (4-6) broke out of a funk to allow just one run in seven strong innings . Pittsburgh's ace came in with an 8.84 ERA in his previous four starts but allowed just three hits, striking out three and walking three. The Pirates have won a season-high four straight following a four-game losing streak that dropped them to last in the NL Central.	Tony Wolters had two hits and an RBI for the Rockies. Trevor Story drove in a run and scored for Colorado. The NL West-leading Rockies have dropped three consecutive games for the first time this season.  Colorado arrived in Pittsburgh with the most road victories in the majors (24) but their offense has gone quiet at PNC Park while managing three runs combined in back-to-back losses.	"It was kind of tough tonight," Story said. "(Cole) has electric stuff. You know it's gonna be a battle against guys like that."	Tyler Chatwood matched Cole for six innings, his lone mistake a pitch McCutchen sent into the left field stands in the fourth. Chatwood allowed six hits, struck out five and walked one and has a 1.00 ERA in his last four road starts.	LORD STANLEY VISITS	Captain Sidney Crosby and several other members of the Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins stopped by PNC Park before the game and they brought the Cup with them. The Penguins set up the Cup in the Pirates clubhouse before the first pitch while players from both teams grabbed a quick celebratory photo.	The Penguins, including Crosby, Phil Kessel, Marc-Andre Fleury, Patric Hornqvist and Jake Guentzel, were saluted by the crowd before Crosby threw out the first pitch, a strike to teammate Ron Hainsey.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rockies: LF Gerardo Parra's strained right quadriceps is worse than the team originally thought. Manager Bud Black said Parra, who went on the DL on June 7, will be out longer than anticipated. ... RHP Tyler Anderson (left knee inflammation) threw 52 pitches in a bullpen session on Monday. The team will wait until Wednesday before making a decision on when and where Anderson will make a rehab start. ... RHP Jon Gray (stress fracture left foot) will make a rehab start for Class-A Asheville on Wednesday.	Pirates: Cs Francisco Cervelli (concussion) and Chris Stewart (strained left hamstring) both threw and hit on Tuesday. Cervelli is eligible to come off the DL on Wednesday.	UP NEXT	Rockies: German Marquez (4-3, 4.44 ERA) will try to bounce back from his shortest start of the season when he faces the Pirates for the first time in his career on Wednesday. Marquez went just three innings against the Chicago Cubs last Friday, though Colorado rallied to win 5-3.	Pirates: Chad Kuhl (1-5, 5.63) looks for his first win in over two months on Wednesday. Kuhl hasn't gone longer than five innings in any of his last nine starts.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

TORONTO --  For a rookie pitcher making his second career start, it was no surprise that nerves were a factor for Jake Faria.	Not that he showed many in building on his major-league debut last week with his second straight victory in an 8-1 Tampa Bay Rays win over the Toronto Blue Jays on Tuesday night.	Faria (2-0) became the third Ray all-time to win his first two career games, joining Jeremy Hellickson and Joe Kennedy, as Tampa registered its sixth victory in its last seven games.	"Sometimes I feel (nervous) a little bit and then everyone's like `You didn't show anything." he said. "I think my face is just frozen when I'm out there. I don't know what happens."	The 23-year-old right-hander held the Blue Jays to six hits in 6 1/3 innings, striking out eight and giving up one run. After being sent down after shutting down the Chicago White Sox last Wednesday in a 3-1 victory, he was called up on Monday to replace Matt Andriese, who went on the disabled list with a hip complaint.	Faria's performance, especially on the occasions when he got behind in the count, showed a lot of poise for a 23-year-old, leaving manager Kevin Cash to comment on his ability to shut out any distractions.	"It doesn't seem like he gets overly amped on anything and that's the sign of a pitcher that's in control and that's what he showed," Cash said.	He was backed by an offense that produced 16 hits, just two shy of the season high, with every member of the Rays getting at least one. Corey Dickerson led the way, going 4 of 5 as he registered his 15th home run of the season, a solo shot in the ninth inning.	Taylor Featherston's first home run of the season and Logan Morrison's 18th got Tampa rolling in a bat-around third inning against Toronto starter Marco Estrada (4-5), who suffered his sixth straight loss against Tampa.	"We've done a pretty good job against him this year," Morrison said. "I think it's just one of those things."	Estrada (4-5) had his shortest outing of the season, lasting just 3 1/3 innings after giving up 12 hits and being charged with six runs in his sixth straight loss to Tampa. Over his last three starts, the Toronto left-hander is now 0-3 with a 12.07 ERA.	"It sucks," Estrada said. "I know I've been in a bit of a funk the last few outings but I'm not worried about it. I felt pretty good out there. I know things are going to change for me."	CENTURY SPRINT	Featherston's home run marked the earliest that the Rays have reached 100 home runs in a season, coming in just the 67th game, surpassing last season's club record of 68 games.	YOUTH MOVEMENT	Tuesday's game marked the 464th consecutive Rays game started by a pitcher under the age of 30, the longest current streak in the majors. 35-year-old Erik Bedard on July 3, 2014, was the last pitcher 30 years or older to start for Tampa.	TAKING FLIGHT	Daniel Robertson's bat sailed out of his hands as he swung and missed in the fifth inning, but after bouncing off the top of the Blue Jays' dugout it landed safely in the hands of a fan.	WINGING IT	Toronto Maple Leafs winger Mitch Marner threw out the first pitch on Tuesday night. Marner, who had 19 goals and 42 assists in his recently completed rookie campaign, successfully completed his throw to Blue Jays right-hander Marcus Stroman, who promptly autographed the ball for the young hockey star.	FAMILY TIES	Almost 20 years since Roger Clemens last suited up for them, the Blue Jays drafted his son, Kacy, in the eighth round of the MLB draft on Tuesday. Clemens, a first baseman, was the offensive MVP for the University of Texas in his senior season.	Roger Clemens won back-to-back Cy Young Awards in his two seasons with the Blue Jays from 1997-98.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: SS/2B Tim Beckham sat out Tuesday's game with a sore knee. Manager Kevin Cash said Beckham was being rested and the team would see how he felt on Wednesday. . C Wilson Ramos joined Triple-A Durham on a rehab assignment in his continued quest to come back from a torn knee ligament.	Blue Jays: OF Steve Pearce has been moved to Triple-A as he continues his rehab assignment from a calf strain. Pearce has been on the disabled list since May 15. . RHP Aaron Sanchez is due to begin throwing off a mound in the next couple of days, according to Jays manager John Gibbons. Sanchez suffered a finger laceration and was placed on the DL on May 20.	UP NEXT	Rays: RHP Jake Odorizzi (4-3, 3.59 ERA) has allowed a home run in eight consecutive starts, tied for the second-longest active streak in the majors.	Blue Jays: LHP Francisco Liriano (3-2, 5.87) makes his fourth start of the season against Tampa Bay, looking to improve to 2-0 against Toronto's AL East division rival.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

BOSTON --  Even 22-year-old Andrew Benintendi was getting weary.	Boston's young outfielder put an end to yet another marathon game and a string of failed chances with a single in the 12th inning, driving in Xander Bogaerts from third for the winning run as the Red Sox outlasted the Philadelphia Phillies 4-3 on Tuesday night.	"We've played some long games on consecutive days. I was trying not to overthink it and just hit the ball," Benintendi said.	It was the first career walkoff for Benintendi, who went 3 for 5 and made a key defensive play in the eighth that kept Philadelphia from taking the lead. After leaving runners stranded in the 10th and 11th, it was Benintendi who got it done before the night got any later.	Mitch Moreland hit one homer and barely missed another in the 12th with a long single off the Green Monster, allowing Bogaerts to advance to third and set up Benintendi's game-winner. The ball bounced over the short wall in right, but was officially still a single.	It didn't matter much as the Red Sox beat the Phillies in extra innings for the second straight night, extending Philadelphia's losing streak to seven straight.	"A number of missed opportunities offensively. Finally, Benny gets the big hit to finish it," Boston manager John Farrell said.	Fernando Abad (2-0) pitched the 11th and 12th for Boston, which blew great opportunities in the first two extra innings before finally cashing in after Louis Garcia (1-1) walked Bogaerts with one out in the 12th.	Boston left 12 runners on base and was just 2 for 12 with runners in scoring position until Benintendi finally put an end to it, then got doused with an ice bucket in front of the Boston dugout.	Aaron Altherr hit a two-run homer for the Phillies, who rallied from a 3-0 deficit and also had some late opportunities to take the lead near the end.	"We played these guys tough. They can't say we were a pushover," Philadelphia manager Pete Mackanin said.	Ben Lively pitched seven solid innings in his third career start, digging himself out of some early trouble and holding Boston to three runs and eight hits. He walked two, struck out two and hit a batter but did not allow a run after Moreland's solo homer to center in the third put Boston up 3-2.	"Lively showed a lot of guts. He got hit around early but then he didn't shy away," Mackanin said. "He didn't start nitpicking, he wasn't afraid to throw strikes, came right after the hitters. Very impressive."	David Price made his home debut for the Red Sox and needed just six pitches to put the Phillies down in the first. But the Phillies forced him to throw 36 pitches in the second inning when Philadelphia loaded the bases with one out. The Phillies didn't score until the third when Altherr drove a pitch from Price all the way out of the ballpark, clearing the Green Monster and signs above it to tie it at 2-all.	After Moreland put Boston back up with his ninth homer of the season, Philadelphia tied it in the sixth when Michael Saunders ran out a fielder's choice, just avoiding a double play and allowing Tommy Joseph to score. Joseph reached on a ground-rule double to right off Price with one out.	The Red Sox loaded the bases with one out in the first but only got one run out of it. After walking Benintendi with the bases loaded to put Boston up 1-0, Lively got out of the early jam when Hanley Ramirez grounded into a double play. Boston got another run in the second when Jackie Bradley Jr. led off with a double and scored on a double by Christian Vazquez.	Price pitched six innings, allowing three runs, four hits and four walks, striking out six.	HOLD UP	Benintendi had the game-winning hit and may just have prevented the winning run from crossing the plate in the eighth. Benintendi threw out Howie Kendrick at home as he tried to score from first when Maikel Franco hit a line drive off the Green Monster in left.	Benintendi's throw to Vazquez at home was on target and the score remained tied.	"I was kind of surprised by them sending him," Benintendi said. "It was kind of a weird situation because I knew how much time I had and I didn't want to throw one off line so it kind of felt like a lob. I just tried to throw a strike to Vazky and he put a good tag on him."	BIG BEN	Although he didn't figure in the decision, Lively became the first Phillies pitcher to allow three earned runs or fewer in his first three career games since Bill Champion in 1969.	"It's nice but it's always better to win," Lively said. "I felt like if I was a little bit more settled in early in the game it could've been a different outcome tonight."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: 2B Cesar Hernandez will require six weeks to recover from an abdominal strain on his left side, Mackanin said before the game. Hernandez hurt himself while making a throw Friday against the Cardinals. ... Kendrick started at second Tuesday night. ... Philadelphia traded LHP Joely Rodriguez to Texas earlier Tuesday for a player to be named or cash.	Red Sox: Ramirez will sit out when the Red Sox head to Philadelphia for the next two games. Farrell said the Red Sox will stick with Moreland at first base rather than have Ramirez take the field with the Phillies scheduled to start right-handed pitchers Wednesday and Thursday.	UP NEXT	Red Sox: LHP Brian Johnson (2-0, 3.44 ERA) gets his fourth start of the season and fifth of his career. Coming off a complete game shutout May 27 against Seattle, Johnson didn't figure in the decision Friday when he pitched 4 1/3 innings against Detroit.	Phillies: RHP Jeremy Hellickson (5-4, 4.50) is the only Philadelphia pitcher with a winning record despite going winless in his last five starts.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CLEVELAND -- Clayton Kershaw wasn't at his best but still extended his unbeaten string.	Cody Bellinger continued his outstanding rookie season with two home runs, including a tiebreaking shot in the eighth inning off Andrew Miller.	Kershaw and Bellinger combined to lead the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 7-5 win over the Indians on Tuesday night.	Kershaw (9-2) allowed two runs in seven innings. He has not lost in his past eight starts. The left-hander gave up a run in the third on Michael Brantley's single and a leadoff homer to Roberto Perez in the fifth that tied the game.	The three-time Cy Young Award winner yielded six hits, struck out four and walked two while throwing 101 pitches. He is 5-0 with a 1.94 ERA since his most recent defeat on May 1.	"Tonight was not a great night for me," Kershaw said. "My fastball was pretty erratic, and I was falling behind hitters."	Indians manager Terry Francona did not meet with reporters after the game because he wasn't feeling well, a team spokesman said. Bench coach Brad Mills took questions in his place. Francona left the dugout in the ninth inning but was still at the ballpark, the spokesman said.	Mills had no further information about Francona, who missed a game in Washington last season because of an illness but returned to the dugout the following day.	Dodgers outfielder Yasiel Puig made an obscene gesture at Cleveland fans after hitting a home run in the second inning. After crossing home plate, he raised both middle fingers in the direction of fans seated in the dugout suites located on field level.	Puig said he was heckled in the on-deck circle, which is directly in front of those choice seats.	"People were talking to me before the home run, and they talked to me after the home run," he said through a translator. "I stooped to their level. It happened suddenly. It came out. There's nothing I can do about it. There were about four of them. They were pretty close there."	Puig realizes he could face a fine from Major League Baseball for his actions.	"If I get fined, I can't not pay it. I know I did it," he said.	Bellinger led off the eighth with a towering drive into the right-field seats off Miller (3-1). The home run was the first that Cleveland's dominant left-hander has allowed in 33 innings this season.	Bellinger added a three-run drive in the ninth off Boone Logan, becoming the third rookie in Dodgers history to have four multihomer games.	Daniel Robertson hit his first major league home run for Cleveland with two outs in the ninth, a three-run shot off Chris Hatcher.	Kenley Jansen struck out Jason Kipnis for his 12th save.	Indians starter Trevor Bauer allowed two runs in 5⅔ innings. He was removed with the bases loaded, and Miller -- appearing in the sixth inning for the second straight game -- struck out Puig to end the threat.	Miller retired the side in order in the seventh, but he gave up just his third run of the season when Bellinger homered.	Perez's home run was his first since he homered twice in Game 1 of the World Series against the Chicago Cubs. He hadn't homered in the regular season since Sept. 26.	LEFTY-LEFTY MATCHUP	Bellinger got a lot of advice from teammates before the game about facing Miller. The first baseman obviously listened well.	"He's one of the best relievers in the game and is super deceptive," Bellinger said.	Miller took full blame for the loss.	"Obviously, I didn't do my part," he said. "It was just a pretty poor at-bat. It's easy to look back and see what I could've done differently."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: 1B Adrian Gonzalez was placed on the 10-day disabled list with lower back discomfort. An MRI on Monday revealed the five-time All-Star has a herniated disk. He is sidelined indefinitely. ... OF Joc Pederson was reinstated from the seven-day concussion disabled list and started in center field, going 0-for-4.	Indians: OF Brandon Guyer (sprained left wrist) is hitting on the field, but no date has been set for when he'll begin a minor league rehab assignment.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: RHP Brandon McCarthy tied his season high by throwing seven innings against the Nationals last Tuesday, but he absorbed a 2-1 loss.	Indians: RHP Corey Kluber has made quality starts in 14 of his 16 interleague outings, going 11-3 with a 2.34 ERA.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

DETROIT --  David Peralta had no intention of falling behind Detroit closer Justin Wilson in the ninth inning of Tuesday's tie game between the Tigers and Arizona Diamondbacks.	Peralta led off and swung at Wilson's first pitch, hitting a solo home run to left center and lifting the Diamondbacks to a 7-6 win.	"Always aggressive. That's it, man," said Peralta, who finished with three hits, capped by his sixth homer of the season. "I was looking for a fastball, so if he made a mistake, I'd be ready to make him pay."	The Diamondbacks, who improved to 8-1 in interleague games, gave starter Zack Greinke a 6-0 lead in the third inning before the Tigers rallied for six runs in the sixth to tie it.	"This does show what kind of team we are. We never give up," Peralta said. "We're good and I think we're showing people that."	Arizona reliever Archie Bradley (2-1) pitched a scoreless eighth to pick up the win and Fernando Rodney had a perfect ninth for his 17th save. Greinke went 5 2/3 innings and allowed five runs, all unearned, and five hits.	"That's what these guys do. They find ways to win games," said Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo. "Although it was a very frustrating sixth inning, we caught our breath and came up big."	Wilson (2-2) took the loss after allowing the homer to Peralta. Starter Buck Farmer went 2 1/3 innings and allowed six runs on nine hits. He was 2-0 and had gone 13 straight scoreless innings before Tuesday.	"It was location," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said of Farmer. "The balls that were hit out were in the middle of the plate. He wasn't going to go through the entire season without giving up a run. It was bound to happen."	The Diamondbacks jumped on Farmer early, scoring twice in the first inning on RBI singles by Chris Owings and Brandon Drury.	Arizona added four runs in the third on two-run homers by Paul Goldschmidt and Drury, giving the Diamondbacks a 6-0 advantage.	"For a game that looked like it was going entirely the Diamondbacks way, I thought we did a good job of turning it around," Ausmus said.	The Tigers fought back in the sixth, with help from a throwing error on shortstop Owings, who tried to turn a double play on Alex Avila's ground ball but threw the ball into left field. Ian Kinsler scored on the error and Avila went to second.	Miguel Cabrera followed with an RBI double, then J.D. Martinez hit a two-run homer to make it 6-4. Alex Presley and Jose Iglesias added RBI singles to tie the score.	"It was frustrating," Greinke said of the sixth inning. "I've got to make good pitches. I made a bad one to J.D. Martinez and walked (Justin) Upton on some non-competitive pitches. I didn't do the job to get out of the inning."	IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE	Former Tigers closer Francisco Rodriguez, who was demoted earlier this season after struggling, showed he can still be an effective reliever in the seventh inning. After Peralta led off with a double against Tigers pitcher Chad Bell, Rodriguez entered in a 6-6 game. He struck out Goldschmidt swinging, forced a ground out from Jake Lamb and got Owings to fly out to center.	"I want to continue to get him into higher leverage situations," Ausmus said. "We're a lot better team when he's pitching in those situations successfully."	TRAINING ROOM	Diamondbacks: OF A.J. Pollock (strained right groin) will resume running bases this week and the Diamondbacks would like him to play a few minor league rehab games before rejoining the team. He has been on the DL since the middle of May.	Tigers: RHP Michael Fulmer underwent an MRI last weekend after feeling pinching in his right shoulder during his last couple starts. The MRI indicated shoulder bursitis and he received a cortisone shot. Fulmer, who played catch on Monday and Tuesday, is scheduled to start on Saturday against Tamp Bay.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: RHP Taijuan Walker (4-3, 3.46 ERA) is expected to be reinstated from the 10-day DL after suffering a blister on his right hand. Walker, who won his last start against the Padres on May 19, will face the Tigers in a 7:10 p.m. start on Wednesday.	Tigers: RHP Jordan Zimmermann (5-4, 5.72) is expected to start against the Diamondbacks.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

NEW YORK --  Joe Maddon had a big idea to turn around his slumping Chicago Cubs.	How big? About 240 pounds, right at the top of the batting order.	Anthony Rizzo began the game with a long home run after a surprising move to the leadoff spot, rookie Ian Happ hit his first career grand slam and the Cubs trounced the New York Mets 14-3 on Tuesday night.	"It just worked out perfectly," Maddon said.	Backed by a season-best seven-run second inning, the World Series champs snapped a nine-game skid on the road and moved back to .500 through 64 games. The Cubs had lost five of six overall.	Jon Lester (4-4) earned his 150th win and matched a season high with 10 strikeouts. He allowed a run and five hits over seven innings.	Rizzo, batting leadoff for the first time in his career, had two hits, three RBI and a bases-loaded walk. He's reached safely in 21 of his last 36 plate appearances.	"The thing is, he's not impacted by that," Maddon said of moving Rizzo around the lineup. "He kind of has fun with it. He doesn't look at it in any other ways except it's going to be fun."	Rizzo got the Cubs rolling with a 462-foot shot to center field off Zack Wheeler (3-4). Chicago then batted around in the second, and the biggest blow came when Happ went the opposite way with the bases loaded for his sixth homer.	Every starter for the Cubs had at least one hit by the fourth inning, including Lester, who also drew a walk in the sixth. Jason Heyward, Kris Bryant and Javier Baez also went deep for Chicago, which matched a season high for runs and had 15 hits. Albert Almora Jr. had three hits and a walk.	"They all looked better," Maddon said.	Rizzo became the seventh Cubs player to bat leadoff this season, getting the nod from Maddon because Ben Zobrist is nursing a left wrist injury, and Kyle Schwarber and Happ have been struggling.	Except for his thick frame, Rizzo looked the part of a traditional leadoff man in his second plate appearance. After falling behind 0-2, he choked way up the bat and battled back for a bases-loaded, two-out walk. Happ's slam came in the next at-bat against Wheeler.	"He sets a great example of how to work an at-bat," Maddon said of Rizzo.	Rizzo also legged out an RBI double in the third.	Rizzo entered Tuesday with a .390 on-base percentage this season, while Chicago had a .306 OBP from the leadoff spot -- which ranked 24th in the majors. Dexter Fowler was a regular atop the lineup when the Cubs won the World Series last year, but he signed a free agent contract with St. Louis in the offseason.	Maddon plans to keep Rizzo in the leadoff spot Wednesday against New York, and he's ready for an extended stay up there.	"You know what? Let's go on a run now," Rizzo said. "That'd be great. Just keep winning, no matter what."	WHEELS OFF	Wheeler threw 46 pitches in the second and set career worsts with eight earned runs allowed in 1 2/3 innings.	"I don't know," he said. "I just didn't feel it tonight. That's unfortunate. I put us in a hole early."	Mets starters had given up one run or fewer in six straight games, the team's best run since 2010, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. New York had won four straight and five of six.	SPECIAL COMPANY	Lester tied Jered Weaver in seventh place for wins among active pitchers. Cubs teammate John Lackey ranks third with 180, and Atlanta's Bartolo Colon is first with 235.	What does the accomplishment mean to Lester?	"It means I'm old," he said.	ALL OR NOTHING	Happ also struck out four times, dropping his average to .207.	YO ALL GOOD?	Mets slugger Yoenis Cespedes was back in the lineup a day after being lifted with a sore left heel. He was replaced in left field after five innings by Curtis Granderson because of the "game situation," the team announced. New York trailed 9-1 at the time. Cespedes was 2 for 2 with an RBI double.	ONE SAVED	Mets right fielder Jay Bruce jumped and reached over the wall to rob Schwarber of a leadoff home run in the eighth.	FINISH STRONG	Neil Walker and Lucas Duda hit back-to-back solo homers for New York in the ninth.	CATCHING ON	Schwarber moved to catcher for the final two innings, his third appearance behind the plate this season.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: RHP Kyle Hendricks (hand tendinitis) felt more discomfort throwing on the side, dashing hopes that he might start this weekend in Pittsburgh. Hendricks might have further tests, including an MRI.	Mets: SS Asdrubal Cabrera was placed on the 10-day disabled list with a left thumb sprain. It's the same injury that landed him on the DL last month. Manager Terry Collins said he did not discuss calling up shortstop prospect Amed Rosario from Triple-A to fill in. INF T.J. Rivera was recalled instead. ... OF Michael Conforto was held out of the lineup for a second straight day with a stiff back.	UP NEXT	Cubs: LHP Mike Montgomery (0-3, 2.43 ERA) makes his second start since replacing Hendricks in the rotation.	Mets: RHP Matt Harvey (4-3, 5.02) pitched five scoreless innings against Atlanta last time out.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

MIAMI --  A fastball to the wrist didn't stop Giancarlo Stanton's recent surge.	Stanton returned to the Miami Marlins' starting lineup after recovering from a bruised right wrist and hit a two-run homer to help beat the Oakland Athletics 8-1 on Tuesday night.	Stanton missed only one start after being hit Saturday. His 17th homer of the year put Miami ahead 4-1 in the fifth inning.	"I worry when he gets hit by a pitch," teammate Marcell Ozuna said. "A 96 mph fastball? Maybe he breaks the wrist."	Instead, Stanton continued his recent tear. He's batting .354 with six homers in 18 games since moving to the No. 2 spot in the batting order.	Jose Urena (5-2) won his fourth consecutive decision by allowing one run in six-plus innings. The right-hander, who leads the Marlins in wins, retired 14 straight batters before tiring in the seventh.	"He's growing," manager Don Mattingly said. "Hopefully he just keeps building on what he's doing. You get to the point now where you feel like he's going to keep you in the game. His stuff is good enough. He doesn't go out and get knocked around. That's encouraging for young guys."	Ozuna hit his 16th homer and had two singles, hiking his average to .332. Tyler Moore added three hits, including a two-run double.	Ichiro Suzuki had a pinch-hit single in the eighth for his 364th interleague hit, tying Derek Jeter's major league record.	The Marlins won for the ninth time in their past 11 home games.	The Athletics (27-37), who have the worst record in the American League, fell to 10 games below .500 for the first time. They are 9-24 on the road.	Jharel Cotton (3-7) allowed five runs in five innings. He's 0-4 in his past five starts.	The Marlins scored four runs in the fifth, all with two outs. Dee Gordon's RBI single put them ahead 2-1, Stanton followed with his homer, and J.T. Realmuto added a run-scoring double.	"It's frustrating that everything came with two outs," Cotton said. "Everything just snowballed. I have to be better than that."	It was a familiar problem for the A's.	"We have to find a way to shut down the big inning like we've been giving up here recently," manager Bob Melvin said.	Urena balked home a run in the second with two outs and Cotton at the plate. Oakland didn't have another baserunner until the seventh.	Three Miami relievers combined to retire nine in a row and complete a three-hitter.	SUSTAINABLE?	Ozuna also had a strong half in 2016, but batted just .209 after the All-Star break. This year he's hoping to sustain his early success.	"Swing like crazy and let's see what happens," he said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: 1B Justin Bour (ankle bone bruise) is expected to play a rehab game Wednesday with Single-A Jupiter before rejoining the Marlins on Friday. ... 3B Martin Prado (right hamstring) and SS Adeiny Hechavarria (abdominal muscle) are scheduled to begin mid-week rehab assignments at Jupiter, and if they progress as expected, they'll rejoin the Marlins next week.	Athletics: RHP Chris Bassitt (elbow) has begun a throwing program.	UP NEXT: RHP Daniel Gossett is scheduled to make his major league debut Wednesday afternoon for the Athletics against RHP Edinson Volquez (3-7, 3.41), who pitched a no-hitter in his most recent home start June 3. Volquez has allowed three hits in 16 scoreless innings in his past two outings.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

CHICAGO --  Like many young power hitters, Matt Davidson's focus at the plate is not to get himself out.	"When I stay in the zone, I do pretty well, and so does everybody," Davidson said. "You want to swing at the ones in the zone."	The rookie definitely was in the zone on Tuesday night.	Davidson hit his first career grand slam, Derek Holland scattered eight hits over six innings and the Chicago White Sox beat the Baltimore Orioles 6-1.	Jose Abreu went 3 for 4 and Avisail Garcia had a two-run double as Chicago won its second straight after dropping nine of 11.	Davidson leads the White Sox with 12 homers in 163 at-bats.	"I know he has some days where it might seem like he's off kilter a little bit, but his mindset and his approach doesn't change," Chicago manager Rick Renteria said. "He goes in there very confident and wanting to do some damage. When he gets a pitch he can handle, he's able to drive it out of the ballpark."	Manny Machado had an RBI-single for the Orioles, who dropped to 31-32 with the loss -- the first time they've been under .500 since Oct. 3, 2015.	Holland (5-6) faced trouble in every inning, but managed to give up just one run. The left-hander had lost his three previous starts, allowing 15 earned runs in 13 innings (10.38 ERA) during that span.	Baltimore starter Alec Asher (2-5) allowed six runs and six hits in five-plus innings following a fast start.	The Orioles grabbed a 1-0 lead in the top of the first. Joey Rickard had a leadoff double, was sacrificed to third and scored on a long single by Machado that one-hopped the wall in left field. Machado was thrown out trying to stretch it into a double.	Chicago strung together three straight hits to begin the fourth inning to take a 2-1 lead. Melky Cabrera and Abreu singled to put runners on first and second. Garcia then doubled to the left-center gap to score both runners.	The Orioles seemed poised to answer in the fifth, but Holland worked out of a jam -- runners on first and third with no outs -- by getting Machado to pop up to second and cleanup hitter Mark Trumbo to bounce into a double play.	"The first-and-third situation was tough," Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said. "Guys are pushing and pushing. But just scoring one run, you can't put it all on one inning, that was more than that. You have to tip your hat to their pitcher, but we seem to be doing a lot of that lately."	Davidson's slam in the bottom of the inning made it 6-1 and knocked Asher out of the game.	"The first five innings were really good," Asher said. "The last inning, I kind of maybe tried to do a little too much and fell behind some hitters and made a mistake."	Abreu started the sixth with a single, Garcia was hit by a pitch and Todd Frazier walked to load the bases. Davidson worked the count to 3-2 and cracked a fastball deep into the left-field bleachers, a blast estimated at 438 feet.	"That one felt pretty good," he said. "You don't really feel anything when you hit balls like that."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: 1B Chris Davis likely is headed to the DL with a right oblique strain suffered in Monday's loss. Davis had an MRI on Tuesday and was scheduled to fly back to Baltimore on Tuesday night for further testing.	White Sox: RHP James Shields (right lat strain) allowed two runs and six hits over five innings in a rehab start for Triple-A Charlotte Tuesday night. He threw 90 pitches, striking out six and walking two. "Hopefully, this winds up being his last one and we activate him in the not-too-distant future," GM Rick Hahn said. ... LHP Carlos Rodon (left biceps bursitis) is scheduled to make his second rehab start for Charlotte (third overall) on Saturday.	UP NEXT	White Sox RHP Miguel Gonzalez (4-7, 4.89 ERA) will look to break out a recent slump in the third game of the four-game series. Gonzalez is 1-7 with a 6.56 ERA in his last eight starts. Orioles RHP Dylan Bundy (6-5, 3.05) is holding opponents to a .238 batting average this season.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

MINNEAPOLIS -- Eddie Rosario wasn't a very happy camper after not starting four games in the past nine days.	He took his frustrations out on the Seattle Mariners' pitching staff, and his teammates joined the hit party, as well.	Rosario hit three home runs and drove in five runs, and the Minnesota Twins set a franchise record with 28 hits while batting around in two different innings of a 20-7 victory over the Mariners at Target Field on Tuesday night.	"He made a little bit of a statement out there tonight," Twins manager Paul Molitor said. "He's been out a few days, and he came back with a vengeance."	Max Kepler and Brian Dozier also went deep, Eduardo Escobar had five hits and two RBIs and Jason Castro had four hits and four RBIs for the Twins, who are in first place in the American League Central, despite an AL-worst 13-19 record at home.	The 28 hits are the most in a game since the Rangers had 29 in a 30-3 win over the Baltimore Orioles on Aug. 22, 2007.	"We just couldn't stop them," Mariners manager Scott Servais said. "They kept squaring it up."	Christian Bergman (3-4) gave up nine runs and 10 hits in 2⅓ innings for the Mariners. Jarrod Dyson had a homer, a double and an RBI, while Ben Gamel had two doubles and an RBI for Seattle.	With slugger Miguel Sano getting a night off, the Twins batted around in a seven-run third inning and a seven-run seventh to snap a five-game home skid.	The Twins strung together eight straight hits in the third inning, including back-to-back homers by Rosario and Dozier, to bust the game wide open.	"I just had a bad day as far as stuff and command goes," Bergman said.	Rosario's second two-run shot of the game came off the first pitch from reliever Casey Lawrence, and Dozier followed with a solo shot for an 11-3 lead.	Rosario's final blast of the night came in the eighth inning off backup catcher Carlos Ruiz.	"Sometimes you have frustrations," Rosario said. "But I keep working hard. That's it."	Rosario is the first player in the modern era (since 1900) to have three home runs and four hits in a game from the ninth spot in the lineup, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. He is the fifth player to hit three homers while batting ninth.	A night after scoring 14 runs in a series-opening win over the Twins, the Mariners still pounded out 14 hits. Dyson's homer was his third of the season to set a career high.	UNIQUE VISIT	Kyle Gibson (4-4) picked up the win after wobbling through six innings, giving up six runs and 12 hits and striking out four.	After the Twins' big third inning, Gibson promptly gave up three doubles and two runs. That compelled Molitor to make a rare, one-on-one visit to the mound. Pitching coach Neil Allen remained in the dugout, and Castro remained behind the plate. It was just Molitor and Gibson talking man-to-man.	Molitor finished the visit by patting Gibson on the behind, and the right-hander was able to get the final two outs of the inning without surrendering another run.	"He just said, 'This is your game, and we need you to get to the seventh,'" Gibson said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: RHP Hisashi Iwakuma is scheduled to make his first rehab start for Class A Modesto on Thursday. Iwakuma has been out since May 7 with right shoulder inflammation. Servais said the plan is for three innings or 45 pitches. ... SS Jean Segura, out since June 2 with a right high ankle sprain, did some running on Wednesday at about 60 percent speed. He plans to take batting practice on Thursday.	Twins: LHP Glen Perkins, bothered by shoulder issues for the past two years, threw 21 pitches in a simulated game in Fort Myers, Florida. He will next throw on Friday in extended spring training. ... RHP Hector Santiago played long toss on Wednesday, and he remains in the mix to start a game in the doubleheader against the Cleveland Indians on Saturday.	UP NEXT	Mariners: RHP Sam Gaviglio (2-1, 2.79) takes the mound on Wednesday for Game 3 of the four-game series. He spent the first seven years of his career in the minor leagues before finally getting a chance this season.	Twins: RHP Ervin Santana (8-3, 2.20) will take the mound for the Twins, fresh off his majors-leading third shutout of the season, a 4-0 win over the San Francisco Giants on June 9.

HOUSTON --  Rougned Odor is finally starting to heat up, and it's helping the Texas Rangers do the same.	Odor hit a solo homer in the seventh inning and his tiebreaking two-run shot in the eighth lifted the Rangers to a 4-2 victory over the Houston Astros on Tuesday night, their fifth straight win.	"It's been probably the last three weeks that we've seen the ratio of barrel to ball start to show up better for us," manager Jeff Banister said. "Some better swings, laying off some pitches down and out of the zone a little more consistently. Limiting the chase. He came up huge for us tonight, really the last few nights."	Odor has hit four homers in the last eight games after managing just one in his previous 26. He finished with a season-high three hits and it is the first time this season he's had multiple hits in consecutive games all season after he had two on Monday.	"He's hit fastballs, he's hit the off-speed pitch, he's laid off some pitches down, he's laid off some of the fastball mix," Banister said. "He's just forcing these guys to pitch to him."	Odor tied it at 2-all when he dropped the first pitch of the seventh inning from Chris Devenski into the front row in right field.	He was at it again in the eighth when, after a single by Jonathan Lucroy with two outs, he connected off Luke Gregerson (2-2) into the seats in left field to put Texas up 4-2. It was the fifth career multi-home run game for Odor and his second this season.	Nick Martinez allowed five hits and two runs in six innings. Jose Leclerc (1-1) pitched a scoreless seventh for the win and Matt Bush allowed one hit in 1 1/3 innings for his eighth save.	George Springer and Carlos Correa hit solo homers for the first-place Astros, who lost for the sixth time in eight games.	Houston starter Brad Peacock yielded two hits and walked four with a season-high 10 strikeouts in 4 2/3 innings. He was pitching on three days' rest because of an injury to Lance McCullers.	"Peacock was exceptional," manager A.J. Hinch said. "I thought he got a little unlucky at the end when a couple of calls didn't go his way. All in all, he had really good put-away pitches and did a really good job of getting to the middle part of the game."	The Astros had runners at first and second with one out in the eighth inning, but Keone Kela retired Marwin Gonzalez before Bush struck out Jose Altuve to end the threat.	Lucroy, who turned 31 on Tuesday, finished with two hits for the Rangers, who improved to .500 (32-32) for the first time since May 25.	Springer put Houston up early with his MLB-leading seventh leadoff home run and Correa pushed the lead to 2-0 with his solo shot to left in the fourth.	The Rangers didn't have a hit until Lucroy singled to start the fifth inning. Odor followed with a single before Jurickson Profar reached on a fielder's choice to load the bases with one out. Shin-Soo Choo drew a walk with two outs to send a run home and chase Peacock. He was replaced by Will Harris, who retired Elvis Andrus to limit the damage.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: OF Carlos Gomez (right hamstring strain) is scheduled to play seven innings in a rehabilitation start for Double-A Frisco on Wednesday and if that goes well he could rejoin the Rangers as soon as Friday.	Astros: OF Josh Reddick was out on Tuesday after suffering a mild concussion crashing into the wall in right field trying to make a catch on Monday. Hinch said Reddick was being evaluated on Tuesday and the Astros weren't sure if he'll need to go on the 7-day concussion list.	LEADING OFF	Springer is one home run shy of matching the franchise record for most leadoff home runs in a season which he set last year and Craig Biggio accomplished in 2001. He's the second player in MLB history to have seven leadoff homers through June 13 of a season and first since Brady Anderson in 1996 for the Orioles.	UP NEXT	Rangers: Andrew Cashner (3-5, 3.17 ERA) will start in the finale of this series on Wednesday night. He allowed six hits and one run in seven innings in a 5-2 win over Washington on Friday.	Astros: Francis Martes (0-0, 9.82) is scheduled to make his first major league start on Wednesday. The 21-year-old, who is Houston's top prospect, yielded four hits and four runs in 3 2/3 innings in his major league debut on Friday against the Angels.	---	More AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ST. LOUIS --  Milwaukee Brewers third baseman Travis Shaw may have looked locked in Tuesday night, but his mind was hundreds of miles away.	Keon Broxton and Shaw hit solo home runs and combined for five RBI to help the Brewers beat the St. Louis Cardinals 8-5 and split their day-night doubleheader.	The Cardinals won the opener 6-0 behind Jose Martinez's two home runs.	In the nightcap, Shaw's eighth-inning single against Trevor Rosenthal (1-3) broke a 5-5 tie. Shaw, who was reinstated from a family medical emergency before the doubleheader, went 2 for 5 in the second game and drove in two runs.	Shaw left the club Friday after his newborn daughter, Ryann, had complications from open heart surgery. She's in stable condition now.	"It's nice to get back, at the same time my mind's still elsewhere," Shaw said. "There's more important things than baseball and a lot of things got put in perspective last week. It was nice to get a win, nice to contribute, but I'm still thinking about her at home."	Brewers right-hander Jimmy Nelson went 5 2/3 innings, but is still winless in 11 career games (10 starts) against the Cardinals. He gave up nine hits, two walks and struck out four.	Jared Hughes (2-1) got the decision after giving up a game-tying homer to Matt Carpenter. Corey Knebel earned his ninth save in 12 opportunities.	Back-to-back homers by Aguilar and Shaw sparked a four-run Brewers fourth. Broxton followed with an RBI triple and scored on a fielder's choice giving Milwaukee a 5-2 lead.	Broxton's line drive home run to lead off the third was the Brewers' first hit of the game. His sacrifice fly capped Milwaukee's three-run eighth.	"It wasn't the biggest number we've put on the board but it was the best offensive game we've had this year for sure," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. "The eighth inning was great at-bats up and down the lineup."	Broxton is hitting .583 (7 for 12) with two homers and five RBI at Busch Stadium this season.	"I think this park, I just kind of find my stroke whenever I get here," Broxton said. "I don't' know what it is. Timing I guess. I just try to keep things as simple as possible. Just see the ball."	Marco Gonzales lasted just 3 1/3 innings in making his first start since Sept. 1, 2015 after missing all of 2016 with Tommy John surgery. Three of the five hits he gave up were homers.	All four batters Rosenthal faced reached base and three scored, his worst outing since June 24, 2016, when he also gave up three runs without an out against Seattle.	"I feel like I'm pretty good about just showing up every day and giving it my best and that's what it's all about, but it's always tough just being in that spot," Rosenthal said. "It definitely stinks to be able to not get the job done."	After Martinez's RBI fielder's choice gave the Cardinals the lead in the first, Carpenter made it 2-0 with an RBI single in the second.	Dexter Fowler's two-out pinch-hit single in the sixth scored Aledmys Diaz and Carpenter led off the seventh with a homer to tie it 5-5.	In the opener, Martinez's 415-foot opposite field drive to right-center ignited a three-run Cardinals rally in the fifth. Carpenter followed with an RBI double and scored on Fowler's single to make it 3-0.	Right-hander Lance Lynn (5-3) struggled with his control with four walks, but was able to get out of a bases-loaded, one-out jam in the fifth. Lynn struck out eight, including the side in the fourth inning and Tyler Lyons pitched the final three innings of the opener to earn his first career save.	SAVE THAT BALL	Lewis Brinson legged out his first major league hit in the nightcap when Greg Garcia couldn't bare-hand his slow roller down the third base line in the third. Brinson was hitless in his first seven at-bats with the Brewers.	"You take it," Counsell said. "How they come, who cares?"	TRAINING ROOM	Brewers: RHP Brandon Woodruff (right hamstring tightness) was placed on the 10-day DL and RHP Paolo Espino was recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma City.	Cardinals: RHP Sam Tuivailala was recalled from Triple-A Memphis, INF Jhonny Peralta was given his unconditional release and INF Paul DeJong was optioned to Memphis.	UP NEXT	Brewers: RHP Zach Davies (7-3, 4.74 ERA) has won seven of his last eight decisions. He is 2-0 with a 2.81 ERA in five career starts against St. Louis.	Cardinals: RHP Mike Leake (5-5, 2.70 ERA) has given up 11 runs over his last three starts after given up 13 over his first nine. He is 5-4 with a 4.21 ERA in 14 career starts.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Just when CC Sabathia was pitching like an ace again, the big left-hander got hurt.	Sabathia exited early with a strained left hamstring, and Eric Young Jr. rallied the Los Angeles Angels to a 3-2 victory in 11 innings that snapped the New York Yankees' six-game winning streak Tuesday night.	Yankees manager Joe Girardi said he anticipates Sabathia is headed to the disabled list, a disappointing blow for the AL East leaders with the 2007 AL Cy Young Award winner on his best run in years.	Sabathia, who had won five straight starts, felt his hamstring grab on his second-to-last pitch in the fourth. He finished the inning but then came out of the game and expects to have an MRI on Wednesday.	"It's sore," he said. "It just happened. Hopefully I'll wake up tomorrow and it will feel a lot better."	Young tied the score with a solo homer off Tyler Clippard in the eighth and drove home the winning run with a sharp infield single off the leg of reliever Ben Heller with two outs in the 11th.	"I just try to keep it simple as possible and just get the barrel on the ball," Young said. "I was fortunate enough to hit it up the middle."	Young has three homers in 15 major league games this season, equaling his total from the previous four years combined. He was called up when the Angels lost star outfielder Mike Trout to thumb surgery last month.	"He's getting an opportunity and making the most of it," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "He's getting big hits."	With the bases loaded in the top of the 11th, rookie Keynan Middleton (2-0) induced consecutive popups from Chris Carter and Brett Gardner to earn the win.	"That's big for a young guy," Scioscia said.	In an unusual streak, the Angels improved to 11-0 on Tuesdays.	Chasen Shreve (1-1) took the loss after issuing a leadoff walk to Andrelton Simmons. He stole second and advanced to third on a high bouncer back to Heller.	Chase Headley had three hits for the Yankees, including a ground-rule double that led to their first run and a solo homer in the seventh that gave them a 2-1 lead. It was Headley's fourth home run.	Sabathia, who turns 37 next month, allowed only an unearned run after Carter failed to catch a throw from shortstop Didi Gregorius in the fourth. C.J. Cron capitalized on the first baseman's two-base error with a run-scoring single.	WALK IT OFF	The Angels are tied with Baltimore for the major league lead in walk-off victories with six, while the Yankees were handed their first walk-off loss this season.	HE WAS ROLLING	After opening the season with a 5.77 ERA and 27 strikeouts to 24 walks in his first seven outings, Sabathia has a 0.99 ERA and 35 strikeouts to seven walks in his last six starts. He is 7-2 with a 3.46 ERA overall.	STREAKING SHORTSTOP	Gregorius doubled in the 11th to extend his hitting streak to 15 games, longest in the majors. He is batting .381 (24 for 63) in the last 15 games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: All-Star closer Aroldis Chapman (left rotator cuff inflammation) had his scheduled rehab outing with Class A Tampa at Bradenton rained out. Weather permitting, he is now slated to pitch Wednesday. Girardi said if Chapman can pitch by Friday, he would likely be activated from the disabled list Sunday.	Angels: Trout (left thumb ligament surgery) said his recovery is progressing on schedule and he has not ruled out returning prior to the July 11 All-Star Game. That would get him back just after the five-week mark, a week earlier than the six to eight weeks he was originally expected to be out. Trout said he is not catching with his left hand, but has started throwing with his right.	UP NEXT	Yankees: RHP Michael Pineda (7-3, 3.39 ERA) pitches the series finale Wednesday on six days' rest. New York is 9-3 in his starts.	Angels: RHP Matt Shoemaker (6-3, 4.22) is beginning to find his form. He is 5-1 with a 3.19 ERA in his last six starts, but 0-2 in two career starts against the Yankees.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

SAN DIEGO --  When manager Andy Green came to the mound in the eighth inning, Clayton Richard thought his outing was over.	Richard stayed in the game, however -- and nearly finished it.	The left-hander carried a shutout into the ninth and Franchy Cordero homered twice as the San Diego Padres beat the slumping Cincinnati Reds 6-2 on Tuesday night.	One out from going the distance, Richard was removed after pinch-hitter Tucker Barnhart's two-run double. He allowed eight hits while striking out six and walking two on 127 pitches.	"I really appreciate the opportunity he gave me there, because I don't think a lot of managers do that in that situation," Richard said. "I felt really appreciative to try and finish what I started. Unfortunately in the ninth, I wasn't able to get it done."	Brandon Maurer got the final out for his 11th save, sealing Cincinnati's fifth straight loss.	"I desperately wanted to see him get that last out," Green said, referring to Richard. "He deserves those kinds of opportunities. He has earned them with trust over the years."	Richard (5-7) tossed San Diego's only complete game of the season on May 21. This time, he left to a standing ovation.	"It's special," Richard said. "That's what makes it fun is the fans know they are a part of this. It's great."	Cordero hit a drive to center field in the first inning against Scott Feldman (5-5) and added another solo homer onto the beach beyond the right-center field fence in the seventh. The multihomer game was Cordero's first, after he hit his first career home run on Monday.	"I'm just getting some pitches to hit and getting the barrel on the ball," Cordero said through a translator. "The results are showing up."	Feldman allowed four runs and eight hits over five innings. He struck out six and walked two.	"Baseball's a funny game and sometimes you can make pitches and get weak contact and they find holes and other times you can make terrible pitches and they hit it right at guys," Feldman said. "That's the beauty of baseball, but also at the same time it's kind of a frustrating part sometimes, but it's just part of the deal."	San Diego got to Feldman early. The first four batters he faced singled as the Padres built a 2-0 lead.	Wil Myers and Yangervis Solarte each drove in a run in the first. Cory Spangenberg singled home Solarte in the fifth to make it 4-0.	"They had four singles on seven pitches. They had two runs in seven pitches into the game, and none of them were really hit on the barrel, but that's putting the ball in play and making something happen," Reds manager Bryan Price said. "They were able to do that. They were aggressive early in the count, they fought off some pitches inside, a couple ground ball hits, a couple of soft base hits into the outfield and next thing you know it's 2-0. Scott battled, he battled his heart out, and just fell behind 4-0 and then we weren't really able to do much."	Cordero finished with a career-high three hits. Myers, Solarte, Jose Pirela and Austin Hedges each had two for the Padres.	QUOTABLE	"I've been on the other side, too, and the boos aren't as fun." -- Richard on receiving a standing ovation.

SAN FRANCISCO --  His surgically repaired left elbow no longer a concern, Jason Vargas is pitching better than he has at any time in his career.	That and a solid rapport with veteran catcher Salvador Perez have Vargas on quite a roll.	Vargas pitched seven strong innings, Alcides Escobar hit a two-run double in a six-run sixth and the Kansas City Royals beat the San Francisco Giants 8-1 on Tuesday night.	"He was sharp, he was on the attack, commanded his pitch count well, good off-speed stuff . excellent," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "He's just back to being healthy. When he was healthy before, Vargy was really good."	Just not this good.	Vargas' nine wins are tied for most in the majors with Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw and Dallas Keuchel of the Astros. They are five shy of Vargas' career high set in 2012 when he was still pitching for Seattle.	Vargas also has a 2.18 ERA that is second-lowest among qualifiers behind Keuchel's mark of 1.67.	"I definitely enjoy being healthy and going out there and having some success and giving the team an opportunity to win," Vargas said. "You kind of look at the road that you had to come back and try and appreciate it. I'm just trying to go about my business and take each start as they come."	Vargas (9-3) allowed one run and outpitched Ty Blach in a matchup of left-handers. Vargas gave up five hits with six strikeouts and one walk for his fourth straight win overall and second against the Giants this season.	Jorge Bonifacio drove in three runs and snapped an 0-for-13 drought. Alex Gordon added two hits and two runs, and Whit Merrifield had a bases-loaded triple to help Kansas City win in its first appearance at AT&T Park since the 2014 World Series.	Buster Posey had two hits and scored San Francisco's run. The Giants have lost 10 of 14.	Escobar, whose leadoff single in the third sparked a two-run rally, broke the game open with a bases-loaded double off Blach (4-4) in the sixth. After Gordon was intentionally walked and Vargas struck out, Merrifield lofted a fly ball that landed beyond sliding right fielder Hunter Pence near the foul line to put the Royals up 7-1. Bonifacio followed with an RBI single.	That was more than enough for Vargas, who pitched seven scoreless innings to beat the Giants in Kansas City on April 19.	"The big inning is what killed us," San Francisco manager Bruce Bochy said. "It's one of those nights. We got shut down by Vargas."	Coming off its best offensive game of the season two days earlier, San Francisco struggled against Vargas and reliever Travis Wood. The Giants were limited to five hits and scored their only run on a sacrifice fly after Posey doubled leading off the second.	BLACHED OUT	Blach allowed seven runs and 10 hits over 5 1/3 innings, only the second bad outing he's had since replacing injured ace Madison Bumgarner in the Giants' rotation. Blach struck out four and walked one. "They placed the ball just out of reach three or four times there," Bochy said. "It's a shame because Ty threw the ball well tonight. He really did. The numbers are not indicative of how he threw."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals: LHP Danny Duffy (right oblique strain) threw 20 pitches in a bullpen session Monday and came out of it with no lingering pain. Duffy has been sidelined since May 29.	Giants: With a left-hander pitching, 2B Joe Panik was given an additional day off to rest his sprained left thumb. Aaron Hill started in Panik's place.	UP NEXT	Royals: RHP Jason Hammel (2-6, 5.43 ERA) pitches the finale of this two-game series. Hammel is winless in eight road starts dating to 2016.	Giants: RHP Johnny Cueto (5-5, 4.33) faces his former team for the first time since signing with San Francisco after helping Kansas City to the 2015 World Series title.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

MIAMI --  A four-run deficit no longer looms so large for the Miami Marlins.	Marcell Ozuna homered to start a comeback Wednesday afternoon, and Miami beat the Oakland Athletics 11-6 to complete a two-game sweep.	Ozuna hit his 17th home run in the second inning after the Marlins fell behind 4-0. He added a double and finished with three RBI to help overcome a wobbly outing by Edinson Volquez, who had a no-hitter in his most recent home start.	"Today I got lucky," Volquez said. "They picked me up."	Rallies were rare for the Marlins during their 14-27 start. But they've won 13 of their past 19 games, largely because the bats came alive.	"There were times last month when it felt like if the other team scored first, we were in trouble," manager Don Mattingly said. "Now you don't have the same feeling."	Tyler Moore hit his fifth homer and scored three times. Christian Yelich and Dee Gordon each had two hits and two RBI.	"It has all been clicking for us the last couple of weeks," Yelich said. "We got some guys hot at the same time and are putting a lot of pressure on teams. We can score runs a lot of different ways -- manufacturing, or guys leaving the ballpark."	Ryon Healy hit a three-run homer for the Athletics (27-38), who fell to 11 games below .500 for the first time. They went 1-5 on their trip and lost their ninth consecutive road series, their longest such streak since 1986.	Oakland lost after leading by three or more runs three times on the trip. Daniel Gossett (0-1) couldn't hold the early lead in his major league debut after being called up from Triple-A Nashville, and allowed seven runs, six earned, in 3 1/3 innings.	"It was not exactly the way I drew it up, but I'm so fortunate to get the opportunity to play in the big leagues," Gossett said. "It was everything you dream of, minus the outcome."	Volquez lasted only four innings and gave up four hits, four walks and five runs, four earned. Kyle Barraclough (2-1), the first of six Miami relievers, pitched a scoreless fifth.	INTERLEAGUE RECORD	Miami's Ichiro Suzuki had a pinch-hit infield single in the fifth for his 365th interleague hit, breaking Derek Jeter's major league record.	"Amazing," Mattingly said. "A lot of games, a lot of hits. You're talking about him and Derek, obviously two Hall of Fame guys. The length of their careers -- that's really greatness, the guys that can be good for long periods of time."	PITCHER HITTING	Gossett reached in the fourth on an infield single , his first major league hit and the first by Athletics pitchers in their past 27 at-bats over two seasons.	"You can close your eyes and swing, and sometimes it works," Gossett said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Oakland: RF Matt Joyce left in the third, one inning after he cut his chin colliding with first baseman Yonder Alonso pursuing a popup, which Alonso caught. Joyce received three stitches but said the injury wasn't serious.	Miami: LHP Braxton Garrett, the Marlins' top prospect, will receive a second opinion on his sore left elbow next week from specialist Dr. James Andrews. Garrett has been diagnosed with a partial tear of the ulnar collateral ligament and could require Tommy John surgery.	ROSTER MOVE	To make room on the roster for Gossett, 1B-OF Matt Olson was optioned to Nashville.	DRAFT PICK	The Marlins took the brother of Chicago Bears tight end Dion Sims in the 14th round of the draft. Demetrius Sims is a shortstop at Bethune-Cookman.	UP NEXT	Miami: The Marlins hit the road after winning for the 10th time in their past 12 home games. They visit the new ballpark in Atlanta for the first time to begin a three-game series Friday, when RHP Dan Straily (4-4, 3.89) will pitch against LHP Sean Newcomb (0-1, 0.00).	Oakland: The A's return home for a four-game series against the Yankees beginning Thursday, when RHP Sonny Gray (2-2, 4.37) will face LHP Jordan Montgomery (4-4, 3.55).	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

SAN DIEGO --  Franchy Cordero and Hunter Renfroe, teammates in the Pacific Coast League last season, combined to drive in all of the San Diego Padres' runs in a 4-2, sweep-clinching victory over the Cincinnati Reds on Wednesday.	Renfroe hit his 14th home run, a two-run shot that tied the score 2-2 in the sixth inning, and Cordero hit a tie-breaking single in the seventh before Renfroe's RBI groundout finished the surge.	"I know exactly what Franchy's all about, and he's done everything I expected of him since he came up," Renfroe said of his fellow rookie.	Padres starter Jhoulys Chacin (6-5) pitched seven innings, allowing five hits and two runs.	Reds reliever Michael Lorenzen (3-2) inherited a 2-2 score from starter Amir Garrett and began the seventh with two walks, leading to two runs.	The Reds, who have lost their past nine road games, were swept at both Dodger Stadium and Petco Park to go 0-6 on the West Coast trip.	The left-handed hitting Cordero hit three home runs over the first two games of the series.	He had two singles in the finale. The second, a groundball to right field, scored Matt Szczur, who had drawn a leadoff walk against Lorenzen as a pinch-hitter.	The RBI single came after Cordero mistakenly attempted to bunt, causing third-base coach Glenn Hoffman to tell him to swing away.	"We made sure that he got the message that we trusted his bat," manager Andy Green said.	Green said Cordero, who made his major league debut May 27 as a replacement for injured center fielder Manuel Margot, was "being selfless" when he tried to bunt, but the smarter play was to swing because Lorenzen is a strikeout pitcher.	Green said the advice to Renfroe was to be patient.	"Hunter Renfroe does not need to cheat to get to any pitch," Green said.	Renfroe hit Garrett's 88 mph fastball 429 feet into the top of the second deck to score Yangervis Solarte and tie Nate Colbert for the most home runs by a Padres rookie before the All-Star break. Colbert went on to hit 24 home runs in that expansion season, 1969.	Brandon Mauer recorded his 12th save in 14 tries after Brad Hand threw a scoreless eighth.	The Reds rediscovered their home run prowess, getting solo shots from Jose Peraza and Joey Votto after not adding to the team's majors-leading home run total in the series' first and second games.	Peraza hit Chacin's second pitch of the game into the left-field seats for the team's first leadoff homer of the season. For Peraza, it was his third home run.	Votto cleared the wall in right-center field for his 19th homer.	Garrett took a 2-0 lead into the sixth before Solarte singled and Renfroe blasted the lefty's 91st pitch of the afternoon.	The lefty starter, 25, brought in an ERA of 7.40.	"This was a great step," Reds manager Bryan Price said. "He's a great kid, he's a great worker, everybody pulls for Amir to do well, and I think that was certainly a step in the right direction because he was throwing three pitches over the plate for strikes and he was on the attack."	HIGHLIGHT DEFENSE	Prompting applause from Garrett, three Reds defenders teamed up to nab Erick Aybar trying to score from first on Luis Torrens' second-inning double.	Center fielder Arismendy Alcantara threw to second baseman Scooter Gennett, who threw to catcher Tucker Barnhart. Video review upheld the out call of plate umpire Ted Barrett.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: Zack Cosart, who went into Wednesday as the leading vote-getter at shortstop for the All-Star Game, was out of the starting lineup with a quad injury for the second day in a row. He was pulled from Monday's lopsided game due to the quad.	Padres: RHP Trevor Cahill is expected to throw bullpen sessions on the upcoming trip and then begin a minor league assignment.	UP NEXT	Reds: RHP Tim Adelman (4-2, 4.34) on Friday will face the Los Angeles Dodgers in Cincinnati after going 2-0 with 2.08 ERA in his past four starts.	Padres: RHP Miguel Diaz, who made 21 relief appearance this year, will make his second career start Friday against the Milwaukee Brewers in San Diego. In his first start, last Saturday against the Kansas City Royals, the rookie was unable to get an out in the third inning.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Royals slugger Mike Moustakas didn't care to get caught up in a debate concerning whether or not his latest home run landed in the waters of McCovey Cove.	With Kansas City finally finding a comfortable groove after a rocky start to the season, Moustakas is thinking big picture.	Moustakas hit his 18th home run leading off the second inning, Jorge Bonifacio and Lorenzo Cain followed with back-to-back shots in the third and the Royals beat the San Francisco Giants 7-2 on Wednesday to complete a two-game sweep.	The win was Kansas City's fourth straight and left the Royals at 30-34 -- not bad for a ballclub that was nine games under .500 one month into the season.	"We're trending in the right direction," Moustakas said. "We've been playing great baseball on this road trip and if we keep this going we're going to be in a good spot after the end of this month."	Moustakas, one of Kansas City's top hitters over the past two weeks, stayed hot with his home run off former Royals pitcher Johnny Cueto (5-6) that initially appeared to land in McCovey Cove. Officials later determined that the ball landed on a walkway and bounced into the water.	It was the fifth homer in 12 games for Moustakas, who is already just four shy of his career-high.	"It's all good, a homer's a homer," Moustakas said.	Bonifacio finished with two hits and three RBI, Whit Merrifield added three hits and three runs while Alcides Escobar singled three times to help Jason Hammel end an eight-game winless stretch on the road that dated to 2016.	Hammel (3-6) allowed one run over 6 2/3 innings to beat the Giants for the first time in 12 starts. The right-hander gave up eight hits, struck out four and walked one.	"He commanded the ball really well, he changed speeds, he used his slider effectively, got some big swings and misses," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "His last couple of starts, he's really come on for us."	Bonifacio homered in the third after Merrifield opened the inning with a bunt single. Two pitches later, Cain lined an 0-1 pitch over the fence in left-center that put the Royals up 4-0.	Cueto struggled in his first appearance against his former team since signing with San Francisco after helping Kansas City to the 2015 World Series. He allowed five runs and 10 hits over 5 2/3 innings with three walks and five strikeouts.	Kansas City has scored seven or more runs in each of its last four games, all wins.	Eduardo Nunez had two hits and an RBI for San Francisco. The Giants have lost 11 of 15.	San Francisco had two on and two outs twice but failed to score each time. Hammel fanned Brandon Crawford to end the fourth and reliever Peter Moylan got Buster Posey to ground out to end the seventh.	"The way we're swinging, it's a steep climb," San Francisco manager Bruce Bochy said. "This is humbling to go through something like this. It's a tough time for these fellows."	WALKED OFF	Brandon Belt's walk in the seventh inning was the first free pass issued by Hammel since May 29. It also was the last batter the right-hander faced, as Yost came scurrying out of the dugout to replace him with Moylan. Hammel hardly resisted. "I don't ever want to say I was getting tired but that inning the pitches were up," he said. "Probably the right move there."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Giants: 2B Joe Panik returned to the lineup after being sidelined for four games with a sprained left thumb he injured last week in Milwaukee diving for a ground ball. He went 2 for 4.	UP NEXT	Royals: LHP Matt Strahm (1-3, 4.05) makes his first career start Thursday in Anaheim against the Angels. Strahm has made 20 appearances out of the bullpen this season.	Giants: LHP Matt Moore (2-7, 5.28) faces the Rockies for the third time this season when the teams play at Colorado in the opener of a four-game series Thursday. Moore is winless in his previous five starts.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

WASHINGTON --  The Atlanta Braves had dropped three straight before this week's series against the Washington Nationals.	That only makes their rare series victory against the defending NL East champs even sweeter.	Julio Teheran earned his third consecutive victory, Kurt Suzuki homered and Atlanta defeated Washington 13-2 on Wednesday to take two of three from the Nationals.	"It's a tough place to win," manager Brian Snitker said. "It's a very good team and we were coming off a rough series at home. Guys responded well. We started swinging the bats and the bullpen did a great job. It was a good series for us."	Brandon Phillips had four hits and three RBI for the Braves, who had dropped seven consecutive road series against the Nationals and had lost 23 of their last 25 games in Washington before this series. It was Atlanta's first series victory at Washington since taking two during a three-game set April 4-6, 2014.	Teheran (6-4) matched a season-high with seven innings, allowing six hits and one walk while striking out three against a lineup that did not include resting regulars Anthony Rendon and Matt Wieters.	"Even if I give up a homer or something, I just have to stay focused and execute pitches," Teheran said. "That's something I was doing really good -- getting ahead in counts and throwing strike one. It was big today."	Washington lost its second consecutive series and finished 2-5 on its homestand.	"It was a tough homestand," Washington manager Dusty Baker said. "This is not the kind of homestand you want to exhibit in front of your home fans."	Atlanta was in control from the start against Washington starter Tanner Roark (6-4), who gave up two runs before he recorded an out and three total in the first inning.	The Braves would add three more in the third, with Nick Markakis scoring from third after Nationals catcher Jose Lobaton's pickoff attempt of Matt Kemp caught first baseman Ryan Zimmerman off guard and sailed into right field. Kemp was thrown out at third and left the game the following half-inning as a precaution after experiencing hamstring tightness.	After a walk to Matt Adams, Suzuki hit his fourth home run of the season to make it 6-2.	Teheran yielded a two-run homer to Brian Goodwin in the second inning, but otherwise encountered little difficulty. He did not allow a runner past second base after Goodwin's home run.	"Julio pitched a really good game," Kemp said. "He made one mistake but other than that he was money."	Roark surrendered nine hits while matching a season-high with seven runs allowed over five innings.	SUZUKI'S BREAKOUT	Suzuki's home run snapped an 0-for-19 slump. The catcher added a single in the seventh, securing his first multi-hit game since May 23.	ALL IN THE FAMILY	The Nationals selected OF Darren Baker, the son of manager Dusty Baker, in the 27th round of the baseball draft. Darren Baker already holds a place in baseball lore; as a 3-year-old bat boy during the 2002 World Series, he was swooped up by San Francisco 1B J.T. Snow to avoid injury at home plate.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Braves: The team announced INF Adonis Garcia underwent surgery Monday to repair ligament damage in his left ring finger. Garcia, who is hitting .247 with four homers and 16 RBI, went on the DL June 7 and is expected to miss about two months.	Nationals: OF Chris Heisey, on the DL since May 24 with a ruptured right biceps, will not join the team on its trip to New York and Miami. "He's not close, I don't think," Baker said. "He's not as close as he thought he was a couple weeks ago. That injury is a lot more serious than he and we thought it was."	UP NEXT	Braves: Rookie LHP Sean Newcomb (0-1, 0.00) makes his second start as Atlanta opens a weekend series with Miami at home Friday.	Nationals: LHP Gio Gonzalez (5-1, 2.91) seeks his third win in his last four starts as Washington begins a four-game series against the Mets.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

PHILADELPHIA --  The Red Sox sure didn't look like a team that didn't get to bed until the sun came up Wednesday.	Mookie Betts homered twice, Xander Bogaerts had three RBI and the bullpen continued to be lights out as the Boston Red Sox beat the Philadelphia Phillies 7-3 for their third straight win.	It would have been understandable if Boston were sluggish in this game after travel issues didn't have their plane land in Philadelphia until 4 a.m.	But the Red Sox weren't looking for excuses and came out from the first pitch and pounded the Phillies.	"It just kind of happened," Betts said. "One guy follows the guy in front of them and it just kind of worked out. It feels great after all the things that went into getting here. I'm happy we did it under four hours and we can get a little rest before tomorrow."	Betts had four hits and drove in three to lead an offensive barrage off Phillies starter Jeremy Hellickson (5-5). Boston tagged him for six runs on nine hits in just five innings.	Betts led off the game with a single, had an RBI double in the second, but his biggest hit was a solo home run, his 10th of the season, in the fourth inning after the Phillies had scored three runs to close within 5-3.	He had a chance to get the cycle in the ninth inning, but instead of a triple connected for home run No. 11 to put the game out of reach. It was his eighth career multi-homer game.	"When Mookie gets a lead off base hit we were trying to create some energy because of the time we got (into town)," said Red Sox manager John Farrell. "We were able to string a bunch of hits together and Mookie had some big swings to get it started and we were able to build a five-run lead."	Betts was dazzling defensively as well, and made a stellar diving catch in right field to rob Howie Kendrick of a hit in the fifth inning.	Bogaerts was also impressive, with a two-run double off Hellickson in the first and a single that scored Betts in the second. He also had a fine defensive play robbing Hellickson of an infield hit, squashing a potential Phillies rally in the fourth.	Andrew Benintendi drove in the other Red Sox run with a sacrifice fly.	Both teams had multiple highlight plays defensively. Aside from Betts and Bogaerts, Benintendi made a leaping catch in foul territory taking a ball out of the stands, Pablo Sandoval made a pair of diving plays at third, Dustin Pedroia stretched his errorless game streak to 88, which included some difficult chances and Jackie Bradley Jr. made a running, over-the-shoulder grab to end the game.	"We made a number of great defensive plays tonight," Farrell said.	For its part, Philadelphia did a fine job defensively as well, turning four double plays.	The Phillies scored three runs off Boston starter Brian Johnson in the third inning on a two-out single by Kendrick and a two-run home run by Aaron Altherr, his 10th of the season.	Johnson left the game with an arm injury, but the Red Sox bullpen shut the door on the Phillies, as four different relievers combined to allow just two hits over the final 6 1/3 innings. Hector Velazquez (1-1) was credited with his first major league win.	The Boston bullpen has now gone 21 1/3 consecutive innings without allowing a run.	Not much is going right for the Phillies who have the worst record in baseball. They have lost eight consecutive games as well as all eight interleague games this season, matching a franchise record for consecutive interleague losses since games between the two leagues started in 1997.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: Starting pitcher Brian Johnson left the game in the third inning with what the Red Sox indicated was left shoulder discomfort. He will be reevaluated in Boston Friday. Johnson said he started to feel tightness in warmups and came out as a precaution. After two strong innings, Johnson lost a lot of velocity on his pitches, leading to the Phillies only offensive outburst of the game.	Phillies: 2B Cesar Hernandez will be out of action for at least six weeks with an oblique strain, but that doesn't mean the Phillies are going to call up red hot prospect Scott Kingery, who leads all of minor league baseball with 18 home runs at Double A Reading. Kingery isn't on the 40-man roster currently and Phillies GM Matt Klentak said before the game that Kingery isn't ready for a call-up.

PITTSBURGH --  The Colorado Rockies, road warriors?	Believe it.	Ian Desmond hit his fourth home run of the season and rookie German Marquez pitched effectively into the sixth inning as the surprising Rockies beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 5-1 on Wednesday night to snap a three-game losing streak.	Marquez (5-3) gave up one run and four hits in five-plus innings as Colorado avoided being swept for the first time this season. Raimel Tapia went 4 for 4 and scored three times for the Rockies. Jake McGee bailed Colorado out of a bases-loaded, one-out jam in the seventh.	The Rockies have won a major-league best 25 games on the road.	"They persevere, they stay at it," manager Bud Black said. "There's sort of a quiet tenacity to our group."	The Pirates managed just one extra-base hit and left eight men on as their season-high four-game winning streak came to an end.	Chad Kuhl (1-6) remained winless since April 8. He gave up three runs in five innings and his ERA sits at 5.61 through 12 starts, though he's improved of late. Kuhl's ERA is 3.60 over his last three appearances. Manager Clint Hurdle plans on keeping Kuhl in the rotation for now.	"As far as the battle, the fight, it was there," Hurdle said. "Talking about 3-0 (when Kuhl exits). Yeah it's not what you're looking for leaving the clubhouse, then again it's not like he got barreled up."	The Rockies are one of the biggest surprises in the majors, fueled by a starting rotation dotted with rookies and a newfound competence away from Coors Field. The 22-year-old Marquez is helping lead the way. He improved to 3-1 with a 3.00 ERA on the road after keeping the surging Pirates in check then relying on the bullpen to do the rest.	"He was a little erratic at times, but the stuff was good and he made some pitches when he needed to," Black said.	Marquez bounced back from the shortest outing of his brief career (three innings in a loss to the Chicago Cubs last Friday) to work into the sixth. By then the Rockies already had a 3-0 lead.	Desmond sent a pitch from Kuhl just over the reach of left fielder John Jaso with one out in the second to put Colorado up. The Rockies added two more in the fifth. Desmond led off with a walk and scored on Trevor Story's RBI-single. Tapia then darted home when Pittsburgh first baseman Josh Bell couldn't field Marquez's sacrifice bunt.	The Pirates had a chance to get back in it in the seventh, loading the bases with one out. McGee came on and got Adam Frazier to fly out to center then struck out Josh Harrison on three pitches.	"Five, six and seven we're out there," Hurdle said. "If we get one of those innings to click, it's a different game."	Pittsburgh didn't threaten again as Colorado won for just the third time in its last 14 games at PNC Park.	HOT HEADS	The benches cleared briefly in the fifth after Marquez hit Pittsburgh catcher Francisco Cervelli in the left arm with a pitch. Cervelli, activated off the 10-day DL earlier in the day after recovering from a concussion, exchanged words with Colorado catcher Tony Wolters. Players and coaches made their way onto the field but quickly dispersed.	"When you get hit at 98 you get scared man," Cervelli said. "As a catcher, your job is avoid the fight and not just be talking and looking for fights, that's it."	CARGO BENCHED	Black is giving struggling outfielder Carlos Gonzalez a break hoping it will help him break out of an extended funk.  Gonzalez, a three-time All-Star, is hitting just .215 this season and is 0 for 24 over his last seven games.	"You can look at the numbers and they're not good right now," Black said. "But he's going to come out of it."	TRADE COMPLETED	The Pirates shipped minor-league pitcher Matt Frawley to the New York Yankees to complete the April 17 trade that sent reliever Johnny Barbato to Pittsburgh. The 21-year-old Frawley was 3-1 with three saves and a 1.62 ERA for Pittsburgh's Class-A affiliate West Virginia.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: LHP Antonino Bastardo (left squad strain) will stay in Triple-A for the time being as he works his way back. Bastardo, out since mid-May, has allowed three runs in 7 1/3 innings across seven appearances for the Indians.	UP NEXT	Rockies: Begin a seven-game homestand on Thursday against San Francisco. Colorado rookie Jeff Hoffman (4-0, 2.33) will look for his fifth straight victory. Matt Moore (2-7, 5.28) starts for the Giants.	Pirates: Are off Thursday and open a three-game home set with the Cubs on Friday. Trevor Williams (3-3, 5.13 ERA) faces Eddie Butler (3-2, 4.03) in the opener.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

TORONTO -- Russell Martin came through to help the Toronto Blue Jays get a big win after they gave up a late lead.	The veteran catcher hit a tiebreaking home run in the bottom of the eighth inning to lift the Blue Jays to a 7-6 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays on Wednesday night.	It came right after the Rays scored three in the top of the inning to tie the score.	"I felt like our team at that moment needed that," Martin said. "So a nice bounce-back win, a collective win, I feel like we kind of battled that one out."	Kendrys Morales homered among his two hits and drove in four runs for the Blue Jays.	Trailing 6-3, the Rays tied it on Logan Morrison's 19th homer, a two-run shot off reliever Joe Smith (3-0) and Derek Norris' sacrifice fly. Martin then connected for his sixth home run of the season off reliever Jose Alvarado (0-1) over the center-right-field fence in the bottom half.	It was the first homer Alvarado has given up all season, and Rays manager Kevin Cash wasn't second-guessing his decision to put the reliever in the game after tying the score.	"I think the guy's earned the opportunity to come in there and pitch," Cash said. "You could tell Martin's approach from the first pitch what he was trying to do and he made an adjustment, got a pitch he could hit and knocked it out of the park."	Roberto Osuna ensured it stood up in the ninth, finally forcing Evan Longoria to pop out to second base to earn his 17th save of the season -- and 16th in a row, the longest active streak in the majors.	The Blue Jays recovered for the win after Francisco Liriano lasted a season-high seven innings against a Tampa Bay team that chased him after just 1/3 of an inning in his season opener, the shortest start of his career. Though the no-decision left him at 99 career wins, Liriano held Tampa to five hits and two earned runs, striking out nine.	"Shoot, he was dynamite," manager John Gibbons said after seeing his team split the two-game series with the Rays.	After surrendering two runs in the third, Liriano was on the verge of getting pulled after loading the bases with none out on two walks and a bunt in the fourth inning. However, he escaped the jam, giving up just one run, before retiring the next seven batters.	"It was big," Liriano said through a translator of getting out of that inning. "I just tried to execute pitches, let the guys behind me do the work and it worked out pretty well."	With the Blue Jays trailing 3-2 in the fifth, Morales hit a three-run shot into the second deck in right field for his 13th home run of the season and fourth RBI of the game. Morales also had a run-scoring grounder in the third for Toronto's first run.	Nine of Morales' home runs have either tied the game or given Toronto a lead this season.	Tampa starter Jake Oderizzi was knocked out of the game in the fifth inning, after surrendering the three-run shot to Morales. It marked the ninth consecutive appearance that Odorizzi had allowed a homer, a career high and the second-longest active streak in the majors behind 11 by Jesse Chavez of the Los Angeles Angels.	"There's definitely way better in me than what I'm doing right now and I will be better and I'll be better hopefully soon," he said.	GAME OF FIRSTS	After being called up from Triple-A Buffalo to replace the injured Ezequiel Carrera, OF Dwight Smith Jr. made the most of his opportunity, registering his first hit at Rogers Centre, his first career three-hit game and his first major-league steal.	GOING DEEP	Morales' home run was measured at 465 feet, the longest home run by any Blue Jays player this season.	DRAFT PICK	With their 11th-round pick, the Rays took University of Kentucky RHP Justin Lewis, who is the cousin of both Seattle Seahawks Pro Bowler Richard Sherman and former NBA forward Chuck Hayes.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: SS/2B Tim Beckham's knee responded well to treatment, according to Cash, and is expected to play this weekend in Detroit.	Blue Jays: OF Carrera was placed on the 10-day DL on Wednesday with a fractured right foot. The left fielder suffered fouled a ball off his foot in Tuesday night's loss to the Rays and while X-rays were negative, a CT scan Wednesday showed the fracture. ... Gibbons said OF Steve Pearce, out since May 15 with a calf strain, should rejoin the team by the weekend.	UP NEXT	Rays: The Rays visit Detroit for a four-game series beginning Thursday, when RHP Alex Cobb (5-5, 4.29) will take on RHP Justin Verlander (4-4, 4.68).	Blue Jays: After a day off, Toronto will open a three-game series against the White Sox on Friday with a matchup between RHP Joe Biagini (1-5, 3.38) and Chicago LHP Jose Quintana (2-8, 5.30).	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CLEVELAND --  Cleveland relief ace Andrew Miller wore a shocked expression after giving up a tiebreaking home run to Los Angeles pinch-hitter Kike Hernandez in the eighth inning Wednesday night.	Miller was still in a state of disbelief following the Dodgers' 6-4 win over the Indians.	"Home run never even crossed my mind when he hit it," he said. "I didn't think it was even going to threaten the warning track, to be honest with you. I obviously misread the swing."	Hernandez, batting for Chase Utley, hit a 1-2 pitch that barely cleared the wall in right field. Hernandez pumped his fist as he rounded first base after his homer gave Los Angeles a 3-2 lead.	"You really have to shorten up your swing, and it was basically battle mode," he said. "He threw me a fastball and I took an emergency swing, and the ball went out."	Miller (3-2) gave up a tiebreaking home run for the second straight night. The left-hander, who has been virtually unhittable, allowed a leadoff homer to Cody Bellinger in the eighth -- the first he gave up this season -- that broke a tie in the Dodgers' 7-5 win Tuesday.	Indians manager Terry Francona understands why people are surprised to see Miller struggle.	"He has been so good, like incredibly good, that when he gives up a run, everybody kind of like ... but he'll be fine," Francona said.	Miller was charged with four runs in 2/3 of an inning after throwing 25 pitches Tuesday and the Indians (31-31) dropped to .500 for the first time since April 19.	"We think we're a better team than this (and) I think I'm a better pitcher than I've been the last two nights," Miller said.	"Kike has had some real good at-bats lately, so for him to be able to get a big hit off Miller -- one of the best in baseball -- it's big," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.	Josh Fields (3-0) allowed Jose Ramirez's game-tying home run in the seventh. Kenley Jansen worked the ninth for his 13th save and second of the series as the Dodgers won their sixth straight.	Francona returned to the dugout after being hospitalized for a few hours Tuesday night. He underwent a battery of tests and was released early Wednesday.	Dodgers outfielder Yasiel Puig was in the lineup after appealing his one-game suspension by Major League Baseball for making an obscene gesture to Indians fans on Tuesday night.	Puig, also fined for the incident, was booed in each at-bat and his two strikeouts brought some of the biggest cheers of the night.	Corey Kluber of the Indians gave up four hits and struck out 10 in seven innings but allowed two runs in the second, a rally that consisted of a walk, a double, two infield hits and Chris Taylor's steal of home that occurred on the back end of a double steal.	Taylor also had a two-run single in the eighth.	Dodgers starter Brandon McCarthy was charged with one run in 5 1/3 innings.	UNUSUAL NUMBERS	The teams' bullpen have combined to allow 15 runs through the first two games.	"That's the beautiful thing about baseball," Roberts said. "Coming in, I was looking forward to a battle of the bullpens. The way Tito is managing Cleveland, it's like the postseason. I wouldn't mind seeing him in October."	NICE NUMBER	Kluber recorded his 1,000th strikeout and became the fastest pitcher in team history to reach that mark. The right-hander also recorded the 27th double-figure strikeout game of his career.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: LHP Julio Urias (left shoulder irritation) was placed on the DL at Triple-A Oklahoma City. He was 0-2 with a 5.40 ERA in five starts for Los Angeles.	Indians: 2B Jason Kipnis (neck spasms) was scratched from the lineup and replaced by Erik Gonzalez.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: LHP Rich Hill is 1-0 with a 2.57 ERA in three road starts this season. He made 63 relief appearances for Cleveland in 2013.	Indians: RHP Josh Tomlin is tied for the major league lead with eight losses to go with three wins.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DETROIT --  Taijuan Walker felt fresh after nearly a month off, although it took a little while for him to settle into a groove.	"I don't know why I was so nervous," the Arizona right-hander said. "First game back, maybe, but after the first inning, I felt a lot better, more comfortable."	Walker pitched five sharp innings in his return from the disabled list, and the Diamondbacks won their fourth straight game, 2-1 over the Detroit Tigers on Wednesday night.	Arizona scored two runs in the first inning, and that turned out to be all the Diamondbacks needed.	Walker (5-3) allowed a run and six hits in his first appearance since May 19 . He had been out because of a blister on his right index finger.	"I thought Taijuan was very good," manager Torey Lovullo said. "First day back, it was all very encouraging. He got to the pitch count that we wanted him to get to, and gave us five really, really good innings, and the rest of the guys picked it up from there."	Walker was lifted after 82 pitches, then Randall Delgado pitched three scoreless innings of relief. Fernando Rodney struck out the side in the ninth for his 18th save in 21 chances.	Jordan Zimmermann (5-5) allowed two runs and six hits in eight innings.	Arizona is 9-1 in interleague play this season. The lone defeat was at home May 10 against Detroit.	The Diamondbacks took the lead right away against Zimmermann. Gregor Blanco led off the game with a single to left that got past Justin Upton for an error. Blanco went all the way to third on the play and scored on David Peralta's sacrifice fly. Brandon Drury added an RBI single, but Upton redeemed himself by throwing Chris Owings out at the plate.	Detroit was hitless until the third, when Ian Kinsler managed a two-out double and scored on Alex Avila's single.	Walker struck out six and walked one, and Zimmermann was impressive as well. After Chris Hermann's single to start the second, Arizona didn't have another baserunner until the seventh.	"The first inning, I gave up four hits, I believe," Zimmermann said. "A little blooper and three ground balls that got through the hole. Other than that, I felt like my stuff was the best it's been in a Tigers' uniform."	It was the third straight quality start for Zimmermann and the first time this year he had gone more than six innings. He struck out six without a walk and lowered his ERA to 5.35.	IMPRESSIVE PACE	Arizona (41-26) matched the franchise's best start through 67 games and remained a half-game out of first place in the NL West.	"We're winning one-run games on the road, and I think that's what teams do when they play into the end of the season and have meaningful games," Lovullo said. "We're doing a lot of things right. I'm very pleased with that."	WHIFFS	The Tigers struck out 11 times in the game and drew only one walk.	"You feel like you can scrape out a couple runs, but we didn't tonight," Detroit manager Brad Ausmus said. "You feel like you wasted an outing, but there's not much we can do about it."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: After a one-out walk to Avila in the first, Walker committed an obvious balk when he began his motion to the plate but didn't release the ball. It looked awkward, but he was able to continue and there was no sign of an injury.	"My cleat got caught in the ground, and I just lost my footing," Walker said.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: Arizona has Thursday off before starting a three-game series at Philadelphia. LHP Patrick Corbin (5-6) starts Friday night for the Diamondbacks against RHP Aaron Nola (3-4).	Tigers: Detroit begins a four-game series at home against Tampa Bay on Thursday night. RHP Justin Verlander (4-4) takes the mound for the Tigers against RHP Alex Cobb (5-5).	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	---	Follow Noah Trister at www.Twitter.com/noahtrister	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.

NEW YORK --  On a night when Matt Harvey fizzled and so much went wrong for the New York Mets, they still rallied late for a rousing win.	Curtis Granderson opened a five-run eighth inning with his 300th homer, a tiebreaking shot that helped the Mets bail out an ailing Harvey in a 9-4 victory Wednesday over the Chicago Cubs.	Harvey lost the zip on his fastball and gave up three homers in four innings -- including Anthony Rizzo's latest leadoff shot and a titanic drive by Kyle Schwarber . After the game, the former ace said he's at a pretty low point physically and plans to see a doctor Thursday.	"My arm was just not working at all," said Harvey, who had a rib removed last year during surgery for thoracic outlet syndrome. "I think the last time I threw 87 (mph) with a fastball was probably freshman year of high school."	"It's been very difficult. A very difficult year," he added. "A lot of ups and downs. A lot of discomfort and trying to battle through weaknesses and strengthening areas that I'm not used to. It's been rough. I have one less rib. I had pretty major surgery. There's going to be discomfort with that."	New York also lost second baseman Neil Walker to a left leg injury , the latest issue to befall a team hampered by a long list of health problems the past two seasons. But replacement Lucas Duda hit a three-run homer off Hector Rondon in the eighth, and T.J. Rivera capped the outburst with an RBI single for his third hit.	With sluggers Yoenis Cespedes and Michael Conforto on the bench to begin the game, the resurgent Mets came back from a 4-1 deficit and took two of three from the World Series champions heading into a pivotal four-game series against NL East-leading Washington. New York (30-34) has won five of six overall.	"This is a big win for us, especially going into tomorrow night," manager Terry Collins said.	Granderson received a standing ovation and came out for a curtain call after connecting in the eighth off Carl Edwards Jr. (2-1). The veteran outfielder had the souvenir ball from home run No. 300 in his locker after the game.	Jerry Blevins (4-0) struck out three of his four batters, and Addison Reed retired Rizzo with the bases loaded for the final out.	Juan Lagares hit a tying triple on an 0-2 pitch from Pedro Strop with two outs in the sixth, the start of a meltdown by Chicago's bullpen.	The Cubs (32-33) hit back-to-back homers to begin the game but played some sloppy defense and lost for the eighth time in their past nine visits to Citi Field, including the 2015 NL Championship Series.	"There's a certain unpredictability about us. That's why we're a .500 ballclub right now," manager Joe Maddon said. "I believe in our group, but we have to prove it on the field. Very simple."	Chicago has dropped six of eight following a five-game winning streak.	"We developed guys last year and won the World Series. No team has ever done that, I don't think," Rizzo said. "So, you've got to take your lumps."	Cubs rookie Ian Happ, who hit a grand slam Tuesday night, followed Rizzo's leadoff shot with his seventh home run and Chicago had a 2-0 lead after seven pitches. Schwarber's 467-foot shot over the Shea Bridge, a walkway for Citi Field fans above and beyond the bullpens in right-center, made it 4-1 in the fourth.	LEADING MAN	Batting leadoff Tuesday for the first time in his career, Rizzo homered on Zack Wheeler's second pitch to spark a 14-3 rout by the Cubs. The 240-pound slugger did himself one better this time, connecting on the first pitch from Harvey and prompting excited high-fives from giddy teammates in the dugout. "I am statistically the greatest leadoff hitter of all-time," Rizzo said. "I would like to retire there just to talk smack to everyone that tries to do it."	BIG STICK	With the bases loaded in the fourth and the Mets short on the bench, Collins sent up pitcher Steven Matz to pinch hit for Harvey. Matz legged out an RBI infield single off starter Mike Montgomery, and Lagares trimmed it to 4-3 with a sacrifice fly.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: 2B-OF Ben Zobrist (left wrist) was out of the lineup for the second consecutive game but available to pinch hit, Maddon said. After a day off Thursday, the team hopes Zobrist can start Friday night in Pittsburgh. If not, the disabled list could become a consideration. ... RHP Kyle Hendricks (hand tendinitis) was scheduled to have a second MRI.	Mets: Walker pulled up lame trying to beat out a bunt in the third inning and will have an MRI on Thursday. Duda entered in the fourth at first base, with Rivera shifting from first to second. And it appears the Mets once again will hold off on calling up hot-hitting shortstop prospect Amed Rosario from Triple-A Las Vegas: Second baseman Gavin Cecchini was scratched from the 51s lineup after Walker got hurt.	UP NEXT	Cubs: Begin a three-game series Friday night in Pittsburgh with RHP Eddie Butler (3-2, 4.03 ERA) on the mound against Pirates rookie RHP Trevor Williams (3-3, 5.13).	Mets: With the Mets using a six-man rotation during a long stretch between days off, rookie RHP Robert Gsellman (5-3, 4.95 ERA) gets another start Thursday night in the series opener against Washington. Gsellman threw 6 2/3 shutout innings Saturday in Atlanta and has won a career-best three straight outings. He faces Nationals LHP Gio Gonzalez (5-1, 2.91), who is 9-1 with a 1.62 ERA in 14 starts at Citi Field -- including a 3-1 win over Jacob deGrom on April 22 during Washington's three-game sweep.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

CHICAGO --  The Baltimore Orioles kept insisting they would turn things around and break out of their slump. Maybe this is a start.	Welington Castillo hit his first career grand slam and drove in a personal-best five runs, and the Orioles snapped a six-game losing streak with a rain-delayed 10-6 victory over the Chicago White Sox on Wednesday night.	Castillo gave the Orioles an 8-5 lead with his drive against Miguel Gonzalez (4-8) in the fifth inning and helped prevent them from matching their longest slide of the season. Baltimore also evened its record at 32-32 after falling below .500 for the first time since Oct. 3, 2015.	"We needed a win, we got one today and hopefully we can keep it rolling," Dylan Bundy said.	The Orioles have been struggling since a 22-10 start.	Things weren't looking good for them early on, after Matt Davidson homered in his third straight game to help Chicago grab a 5-1 lead. But the Orioles turned this one around, pounding out 13 hits and overcoming two errors on the way to a lopsided victory.	Trey Mancini had a double and two singles. He scored three runs and drove in one.	Mark Trumbo added two hits and two runs, and a shaky Dylan Bundy (7-5) got the support he needed. The right-hander picked up the win after going 1-4 in his previous six starts. He gave up five runs and six hits in five innings.	Gonzalez got pounded for eight runs -- matching his highest total since June 25, 2016 -- and nine hits over five innings. The right-hander is 1-8 in his past nine starts.	"I've been there before and I've had success," he said. "Right now I'm struggling. I just have to keep working between my starts and hopefully everything will turn around."	The game was delayed 90 minutes at the start. And after getting outscored a combined 16-8 by the White Sox over the previous two games, the Orioles looked like they might get blown out again.	They jumped into it by scoring three in the fourth, with Hyun Soo Kim's two-run single cutting it to 5-4. Castillo got caught in a rundown between second and third on the play for the third out, but did he ever make up for it in the fifth.	Gonzalez retired the first two batters before giving up singles to Trumbo and Mancini and walking Jonathan Schoop. That brought up Castillo, whose towering grand slam to the bushes beyond the center-field wall gave the Orioles an 8-5 lead.	"(Castillo) has had had a track record of that for awhile," manager Buck Showalter said. "You always wonder how numbers are going to translate from league to league. He had to learn a lot of new hitters and new pitchers. ... He's been a quick study. Very easy to pull for, really good teammate."	GOING DEEP	Chicago's Alen Hanson hit his first career homer in the ninth, but the Orioles got the win they needed.	DAVIS TO DL	The Orioles placed slugging first baseman Chris Davis on the 10-day disabled list because of a strained right oblique. Davis -- batting .226 with 14 homers and 26 RBI -- exited Monday's loss to Chicago.  He had trouble sleeping Tuesday night and probably won't start treatment for a few days, manager Buck Showalter said.	The Orioles selected infielder David Washington's contract from Triple-A Norfolk and transferred outfielder Anthony Santander from the 10-day to the 60-day DL because of a strained right forearm.	MINAYA SENT DOWN	The White Sox optioned Juan Minaya to Triple-A Charlotte after the game. He has an 8.10 ERA in seven relief appearances.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: Manager Buck Showalter held OF Seth Smith out of the lineup for the second straight game because he's "not 100 percent," though he wouldn't say what the issue was.	White Sox: James Shields is ready to return to the Chicago White Sox's rotation. The 35-year-old right-hander is scheduled to start Sunday at Toronto after being sidelined the past two months because of a strained right back muscle.	UP NEXT	The Orioles and White Sox wrap up a four-game series, with RHP Chris Tillman (1-4, 8.01 ERA) starting for Baltimore and LHP David Holmberg (1-0, 2.74)  pitching for Chicago.	---	More AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Mike Zunino may wish he could face the Minnesota Twins every game.	The Seattle catcher hit a three-run homer in the third inning, his fourth home run against the Twins since June 7, and the Mariners' bullpen held off a late threat to win 6-4 Wednesday night.	Zunino's home run off the facing of the upper deck gave the Mariners a 5-0 lead and continued the tear the 26-year-old has been on since being recalled from the minors in late May.	Since May 29, Zunino is hitting .396 with five home runs, including a walk-off against the Twins at Safeco Field a week ago and Wednesday night's third-inning blast.	"Zunino hit that ball about as hard as he could hit it," Seattle manager Scott Servais said.	After toying with his swing in the minor leagues, Zunino has returned with a new approach and has reestablished himself as the everyday catcher.	"This is something that I only started about a month and a half ago," Zunino said, "so I'm still trying to fine tune everything -- keep everything ironed out."	Mitch Haniger hit a two-run homer in the first inning off Ervin Santana, who gave up a season-high nine hits just one game removed from a complete-game shutout in San Francisco. Santana (8-4) lasted five innings, his second-shortest start of the year. It was the fourth time this season the Twins ace has allowed five or more runs.	"I think Ervin will tell you that he had to battle tonight," Twins manager Paul Molitor said. "He probably didn't have as good a feel for his slider as he did his last game out."	The Twins chipped away at the early 5-0 deficit, however, and knocked Mariners starter Sam Gaviglio out of the game with three home runs in a two-inning stretch. Eduardo Escobar and Byron Buxton hit solo homers in the fifth inning, then Miguel Sano added a two-run homer in the sixth after the Mariners scored an unearned run in the top of the inning. Sano's 16th home run knocked out Gaviglio (3-1) after 5 1/3 innings and gave way to a bullpen that had given up 11 runs the night before.	It was a different story on Wednesday as four Seattle relievers combined for 3 2/3 scoreless innings, ending with a four-out save from Eddie Diaz, who forced a flyout from Brian Dozier with two outs and two men on in the bottom of the ninth.	"Big for us," Diaz said.	Ben Gamel added three hits for the Mariners and made a highlight-reel catch in the eighth inning on a foul ball down the left-field line. Robinson Cano also recorded three hits.	But it was Zunino, the No. 8 hitter, who delivered the early blow the Twins couldn't recover from.	"I'm happy for him," Servais said. "Made some major changes in his swing. He's getting results. Hope it continues for a long time."	ROSTER MOVES	The Twins re-signed RHP Drew Rucinski to Triple-A Rochester before the game Wednesday after designating him for assignment three days earlier. Rucinski has made two relief appearances for the team this year.	The Mariners also made a pregame move, recalling RHP Chase De Jong to join the bullpen and optioned RHP Casey Lawrence to Triple-A Tacoma.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: SS Jean Segura (right ankle sprain) did agility drills and took batting practice before the game Wednesday. According to Servais, the team will know within a couple of days whether Segura will need a rehab assignment. Servais had hoped to get his shortstop off the 10-day DL at some point during the Mariners' upcoming weekend series in Texas but admitted it may take a bit longer.	Twins: LHP Hector Santiago (strained left shoulder) will throw a side session on Thursday to see if he'll be ready in time for the Twins' doubleheader against the Cleveland Indians on Saturday. Molitor indicated the team has several options for a spot starter if Santiago can't appear, though he ruled out long reliever Tyler Duffey.	UP NEXT	Mariners: LHP Ariel Miranda (6-2) takes the mound in Thursday's matinee to conclude the four-game series. He has not allowed more than two earned runs in any of his last six starts.	Twins: RHP Jose Berrios (5-1) aims for his third win in a row. He led the Twins to two victories on their recent West Coast trip, allowing two earned runs in each start.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

HOUSTON --  Derek Fisher didn't have to wait too long to collect his first major league hit.	The wait for No. 2 was even shorter.	Fisher homered and had an RBI single for his first major league hits in a nine-run sixth inning to help the Houston Astros to a 13-2 victory over the Texas Rangers on Wednesday night to avoid a three-game sweep.	"Something you can dream of," he said. "I can't say that I would expect to have something like that my first night. But definitely happy that it happened."	The Astros led by three with no outs in the sixth when Fisher, who made his debut on Wednesday, connected off Jeremy Jeffress for a solo home run to the seats in left field. Two pitches later, Jake Marisnick hit a pitch into nearly the same spot to extend the lead to 6-1.	Houston had pushed the lead to 10-1 when Fisher came up again with two outs in the inning. This time he laced a single to right field to send another run home.	"It's a tall task to ask the team to get a guy up twice (in one inning) in his debut," manager A.J. Hinch said.	Fisher is the first player to get the first two hits of his career in the same inning since Adam Laroche did it for the Braves on April 7, 2004.	But the Astros weren't done scoring in that inning yet. Dillon Gee plunked Marisnick before George Springer added a two-run double to make it 13-1. The Rangers finally escaped the sixth when the 13th batter of the inning, pinch-hitter Alex Bregman, grounded out.	Houston's top prospect Francis Martes (1-0) allowed three hits and one run while fanning seven in five innings in his first major league start.	Rangers starter Andrew Cashner (3-6) yielded 10 hits and four runs in 4-plus innings for the loss.	Joey Gallo hit his 18th home run on a 466-foot shot to straightaway center field in the seventh for the Rangers, whose five-game winning streak was snapped.	"It was a 5-1 road trip that didn't quite end the way we wanted it to, but I think we still got some good momentum going home," manager Jeff Banister said.	Marwin Gonzalez drove in three runs and Brian McCann and Carlos Beltran added two RBI apiece for the Astros.	Houston took a 1-0 lead on a groundout by Carlos Correa in the first. McCann doubled to start the second and the Astros extended their lead to 2-0 when he scored on a single by Gonzalez.	Martes sailed through the first four innings, retiring 12 of the first 14 batters he faced. He ran into trouble in the fifth when Jonathan Lucroy started the inning with a single. Martes then walked Gallo before plunking Jurickson Profar.	Martes struck out Jared Hoying before Lucroy scored on a wild pitch to cut the lead to 2-1. Delino DeShields drew a walk to load the bases again, but Martes retired the next two batters to escape the jam.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: LHP Cole Hamels, who has been out since May 3 with a strained right oblique, could begin a rehabilitation assignment with Double-A Frisco as soon as Friday. ... OF Carlos Gomez (right hamstring strain) went 0 for 3 in a rehabilitation start at Frisco on Wednesday night. He is likely to come off the DL on Friday.	Astros: Fisher was called up when OF Josh Reddick was placed on the 7-day concussion list on Wednesday, retroactive to Tuesday. Reddick was injured when he crashed into the wall trying to make a catch on Monday night.	THEY SAID IT	Banister on Gallo's home run: "That one was real far. I'm not sure I've seen one go that far in this ballpark (but) they don't give you extra points for long ones."	UP NEXT	Rangers: Texas is off on Thursday before Tyson Ross will make his debut for the Rangers on Friday when the team opens a three-game series against the Mariners. Ross has been out all season after having thoracic outlet surgery in October.	Astros: Houston also has a day off on Thursday before opening a three-game series against Boston on Friday with Mike Fiers (4-2, 4.29 ERA) on the mound. Fiers allowed two hits and no earned runs in a season-high 7 1/3 innings in a 3-1 win over the Angels on Saturday.	---	More AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

ST. LOUIS --  Eric Thames would like to erase the last six weeks from his memory.	The Milwaukee Brewers infielder took a big step in that direction on Wednesday. Thames homered and drove in three runs, Matt Garza pitched five innings in his first start after a short stint on the disabled list, and the Brewers held on to beat the St. Louis Cardinals 7-6.	Eric Sogard added a two-run double to lead a four-run second inning as Milwaukee improved to 18-13 on the road.	Thames came into the contest in a 1-for-15 skid. He was hitting just .108 in June and posted a .221 mark in May. Signed as a free agent in November after three seasons in Korea, Thames was one of the hottest hitters in the National League in April and set a franchise record with 11 home runs.	But May and June have not been that kind.	"The last month and a half, it's just been a grind," Thames said. "But that's baseball. I'm going to keep fighting, keep plugging away, keep adjusting."	Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell was happy to see Thames break out.	"Two big hits, he got us out to a big lead," Counsell said.	Aledmys Diaz hit a two-run homer for the Cardinals, who nearly recovered after falling behind 6-0. St. Louis has lost two in a row after winning four straight.	Closer Corey Knebel came on with two outs in the top of the eighth after a one-hour rain delay and got the last four outs for his 10th save in 13 chances.	Thames ripped a two-run homer in the first and an RBI double in the second against starter Mike Leake (5-6).	Garza (3-2) allowed four runs and five hits. He suffered a chest contusion while running into teammate Jesus Aguilar on June 3 and missed one start.	"I was just telling myself, "slow down, catch your breath, keep going," Garza said. "They barreled a lot more balls up than I wanted them to. But that's the nature of the beast."	Milwaukee tallied six runs on six hits over the first two innings against Leake, who dropped his fourth successive decision. Leake bounced back with four scoreless innings after the rough start.	"He figured it out and sailed," St. Louis manager Mike Matheny said.	Diaz's blast off reliever Jacob Barnes in the eighth brought St. Louis to 7-6.	The contest was delayed twice by rain, with the delays totaling 1 hour, 50 minutes.	FIRST INNING MAGIC	The Cardinals had given up a total of just two runs in the opening inning during their first 34 home games. Thames doubled that total with his two-run homer.	WONG REMOVED	St. Louis INF Kolten Wong was removed before the sixth inning due to right forearm tightness.	Wong, who went 1 for 2, has hit safely in six consecutive games since coming off the disabled list June 6 with a left elbow strain.	"He was favoring it, he couldn't really throw," St. Louis manager Mike Matheny said. "I think it happened on (a) check swing. We'll have him looked at closely."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: RHP Garza was removed from the 10-day disabled list in time for the start. RHP Neftali Feliz was designated for assignment to make room for Garza.	Cardinals: LHP Marco Gonzales was returned to Triple-A Memphis after he started the second game of the day-night doubleheader on Tuesday. Gonzales gave up five runs on six hits in 3 1/3 innings.	UP NEXT	Brewers: RHP Zach Davies (7-3, 4.74) will start in the final game of the four-game series on Thursday. Davies is 2-0 with a 2.81 ERA in five career starts against St. Louis.	Cardinals: RHP Michael Wacha (3-3, 4.50) will start for the Cardinals in the finale game of a seven-game homestand. Wacha has gone six innings or more in eight of 11 starts this season. He has a 4-0 career mark against the Brewers.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Andrelton Simmons as known as one of the finest defensive shortstops in the majors, though that hardly means he doesn't enjoy swinging the bat well.	The Angels shortstop enjoyed his offensive output plenty Wednesday night, drilling a two-run homer in the seventh to snap a tie game and lead Los Angeles to a 7-5 victory over the New York Yankees.	"It's nice to contribute offensively," Simmons said.	Simmons fell to one knee to hit his seventh home run and ruin the major league debut of New York right-hander Ronald Herrera (0-1).	"I was on it the whole way, but it just kept going lower and I wanted to stay with it," he said.	Danny Espinosa also hit a two-run homer for the Angels, and Gary Sanchez a three-run shot for the Yankees.	Blake Parker (2-2) earned the victory in relief. Angels starter Matt Shoemaker left the game in the fourth inning with what the team called tightness of his right forearm extensor muscle.	"I'm just really annoyed and frustrated by it," Shoemaker said. "I'm not really concerned about it at all."	Powered by the Sanchez three-run homer, the Yankees scored four times in the first but could add only one other run the rest of the night.	After winning six consecutive games, the Yankees dropped the last two and the series to the Angels.	"We had chances to win every game," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "We had a lot of opportunities tonight. We just didn't get it done."	Yankees shortstop Didi Gregorius' infield single in the fourth pushed his career-high hitting streak to 16 games.	PINEDA GRINDS	Michael Pineda started for the Yankees and gave up four runs in the first three innings, before settling down to go six innings. He allowed five runs on 10 hits and a walk.	"He struggled with his command," Girardi said. "I wasn't sure he'd last three innings. But he battled and gave us six."	ANGELS BULLPEN	After Shoemaker was forced to exit the game with no outs in the fourth, the Angels bullpen held the Yankees to one run over the last six innings. Parker Bridwell, Blake Parker and Hernandez held New York without an earned run.	"That was the story of the game," said Angels manager Mike Scioscia. "That's a powerful lineup. What they did was truly extraordinary."	YANKEES BULLPEN	The Yankees used six relief pitchers Tuesday night when Sabathia was injured and needed Pineda and Herrera to come through Wednesday.	"It was really about all I had," Girardi said. "I can't hurt people."	YOUNG DEFENSE	Young did more than just contribute with his bat. He made two strong defensive plays to help contain Yankees rookie sensation Aaron Judge. Young threw him out at the plate in the fifth and made a diving catch of a Judge line drive with two on in the seventh.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: LHP CC Sabathia was diagnosed with a Grade 2 left hamstring strain and could be out at least four weeks. . Closer Aroldis Chapman (shoulder inflammation) threw a 22-pitch simulated game in Florida, the team concerned the Single-A game would again be rained out. He is scheduled make a final rehab appearance for Double-A Trenton on Friday and then activated Sunday.	Angels: Reliever Huston Street (right lat strain) could only manage one out in his rehab outing for Single-A Inland Empire Wednesday. He surrendered two hits, two walks and three runs. . Reliever Cam Bedrosian (right groin strain) is scheduled to pitch for the Inland Empire Thursday. If it goes well, he is expected to be activated by Saturday.	SABATHIA WATCH	Girardi wasn't about to speculate when his ace would be able to return.	"He'll be ready when he's ready," Girardi said. "With a pitcher (hamstrings) are a little bit tougher, because they can't throw.	UP NEXT	Yankees: LHP Jordan Montgomery (4-4, 3.55 ERA) is scheduled to open a four-game series in Oakland. The rookie hopes to continue his recent turnaround. After going 2/3 with a 4.81 ERA in his first seven starts, he's gone 2-1 with a 1.50 ERA in his last four starts.	Angels: Struggling right-hander Ricky Nolasco (2-7, 4.81 ERA) will be looking for his first victory since April 27 when he opens a four-game series at home against the Kansas City Royals. In eight career starts against the Royals, he is 2-4 with a 4.80 ERA.	---	https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

CLEVELAND -- �� Lonnie Chisenhall usually senses when Indians manager Terry Francona is going to call on him as a pinch-hitter.	That moment came earlier than normal for Chisenhall on Thursday, and he was ready.	Chisenhall connected for a three-run, pinch-hit homer in the fifth inning and had five RBIs as Cleveland salvaged the finale of a three-game series by beating Los Angeles 12-5 and stopping the Dodgers' six-game winning streak.	After the Dodgers closed to 5-4 in the fifth, Chisenhall hit a 415-foot drive on the second pitch from Ross Stripling to open a four-run lead for Josh Tomlin (4-8), who struggled after being staked to a 5-0 lead.	Chisenhall added a two-run single in the sixth, making him just the third Cleveland player since 1913 to come off the bench and record five RBIs or more.	"Tito finds those good situations for guys and you try to not read his mind," Chisenhall said of Francona. "But I've done it for long enough that we're kind of on the same page."	Francona joked that he probably should have started Chisenhall, "but I'm not very smart." He and bench coach Brad Mills debated whether to have Austin Jackson bunt or bring up Chisenhall, a left-hander, to face Stripling.	"You want to tack on, but then we're bunting for the bottom of the order," Francona said. "Millsy kind of pushed me in that direction. Boy, Lonnie took a beautiful swing."	Edwin Encarnacion homered off Rich Hill (3-3), reached base five times and scored four runs as Cleveland moved back over .500 with just its second win in 11 interleague games.	Rookie Cody Bellinger homered again for the Dodgers. He touched up Tomlin for a line-drive homer in the fourth, his 18th home run in 47 games. Only New York Yankees catcher Gary Sanchez hit more through 47 games, slugging 19.	"I don't know what else there is to say," Dodgers manager Dave Robert said of his 21-year-old first baseman. "I've tried to use all the ways to describe him. The home runs and the production are just a by-product of his care in wanting to be a great baseball player and helping us to win games."	Tomlin got help from Cleveland's offense and did just enough to cool off the Dodgers, who were in a five-run hole after two innings but closed within a run in the fifth on Yasiel Puig's RBI double and Chris Taylor's two-run homer.	Hill, who was facing the Indians for the first time since leaving as a free after the 2013 season, walked Encarnacion opening the fifth and was pulled for Stripling after Carlos Santana singled.	Chisenhall took one pitch before sending his eighth homer, and second as a pinch-hitter, into the seats in right to make it 8-4.	"It's an adrenaline rush going up there, especially it's always a crunch-time situation," Chisenhall said, "so you want to go up there and make sure you're taking hacks that are going to help the team."	The Indians added three runs with two outs in the sixth on Chisenhall's single and Roberto Perez's broken-bat blooper.	Tomlin is impressed with Chisenhall's ability to come off the bench and deliver.	"He's an intelligent player," Tomlin said. "He's been around for a little while. He pays attention to the game and he knows when his number is going to be called, they do a good job of letting him know. He's a good player, that's what good players do."

"He's starting to look a lot like himself," Francona said. "He's taking a lot of good swings. It's nice to get him going."	ROSTER SHUFFLE	Francona didn't have second baseman Jason Kipnis (stiff neck) or Michael Brantley, who was with his wife, Melissa, as the couple is expecting its fourth child. Francona said Brantley will go on the paternity list and the Indians will make other roster moves this weekend, when they play a double-header in Minnesota.	ROTATION SHUFFLE	Roberts said right-hander Kenta Maeda will start Sunday in Cincinnati, bumping back Clayton Kershaw to pitch Monday against the New York Mets.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: 1B Adrian Gonzalez received a second opinion on his back injury, which confirmed he has a herniated disc. He'll likely receive an epidural. LHP Julio Urias (shoulder inflammation) has been shut down indefinitely. The 20-year-old phenom is on the disabled list at Triple-A Oklahoma City after being up with the Dodgers earlier.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: Stay in Ohio and open a three-game series in Cincinnati with Alex Wood (6-0) starting for the second time against the Reds since June 10.	Indians: Carlos Carrasco starts the opener of a four-game series at first-place Minnesota. The right-hander is 4-1 with a 3.13 ERA in six road outings this season.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

MINNEAPOLIS --  After going deep twice in a game for the first time in his big league career, Chris Gimenez still has more mop-up relief appearances this season than home runs.	Wait, maybe the Minnesota Twins have this whole thing backward with their backup catcher.	"Hopefully I'm one of the better hitting pitchers in the league," Gimenez said with a wide smile, after his pair of drives on Thursday spurred the Twins to a 6-2 victory over the Seattle Mariners.	Eduardo Escobar sparked a five-run first inning with a two-run shot, and Jose Berrios (6-1) took over from there by pitching a career-best eight innings to win his third straight start. The first-place Twins raised their home record, the worst in the major leagues, to 14-20 with the four-game series split.	Gimenez hit a three-run homer with two outs in the fateful first for Ariel Miranda (6-3), who lost for the first time in 10 starts for the Mariners and lasted only four innings with 10 hits and six runs allowed. Gimenez then hit the foul pole in left field with a solo drive in the third inning, giving the 34-year-old a total of 18 home runs in 867 plate appearances.	"I had to talk to it a little bit as I was running to first," Gimenez said.	His conversations with Berrios throughout the afternoon turned out well, too, driving a strategy to mix in some changeups with a lively fastball that the right-hander spotted well and that devastating curveball.	"We had chances to kind of get close but could never mount the big rally against him," Mariners manager Scott Servais said.	Berrios struck out six and yielded two runs and five hits. After finishing six innings only once in 14 starts as a rookie last season on his way to an 8.02 ERA, Berrios has lasted that long in five of seven turns this year.	"I was blessed to be able to go as far as I did today," he said through the team's interpreter.	Berrios silenced a lineup that totaled 45 hits and 27 runs over the first three games of the series, handing the Mariners just their sixth loss in the last 18 games.	"Sometimes it takes them awhile to get comfortable and trust what they can do up here," Twins manager Paul Molitor said. "We all never really lost hope that he was going to figure it out."	GAMEL KEEPS GOING	Ben Gamel and Robinson Cano had RBI singles for the Mariners, with Gamel stretching his hitting streak to seven straight games. He's 15 for 30 with five doubles during the run and has reached base 14 times in his last 24 plate appearances.	CONTINUING ED	Escobar has three homers in the last five games. He went 3 for 4 and is batting .362 with four home runs and 12 RBI against left-handers this season. In his last eight games overall, Escobar is 18 for 31 with eight RBI.	MIRANDA NOT RIGHT	With fellow starters Felix Hernandez, Hisashi Iwakuma and Drew Smyly on the disabled list and James Paxton just recently coming off of it, Miranda has been a key cog in Seattle's rotation.	He was 5-0 in his last nine starts, with six straight turns of two or fewer runs allowed, until this dud that began with a leadoff double by Brian Dozier. Mitch Haniger had a reasonable opportunity to catch it on the warning track, but the ball veered away at the end of its journey and eluded his glove. Escobar followed with a home run, his third in five games.	Miranda, the 28-year-old acquired last summer in a trade with Baltimore for Wade Miley, has allowed 11 homers with a 6.56 ERA in eight starts on the road. This time he went to the off-speed pitches too quickly.	"He's got to keep throwing his fastball until you get a feel for it, because that's his pitch," Servais said. "That sets up everything else."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: SS Jean Segura (sprained right ankle) could play a rehab game for Triple-A Tacoma this weekend and be back in the lineup as soon as next week. ... Iwakuma made his first rehab start for Class A Modesto on Wednesday, finishing four scoreless innings with one hit allowed.	Twins: LHP Hector Santiago (sore left shoulder) threw a bullpen session, but the Twins picked Adam Wilk to join Adalberto Mejia as the starters for the split doubleheader on Saturday instead of taking Santiago off the 10-day DL. Wilk will be recalled from Triple-A Rochester as the 26th player for the day.	UP NEXT	Mariners: Paxton (5-1, 2.25 ERA) starts on Friday to begin a series at Texas. For the Rangers, RHP Tyson Ross will make his season debut.	Twins: LHP Nik Turley (0-0, 9.00 ERA) takes the mound on Friday to open a series against Cleveland. RHP Carlos Carrasco (6-3, 3.36 ERA) starts for the Indians.	---	More AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

CHICAGO --  Rookie Matt Davidson keeps powering the Chicago White Sox.	Davidson homered for the fourth straight game, then doubled and scored in a four-run sixth inning to lead Chicago over Baltimore 5-2 on Thursday, the Orioles' seventh loss in eight games.	Davidson hit a solo homer in the fourth, his 14th home run this season. He became the first White Sox player to go deep in four straight games since Alex Rios in April 2013.	Davidson broke his right foot while running the bases in his White Sox debut last June 30 and missed the remainder of the season.	"I think I'm just maturing as a player and understanding my swing a little better," Davidson said. "We made some pretty drastic swing changes two years ago going into `16, and I had a lot of time to reflect on what to improve as I was rehabbing last offseason."	Chicago manager Rick Renteria has used the 26-year-old mostly at designated hitter.	"He's been able to drive the ball out of the ballpark," Renteria said. "He's been able to get to pitches he can handle."	Caleb Joseph's RBI double in the fifth tied the score 1-1, but Melky Cabrera hit a two-run single in the sixth that chased Chris Tillman (1-5).	Chicago opened a 5-1 lead when Jimmy Yacabonis, making his third big league appearance, loaded the bases with a four-pitch walk to Tim Anderson, threw a head-high 3-2 pitch for ball four to Jose Abreu and allowed Leury Garcia's sacrifice fly.	Anthony Swarzak (3-1) allowed two hits in 1 2/3 scoreless innings to win in relief of David Holmberg, who gave up four hits in 4 1/3 innings. David Robertson allowed Welington Castillo's ninth-inning homer, his second in two games.	Chicago took three of four games in the series.	Tillman lost his fifth straight start, allowing five runs and 11 hits in 5 1/3 innings. The right-hander has been pounded for 28 runs and 40 hits over 20 1/3 innings during his skid, raising his ERA to 8.07.	In his previous outing, on Saturday against the Yankeees, Tillman allowed a career-high nine runs in 1 1/3 innings.	"Yeah, I think it was much better," Tillman said. "Pitch here and there could've been better, but for the most part it was a step in the right direction."	Baltimore's ace last season at 16-6, Tillman missed spring training this year and started the season on the disabled list with shoulder bursitis. He beat the White Sox on May 7 in his first game this season.	"Chris has got a good track record, and he's going to pitch better," manager Buck Showalter said.	Avisail Garcia, who entered hitting an AL-leading .339, had two singles in three at-bats to extend his hitting streak to eight games before being ejected in the fifth after first base umpire Paul Emmel ruled he didn't check his swing on an 0-2 pitch in the dirt.	Garcia raised his arms and pointed to his right eye with his left hand, earning his ejection. Renteria came out to argue and also was tossed.	"I'm sure I'll hear about it," Renteria said.	Garcia was thrown out of a game for the first time in his big league career and Renteria was booted for the second time this season and eighth time in his career. Leury Garcia, who had sat out since Sunday when he injured his left hand on sliding into second base, replaced Avisail Garcia in center field.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: RHP Mike Wright was unavailable because of shoulder soreness he began experiencing in the second inning of his two-inning relief appearance Wednesday. "That was a little bit alarming, because that was with three days off," manager Buck Showalter said. ... OF Seth Smith did not play for a third straight game because of a strained back and could be headed for the DL if he does not feel better Friday.	White Sox: RHP Michael Ynoa was activated off the 10-day DL (strained right hip flexor). Ynoa said the recovery was quicker than he expected and he felt good after three bullpen sessions. To make room on the roster, RHP Juan Minaya was optioned to Triple-A Charlotte.	UP NEXT	Orioles: RHP Kevin Gausman (3-5, 6.49) is slated to face RHP Carlos Martinez (5-5, 2.95) when the Orioles his St. Louis in a homestand opener.	White Sox: LHP Jose Quintana (2-8, 5.30) starts Friday night at Toronto, which opens the series against RHP Joe Biagini (1-5, 3.38). An All-Star last season, Quintana is 0-4 with a 6.51 ERA in his last seven starts.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

PHILADELPHIA --  Nick Pivetta figured that if the Phillies were going to end their losing streak he needed to keep up with Boston ace Chris Sale.	Pivetta did just that with the best performance of his young career in a pitchers' duel with Sale. Pinch-hitter Ty Kelly doubled home the only run in the eighth inning to lead the Phillies to a 1-0 victory over the Red Sox on Thursday night.	"It was the first time I faced a guy like that," Pivetta said. "It was really exciting. I tried to go toe to toe with him and stay with him as much as I can."	Sale (8-3) was cruising until a one-out single by Andrew Knapp set the stage for Kelly's game-winning hit that ended the Phillies' eight-game losing streak. Kelly lined a slider into the left-field corner. Andrew Benintendi's throw sailed over the cutoff man and was a tad late, allowing Knapp to score from first for the only run of the game.	Kelly said the hit was in the top five moments of his big league career.	"It feels good," he said. "Maybe more of my friends will text me tonight."	Sale allowed four hits with 10 strikeouts, upping his major league-leading total to 136. It was his 44th career double-digit strikeout game and ninth this season.	"He was outstanding once again," Boston manager John Farrell said. "He's one of the best pitchers in baseball."	Said Sale, "It was fun, but I would have liked to have gotten the win."	Pat Neshek (2-1) pitched a scoreless inning in relief of Pivetta and Hector Neris earned his sixth save in seven tries with a scoreless ninth to help Philadelphia win its first interleague game of the season.	"That was nice to see," Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said.	The Phillies salvaged a game in the four-game home and home series with the Red Sox to improve to 1-8 in interleague games.	Pivetta went past the fifth inning for the first time in his seventh start. He allowed four hits in seven innings and nearly matched Sale with nine strikeouts against two walks.	"He just pounded the strike zone," Mackanin said. "He didn't get in trouble and start nitpicking."	The Red Sox threatened in the eighth against Neshek when Sale led off with a double, his first career extra-base hit that drew the large contingent of visiting Red Sox fans to their feet. Sale went to third on Mookie Betts' lineout to right field, but Neshek struck out Dustin Pedroia and got Xander Bogaerts to pop out in foul territory to first baseman Tommy Joseph to end the threat.	STREAK CONTINUED	Joseph singled in the fourth inning to extend his hitting streak to 11 games. Joseph is batting .364 with four doubles, a homer and seven RBI over the stretch.	STREAK STOPPED	Pedroia finished 0 for 4 with two strikeouts, ending his streak of five straight multi-hit games.	RARE FEAT	Sale became just the fifth Boston pitcher to record an extra-base hit, joining Josh Beckett, John Lackey, Derek Lowe and Jake Peavy.	NO EMERGENCY	The game continued in the fifth inning despite a fire alarm that rang loudly throughout the stadium and a message on the scoreboard that asked fans to leave the ballpark. The alarm stopped just before Sale struck out Daniel Nava for the first out.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: 1B Mitch Moreland returned after he was out of the lineup on Wednesday after getting hit by a pitch on the left foot in Tuesday's game against Philadelphia. ... RHP Tyler Thornburg will undergo season-ending surgery on Friday for thoracic outlet syndrome. Thornburg hasn't pitched all season after feeling discomfort in his throwing shoulder this spring. ... RHP Carson Smith will begin a rehab assignment on Sunday at Triple-A Pawtucket. Smith hasn't pitched this year after having Tommy John surgery last season.

DETROIT --  Miguel Cabrera came into Thursday night's game against Tampa Bay without a homer since May 20, though that didn't give the Rays much confidence.	"We all know what that man can do," Rays manager Kevin Cash said. "He can hit a homer at any time to any place in any ballpark."	Cabrera, who has been struggling with a sore back, did just that, going the opposite way for a two-run homer in the ninth inning to give the Detroit Tigers a 5-3 victory.	"The way it is going right now, I wasn't sure it was going to get out," he said. "I'm dealing with my back every day, but I still have to go out there and play hard."	The game was tied at three entering the ninth, but Alex Avila singled off Tommy Hunter (0-2) with one out. Andrew Romine pinch ran and trotted home when Cabrera hit his seventh career game-ending homer into the right-field stands.	"That was huge for us, and big for him to get off the slide," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said. "He's definitely a player who can raise his game under pressure."	Justin Wilson (3-2) picked up the win with a scoreless inning of relief.	Tigers starter Justin Verlander pitched seven innings, allowing two runs on six hits and five walks. He's now walked five batters three times this season after not doing it a single time in 2016. He struck out six.	"Seven innings and two runs is a good start," he said. "I could sense it was going to be a close game, so I wanted to keep us in it and give us a chance."	Alex Cobb gave up three runs on eight hits and two walks in 6 2/3 innings, striking out three.	Victor Martinez gave the Tigers a 1-0 lead with his first RBI of June, a single that snapped a 0-for-16 slump.	Daniel Robertson tied it in the second with a run-scoring groundout, and Logan Morrison put the Rays ahead with a two-out double in the third.	J.D. Martinez's double made it 2-2 in the bottom of the third, but Cobb and Verlander both settled down at that point.	Ian Kinsler led off the seventh with a single and took second on Avila's walk. However, Cobb got Cabrera to bounce into a 5-4-3 double play on his 116th and final pitch.	"Normally, you never want to let Miggy see a pitcher for a fourth time, but Alex was getting him to hit the ball on the ground to third," Cash said. "I decided to take the chance and it worked out."	Jumbo Diaz came out of the bullpen and got Victor Martinez to hit a routine grounder to short, but it went under Robertson's glove, allowing Avila to score the go-ahead run.	"During the pitching change, we had been talking about there being a lot of loose dirt on the infield," Robertson said. "I know Martinez can't run, but I didn't want to get caught between hops, so I came in to get it and my foot just slipped."	Francisco Rodriguez pitched the eighth for Detroit, and allowed a long tying homer to Steven Souza Jr.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: C Wilson Ramos (ACL) went 1 for 3 in a seven-inning catching stint while on rehab at Triple-A Durham. RHP Brad Boxberger (flexor strain) struck out the side in the seventh inning while making his first rehab outing.	Tigers: Victor Martinez left the game after reaching on Robertson's seventh-inning error due to an illness.	SETTING UP CABRERA	Cobb said his approach to Cabrera in the seventh inning was simple: fastballs on the inside corner.	"He was taking every outside pitch the other way, and he was crushing off-speed pitches, so I was going to get beat with my best shot," he said. "That's one of the toughest outs in baseball, but I got it."	K-ROD STRUGGLES AGAIN	Francisco Rodriguez complained to the media earlier this week about his usage since losing the closer's role. He said that he thinks he deserves another shot at late-inning situations and that he's not happy with the lack of communication from Ausmus and pitching coach Rich Dubee.	He got a chance Thursday to pitch in the eighth inning of a tie game, and gave up a 432-foot homer and a double that was measured as 99 mph off the bat.	UP NEXT	Rays: RHP Erasmo Ramirez (3-1, 4.20) will pitch for Tampa Bay in the second game of a four-game series. Ramirez is 1-1 with a 6.59 ERA in six career appearances, including two starts, against Detroit.	Tigers: LHP Daniel Norris is scheduled to start for Detroit on Friday. Norris (3-4, 4.41) is 2-6 with a 4.52 ERA in 14 career starts at Comerica Park.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

NEW YORK --  Bryce Harper hammered this home run so sweetly, it sailed over the head of Mets right fielder Jay Bruce -- twice, it really did.	"I think that's the hardest ball I've ever hit in my life," Harper said.	Harper and the Washington Nationals battered New York from the start, romping 8-3 and reversing a recent slide by the NL East leaders.	Harper lined a solo drive in the first inning that flew about a dozen rows deep into the seats. The ball ricocheted out of the stands in a hurry and Bruce tried but couldn't catch the rebound, the carom carrying far onto the grass.	"It wasn't a moonshot. That was like a Hank Aaron shot," marveled manager Dusty Baker, who played with the one-time home run king.	Harper's 17th home run left the bat at 116.3 mph, his hardest-hit ball since Statcast began tracking in 2015.	"That was a different sound," winning pitcher Gio Gonzalez praised. "When you hear a loud sound like that, you know it's going far."	Daniel Murphy added three more hits against his former team and Michael A. Taylor hit the Nationals' league-leading 100th home run to cap a five-run fifth.	Baker won on his 68th birthday. Also celebrating birthdays -- Harper's dad and Gonzalez's mom.	"First off, happy birthday to Dusty. Have to do your best not to lose on his day," Gonzalez said.	Washington had lost five of six going into this four-game series while the sub-.500 Mets had won five of six.	The banged-up Mets lost more than a game.	A day after pitcher Matt Harvey and second baseman Neil Walker left with injuries that will put both of them on the disabled list, center fielder Juan Lagares broke his left thumb trying to make a diving catch. Earlier in the game, the former Gold Glover threw out Harper at the plate.	The Mets have gotten hurt a lot this season, enough that manager Terry Collins said he wasn't surprised when a trainer told him Lagares had snapped the thumb on his glove hand.	"That's kind of my thought. How many can we possibly continue to have to play through?" he said. "But you know what the answer is? As many as pop up. That's how many you've got to play through."	Gonzalez (6-1) gave up two hits and five hits in seven innings, and improved to 10-1 at Citi Field. A career .102 hitter coming in, he helped himself with an RBI single.	Robert Gsellman (5-4) was tagged for seven runs and 11 hits in five innings. He had won three straight starts, but fell behind when Harper homered.	Wilmer Flores and Rene Rivera homered for the Mets.	DANIEL DOES IT AGAIN	Murphy tripled, singled twice and drove in two runs. He hit safely in all 19 games vs. the Mets last year after they let him go the previous winter, and is now 41-104 (.394) with seven doubles, a triple, eight home runs and 28 RBI in 26 career games against his former team.	Murphy, a postseason star in the Mets' run into the 2015 World Series, typically plays down the revenge angle, basically saying it's always good to beat a division rival. If there is any motivation, Baker doesn't mind.	"I hope he's fueled the rest of his career," Baker said.	SKIPPER STUFF	Collins is the oldest manager in the majors, but not by much -- he was born less than three weeks before Baker. ... The win made Baker 8-12 on his birthday as a manager.	PITCH `N CATCH	New York Giants tight end Evan Engram, the team's first-round draft pick, threw out the ceremonial first pitch. The former Mississippi star exchanged a quick hug with Gsellman and made a solid toss from the down slope of the mound.	COLLEGE BOUND	Baker said son Darren was still headed to play at the University of California, a day after the 18-year-old shortstop was drafted in the 27th round by the Nationals. "It's all good," dad said, "but he's going to school."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: LHP Matt Grace was recalled from Triple-A Syracuse for his fifth stint this season with Washington. RHP Trevor Gott was sent down, a day after he was hit hard while throwing 52 pitches vs. Atlanta.	Mets: Walker (hamstring) was put on the 10-day disabled list and Harvey (stress injury to shoulder) was set to go on the DL on Friday. ... OF Michael Conforto missed his fourth straight start with a stiff back, but came in after Lagares was hurt.	UP NEXT	Nationals: RHP Max Scherzer (7-4, 2.36 ERA) leads the NL with 124 strikeouts. He pitched the second of two no-hitters in 2015 at Citi Field, fanning 17 Mets.	Mets: LHP Steven Matz (1-0, 1.29) pitched seven strong innings last weekend at Atlanta to win his season debut after a bout with elbow inflammation.	---	More AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ST. LOUIS --  Milwaukee's Keon Broxton is quickly gaining a reputation at Busch Stadium. His tape measure home run Thursday night furthered that narrative.	Broxton and Eric Thames homered to lift the Milwaukee Brewers to a 6-4 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals.	Thames' 18th of the season off Cardinals closer Seung Hwan Oh (1-3) in the ninth barely skimmed over the right field wall and broke a 4-4 tie as the NL Central-leading Brewers won their second straight series against the Cardinals and improved to 36-32. Milwaukee had gone 0-15-2 in the previous 17 series.	Broxton drilled the first pitch he saw 489 feet into the left field seats to tie the game 2-2 in the second. It is the longest home run in Busch Stadium III's history and the second-longest this season in the major leagues.	"I was shocked. I'm blessed to be able to do that," Broxton said. "There's a lot of players that came through this ballpark and hit a lot of home runs here, so for mine to be the longest is definitely a blessing."	Broxton is hitting .450 (9 for 20) with three homers and seven RBI in six games this season at Busch Stadium.	"In BP he hit a ball the same distance, the same spot," Thames said. "It was halfway to center field. It was a blast. That homer was like the same exact spot. It was a shot. He's a strong guy, very lanky. When the ball hits his barrel, he's a strong cat."	Domingo Santana's single scored Eric Sogard to give the Brewers a 3-2 lead in the third.	For the second consecutive start, Brewers right-hander Zach Davies gave up four runs in five innings. He gave up nine hits and struck out one.	Oliver Drake earned his first career save for the Brewers. Josh Hader and Carlos Torres (3-4) combined for three scoreless innings of relief.	"Hats off to those guys in the bullpen tonight," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. "Josh, Carlos and Oliver handled big innings in tight situations the whole way, six through nine, they did a heck of a job."	Stephen Piscotty and Aledmys Diaz had RBI singles to give the Cardinals a 2-0 lead in the first.	Dexter Fowler tied it for the Cardinals with a solo home run in the third and again with a single scoring Matt Carpenter in the fifth.	Carpenter doubled in the first and fifth, scoring both times. He has doubled in six straight games.	Michael Wacha struggled again, giving up four runs in four innings. It is the fourth of his last five starts that the Cardinals right-hander failed to go five innings.	The Cardinals have lost three straight and fell to 30-35.	"We're not a team that should be below .500 and that's where we are and it's frustrating and I don't know how to say it in any other way," Carpenter said. "This is not something we're used to and it's not something we enjoy and it's not fun."	MISSED OPPORTUNITY	The Brewers had bases loaded with no outs in the fifth, but only scored once on a single by Travis Shaw. Thames was thrown out at home trying to score from second on Shaw's hit and Santana was thrown out at home on a safety squeeze.	"Only getting one run in that inning was frustrating for sure, but the bullpen gave us the momentum back it felt like by putting up zeros and giving the offense a chance," Counsell said.	PINBALL WIZARD	Yadier Molina was retired on a rare 3-4-1 play in the eighth. His grounder went off Thames' glove, but Sogard barehanded the deflection and threw to Torres to get Molina at first.	FACES IN THE CROWD	Actor and comedian George Lopez was on the field during batting practice interviewing players about their superstitions for a segment in his upcoming show.	TRAINING ROOM	Brewers: OF Ryan Braun (left calf strain) fielded balls in left field during batting practice, but there is no timetable for a return.	Cardinals: INF Paul DeJong was recalled from Triple-A Memphis and 2B Kolten Wong (right triceps strain) was placed on the 10-day DL.	UP NEXT	Brewers: RHP Junior Guerra (1-1, 2.45 ERA) will make his sixth start as the team returns home for a three-game set against San Diego and RHP Miguel Diaz (1-1, 6.92 ERA). He is 1-1 with a 3.60 ERA in two career starts against the Padres.	Cardinals: RHP Carlos Martinez (5-5, 2.95 ERA) will kick off a three-game series at Baltimore and RHP Kevin Gausman (3-5, 6.49 ERA). His 1.93 Interleague ERA is the fifth-lowest in MLB history (minimum eight starts).	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DENVER --  The Colorado Rockies got their first walkoff win of the season, thanks to a rookie.	Raimel Tapia hit a run-scoring single in the bottom of the ninth inning and the Rockies recovered from blowing a late lead to beat the San Francisco Giants 10-9 on Thursday night.	"This cat has confidence," Rockies manager Bud Black said of Tapia, who has multiple hits in each of his last three starts. "I thought over time the Triple-A numbers would translate. We've seen that the last couple days. He's been swinging well."	Nolan Arenado doubled three times and drove in four runs, while D.J. LeMahieu added four hits. The Rockies won for the 10th time in 14 games this month despite allowing the Giants to come back from an eight-run deficit.	"Scrappy win," Black added. "We needed that. We couldn't let that one get way."	Mark Reynolds began the tiebreaking rally by singling off Hunter Strickland (1-2) to start the ninth. After Ian Desmond popped out, pinch-hitter Carlos Gonzalez, the Rockies veteran slugger who has been in a slump, walked to bring up Tapia, who came through with his second hit of the night.	"I feel really good in those situations, when they're pitching around someone to get to you," Tapia said through a translator. "You know you have the opportunity to come up and make an impact."	Buster Posey connected for his ninth home run, a two-drive in the seventh off reliever Scott Oberg, but then left the game with ankle soreness. Eduardo Nunez also left the game with hamstring tightness after legging out a leadoff infield single in the seventh. The team said both players' status was day to day.	Nick Hundley, who replaced Posey at catcher, had a pinch-hit home run to ignite a five-run eighth. Pitcher Ty Blach, in a rare pinch-hitting appearance, also had an RBI single. Brandon Crawford then drove a 2-2 offering from Jake McGee into the left-field bleachers for a three-run homer that pulled the Giants, who trailed 9-1 earlier, within a run.	Austin Slater singled off closer Greg Holland to lead off the ninth for his fourth hit of the game. Holland fanned Hundley but Denard Span singled and Gorkys Hernandez delivered a game-tying sacrifice fly, marking the first blown save of the season for Holland (1-0). He had converted a franchise-record 23 in a row to start the year.	With Giants position players depleted, Jeff Samardzija became the second Giants pitcher to be used as a pinch-hitter. While he was up, Span, who had stolen third, broke for the plate when a pitch trickled out of the glove of catcher Tom Murphy. Murphy quickly grabbed it and flipped the ball to Holland covering home, and the sliding Span was tagged out in a bang-bang play that survived replay review.	Span said afterward that he did not immediately get a clear view of ball coming out of the catcher's glove and rolling backward past the umpire.	"I hesitated a split-second and I think that was the difference between me being safe and out," he said.	Giants starter Matt Moore went three innings and allowed eight runs on 11 hits.	The Rockies did most of their damage early, scoring seven runs in the first two innings. Arenado had an RBI double in the first and a two-run double in the second. He had another run-scoring double in the sixth.	FLYING CATCH	A stunning defensive play by Rockies shortstop Trevor Story helped keep the Giants in check early in the game. With the bases loaded and two outs in the second inning, Span hit a liner that seemed headed for left field. Story ranged to his right in a dead run and then made a sideways leap to snag the liner in midair, keeping the ball snugly in his glove despite hitting the ground with a thud. "I was just like, `You've got to be kidding me," Span said. "That's just the type of season that's been going on for us."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Giants: LHP Madison Bumgarner (left shoulder sprain) is scheduled to pitch a simulated game Sunday morning before the team's series finale against the Rockies. A minor league rehab assignment will follow if all goes well.	Rockies: C Ryan Hanigan was optioned to Triple-A Albuquerque to make roster room for C Tom Murphy, who was reintstated from the 10-day disabled list after recovering from a broken right forearm sustained March 11 during a spring training game. ... RHP Jon Gray (stress fracture, left foot) is slated to make his second rehab start Monday for Albuquerque and throw 75-80 pitches. ...LHP Tyler Anderson (left knee inflammation) is scheduled to make a rehab start Sunday for Albuquerque and throw about 75 pitches.	UP NEXT	Giants: Samardzija (2-8, 4.31 ERA) has gone 0-2 with an 8.03 ERA in two previous starts against Colorado this season.	Rockies: Rookie RHP Antonio Senzatela (8-2, 3.84) has won six of his seven decisions this season at Coors Field.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  Pitching coach Curt Young got fired earlier in the day. Oakland veteran Trevor Plouffe was designated for assignment to make way for prized prospect Matt Chapman.	On a night that could have been filled with distractions and disappointment over the major changes , the Athletics played for 4 1/2 hours to finally beat the New York Yankees.	Khris Davis blooped a two-run single in the 10th inning that glanced off second baseman Starlin Castro's glove in shallow center and the A's topped the Yankees in a seesaw 8-7 win Thursday night.	"There were definitely a lot of things going on around here," A's starter Sonny Gray said. "At the same time, when it gets to 7 o'clock, we have to focus on the task at hand."	It was Davis' third career game-ending hit and came after Castro had put New York ahead in the top half on a sacrifice fly.	Davis' game-winner came off Giovanny Gallegos (0-1) to finally close out the 4-hour, 29-minute game. Rajai Davis singled with two outs and Chad Pinder's double put runners on second and third.	Liam Hendriks (3-1) pitched the top of the 10th for the win on a night New York stranded 13 baserunners and Oakland 12.	The A's had failed to hold their leads all game, then came through to snap a three-game skid with just their second victory in the last eight.	Aaron Judge walked against Hendriks in the top half to load the bases for Castro, whose fly allowed Brett Gardner to slide home headfirst and beat the throw.	"We kept fighting back. We got behind then we tied it up, got behind, tied it up," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "We did it a bunch of times. It hurts because it's a matter of a couple inches that you lose that game by and it's frustrating."	New Oakland third baseman Chapman struck out with the bases loaded in the ninth, going hitless in his major league debut.	Chris Carter homered in the eighth for the Yankees off John Axford to tie it.	Matt Joyce slid headfirst into first base to avoid an inning-ending double play as Yonder Alonso scored the go-ahead run in the eighth inning, but the Yankees tied it again in the ninth on Gary Sanchez's RBI single as Santiago Casilla blew his third save of the season.	Alonso and Jed Lowrie each homered for the A's.	Gray's winless stretch reached four starts with his third straight no-decision since he beat the Marlins on May 24.	Top prospect Chapman, a first-round draft pick in 2014, went 0 for 3 with two walks and two strikeouts after being called up from Triple-A Nashville.	Judge, the Yankees' rookie sensation, returned to his native Northern California and lined the first pitch he saw from Gray for a single to right-center.  He struck out in the third, sixth and ninth innings and grounded out in the seventh.	DRAFT REPORT	New York used its first draft pick, the 16th overall, to select South Carolina right-hander Clarke Schmidt, who had Tommy John surgery on May 3. Damon Oppenheimer, the Yankees' vice president of domestic amateur scouting, compared Schmidt with James Kaprielian, taken by New York with the 16th pick two years ago. Kaprielian had Tommy John surgery in April. "With Schmidt we're getting the kind of stuff we think that we saw from Kaprielian and we think we have the makeup and everything to get to where he comes back to the kind of pitcher we saw as a healthy guy," Oppenheimer said during a conference call. The Yankees used their 22nd-round pick on Seattle University right-hander Jason Junk. "He's got a unique name, and it probably doesn't go along real well with the kind of stuff he has because he's a 91-to-96 mile-an-hour guy," Oppenheimer said. "So he just decided to go a different route than the type of name he has."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: Sanchez felt tightness in his abductor muscle and is day to day, Girardi said. ... LHP CC Sabathia went on the 10-day disabled list after being diagnosed with a left hamstring strain that could sideline him for at least four weeks. The pitcher sustained the Grade 2 strain when pushing off the rubber Tuesday in Anaheim. New York recalled RHP Domingo German from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to take Sabathia's roster spot and also brought up right-hander Luis Cessa from Triple-A. ... 1B Greg Bird suffered a setback in his rehab from a bone bruise in his right ankle. Girardi said Bird will be examined by team physician Dr. Christopher Ahmad on Friday.	Athletics: SS Marcus Semien, likely to return in early July from right wrist surgery on April 18, is scheduled to take batting practice on the field Friday and also field groundballs. "That'll be a big step for him tomorrow," manager Bob Melvin said. ... RHP Andrew Triggs is waiting on a second opinion on his strained left hip.	UP NEXT	Yankees: RHP Luis Severino (5-2, 2.75 ERA) pitches the second game after an extra day of rest looking to keep an impressive stretch going. He is 3-0 with a 1.90 ERA over his last seven starts, allowing only five earned runs over 33 1/3 innings during his past five outings.	Athletics: LHP Sean Manaea (6-3, 3.67) is 5-0 with a 1.97 ERA over his last five starts, the longest winning streak of his career.	---	AP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum in New York contributed to this story.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  A trip to California was all the Kansas City Royals needed to get their offense in gear.	Lorenzo Cain and Alex Gordon hit solo home runs and the Royals picked up their fifth consecutive victory, beating the Los Angeles Angels 7-2 on Thursday night.	The Royals have now scored at least seven runs in each of their last five games, marking only the third such streak in franchise history. The feat was previously accomplished May 25-June 1, 1978 and Aug. 9-12 1979.	The streaking Royals have been getting it done with power, clubbing 14 homers in this unbeaten stretch that began at San Diego, continued in San Francisco and has carried back down to Orange County.	"The offense is just rolling right now," Gordon said. "It started in San Diego. As an offense, it kind of clicks, and everyone just, you know, tags along."	Cain hit a line drive that barely cleared the wall in left center in the third inning, and Gordon followed it up with a shot to center in the fourth, his third of the year.	For Gordon, who went 3 for 5 and came up a triple shy of hitting for the cycle, it was especially gratifying. He arrived in California hitting .174, but is 8 for 22 on the trip.	"You try to keep your head up," Gordon said. "Obviously, you are going to go through struggles in baseball sometimes, and just try to find a way out of it. Hopefully it will keep coming."	That was more than enough support for Matt Strahm (2-3), who won his first career start after making 41 appearances as a reliever over the past two seasons. Strahm went five innings, striking out three while giving up three hits and one walk.	"It's the first time we've seen him in the windup this year, but he commanded his pitches well," Royals manager Ned Yost said.	Ricky Nolasco (2-8) dropped his sixth straight start, giving up five runs and 10 hits in six innings, while the Angels failed to pick up their first three-game winning streak since Mike Trout's thumb injury.	Kole Calhoun put the Angels ahead 1-0 in the first, scoring an unearned run when Albert Pujols singled to right after initially reaching second on Gordon's error, but the Royals responded with two runs in the second after a throwing error by Calhoun.	Danny Espinosa of the Angels lost a home run in the fifth when the video replay showed his shot into the corner in left had curled out of play.	The Angels did finally notch their second run an inning later when Yunel Escobar picked up an RBI, only for the Royals to respond with three in the seventh. Mike Moustakas had two RBI, giving him 16 in 13 games this month.	Moustakas' eruption is indicative of a team-wide trend. The Royals have scored 42 runs in their last five games.	EASY ADJUSTMENT	Considering Strahm's last start happened in Double-A last July, the second-year left-hander had no apparent issues transitioning from reliever to the first pitcher up.	"I don't ever feel like I conserve anything," Strahm said. "Competing every pitch and just try to be as effective as possible with every pitch."	The plan was to have Strahm throw between 65 and 70 pitches, and he finished at 68. Pitching coach Dave Eiland wanted to have Strahm get up to throw four times, but Yost felt confident in letting him get back up for the fifth.	"Now, hopefully 85 pitches next time," Strahm said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals: DH Brandon Moss was back in the starting lineup after being limited to three at-bats as a pinch-hitter during interleague play at San Diego and San Francisco. Moss went 1 for 5.	Angels: RHP Matt Shoemaker's status for his next scheduled start is uncertain after leaving Wednesday's game against the Yankees with tightness in his forearm. "Historically, he has had these before and they seem like they go away in fairly short order," manager Mike Scioscia said. "How many days that is remains to be seen." . Scioscia believes RHP Cam Bedrosian (groin) is "very close" to returning. Bedrosian pitched 2/3 of an inning in a rehab assignment with the Angels' Single-A affiliate Thursday.	SIGNED, SEALED, STARTING SOON	The Angels have signed first-round draft pick Jordon Adell and the No. 10 overall selection will report to the club's rookie ball affiliate in Arizona next Wednesday.	"For me, it was a no-brainer," Adell said. "This organization believed in me and it was easy. I didn't want to waste any time. I wanted to get right to work."	Adell led the nation with 25 home runs last season for Ballard High School in Louisville, Kentucky.	UP NEXT	Royals: RHP Ian Kennedy (0-6) has given up at least four runs in each of his last six starts. The Huntington Beach native and former USC star is unlikely to find any home-cooking against the Angels, with an 0-4 record in six career starts.	Angels: RHP Jesse Chavez (5-6) has allowed a home run in 11 straight appearances to set a franchise record. Chavez dropped his only previous start against the Royals in 2015.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK --  Max Scherzer's ninth pitch to Yoenis Cespedes went high and pushed the count full. Matt Wieters signaled for another fastball, and the reigning NL Cy Young Award winner shook him off.	Cespedes fouled off a slider, and Scherzer came back with another offspeed offering, his 118th pitch of the night. Cespedes swung over it for the 10th strikeout of Scherzer's masterful performance , and the Washington's ace pounded his glove with a fist. The 32-year-old right-hander reached double digits in strikeouts for the fifth straight start and limited the Mets to four hits, leading the Nationals over New York 7-2 on Friday night.	"I love it. I love competing against the best," Scherzer said. "I knew that's my last batter. I knew that I was at the end of the rope. And that's just everything he is, everything I've got, and let's compete."	Wieters had wanted to stay with fastballs up and outside.	"If he knows he's going to throw that good of a slider, he should definitely shake me off and throw that good of a slider," Wieters said.	Wieters and Michael A. Taylor hit consecutive homers starting the third inning against Steven Matz (1-1), and Anthony Rendon added a two-run homer in the sixth and had three RBI. Bryce Harper finished with three hits, including a run-scoring single , as the Nationals improved to 5-0 at Citi Field this year.	Scherzer (8-4) won for the fourth time in five starts, starting 26 of 29 batters with strikes. He never threw more than 16 pitches in an inning until the eighth.	He walked two and hit two batters with changeups, and his 118 pitches were his most since May 11 last year. He got defensive help when Washington's infield turned three double plays behind him.	"I'm a fly-ball pitcher, guys," he said. "That never happens."	Nationals manager Dusty Baker didn't mind.	"Sometimes the stats are wrong," he said.	Scherzer allowed four hits or fewer for the 10th time in 14 starts and reached double digits in strikeouts for the eighth time this season and the 57th time in his big league career. The five straight double-digit games set his career high.	"It's a cool accomplishment. That's not easy to do," he said. "You've got to be on your game every single game, and your pitches have to be sharp every single time out."	Jose Reyes led off the eighth with his first home run since May 1, driving a hanging curveball into the right-field second deck, and Jay Bruce greeted Shawn Kelley in the ninth with his 18th homer. New York, which dropped into third place, 10 1/2 games behind the NL East-leading Nationals, started a stretch in which it faces Stephen Strasburg on Saturday and the Los Angeles Dodgers' Clayton Kershaw on Monday.	"You cannot let him get the lead," Mets manager Terry Collins said of Scherzer. "You watch his demeanor on the mound. When he starts walking around with that big, long pace that he's got, he's locked in."	Making his second start since recovering from left elbow inflammation, Matz allowed four runs and eight hits in seven innings with four strikeouts and no walks. In his opening start of the season, he won at Atlanta last weekend.	Matz retired his first six batters -- matching the most by a Mets starter this year -- before Wieters homered into the center-field seats.Taylor drove an opposite-field drive over the right-field wall three pitches later , the sixth back-to-back homers for the Nationals this year.	Rendon made it 4-0 in the sixth with another opposite-field drivh	"I just have to have some better misses," Matz said. "When you're facing a guy like Scherzer, one of the best pitchers in the game right now, those mistakes are going to hurt you."	OLD FRIEND	Daniel Murphy doubled in the sixth and has reached in all 27 games he's played against the Mets, hitting .393 (42 for 107) with eight doubles, a triple, eight homers and 28 RBI.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: LHP Sammy Solis, on the DL since April 19 with inflammation in his pitching elbow, began a rehab assignment at Triple-A Syracuse on Thursday and pitched one inning against visiting Pawtucket, allowing a home run to Rusney Castillo leading off the first. Solis then got three groundouts around a walk.	Mets: RHP Matt Harvey (stress injury to the scapula bone in his pitching shoulder) and OF Juan Lagares (broken left thumb) were put on the 10-day DL. New York recalled INF Matt Reynolds and OF Brandon Nimmo from Triple-A Las Vegas.	UP NEXT	Nationals: Strasburg (7-2) has allowed more than three earned runs in just two of 13 starts.	Mets: RHP Seth Lugo (1-0) makes his second start of the season after recovering from inflammation in his pitching elbow. He allowed one run and six hits over seven innings at Atlanta last Sunday.	---	More AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

BALTIMORE --  The St. Louis Cardinals enjoyed a feel-good blowout at the expense of the Baltimore Orioles, who absorbed another lopsided defeat in a duel between struggling teams in different leagues.	Carlos Martinez struck out eight over six sharp innings, and St. Louis hit a season-high five home runs in an 11-2 victory Friday night.	The Cardinals arrived at Camden Yards having lost 10 of their previous 14 games, but their breakdown was certainly no worse than that of the Orioles, who were 25-16 on May 20 and now stand at 32-34.	For one night, anyway, St. Louis (31-35) looked every bit like a team that's reached the postseason in five of the past six years. The Cards ended a three-game skid.	"It was kind of like passing the baton. I think that's what we did all night," rookie Paul DeJong said. "Everyone stepped up at the plate. It was just a fun time to be playing for the Cardinals."	DeJong became the third player in Cardinals history to have at least three hits, three runs, three RBI and a home run while batting ninth. Hall of Fame pitchers Bob Gibson and Dizzy Dean were the others.	Matt Carpenter and Dexter Fowler connected in succession to cap a four-run sixth inning, Tommy Pham hit a two-run drive in the seventh and Jedd Gyorko added a solo shot in the ninth to help St. Louis snap an eight-game road losing streak.	"Hopefully we continue with this and keep winning ballgames," Carpenter said. "Anytime you have a day like today, it's a good start for sure."	Coming off a four-hit shutout against Philadelphia, Martinez (6-5) gave up one run and four hits. The right-hander has 45 strikeouts over his last five starts.	"He's just in a nice place right now, making good pitches," Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said.	Trey Mancini hit his 11th home run for Baltimore, an anticlimactic drive with two outs in the ninth.	After losing seven of eight on a three-city road trip, the Orioles launched a seven-game homestand with a mighty thud.	"When we're going well, everybody is doing well. When we're not, it's the whole team," outfielder Hyun Soo Kim said through a translator.	Kevin Gausman (3-6) allowed five runs and nine hits over 5 2/3 innings. He was replaced by Gabriel Ynoa, who yielded three home runs.	"It's going to turn around at some point," Gausman said. "I wanted to be the one to kind of right the ship today, but it just didn't work out that way."	After a sacrifice fly by Manny Machado got Baltimore to 2-1 in the third, DeJong hit a two-run drive in the fourth.	An RBI single by DeJong, a two-run drive by Carpenter and Fowler's home run made it 8-1 in the sixth.	Carpenter went 2 for 3 and is 17 for 38 (.447) since he moved into the leadoff spot on June 7.	ROSTER MOVES	The Orioles placed RHP Mike Wright (right shoulder bursitis) on the 10-day disabled list, optioned RHP Jimmy Yacabonis to Triple-A Norfolk and recalled relievers Vidal Nu�o and Ynoa.	NUMBER CHANGE	Cardinals reliever Brett Cecil switched from No. 21 to 27, the number he wore with Toronto. The number became open after Jhonny Peralta was released Tuesday.	JIMENEZ TO START	Dropped from the rotation last month, Orioles right-hander Ubaldo Jimenez gets another chance to start on Sunday. "Ubaldo has responded well to some time in the bullpen. We'll see if that happens again," manager Buck Showalter said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: The Cardinals wonder if RHP Michael Wacha's poor start against Milwaukee on Thursday (four innings, four runs) could be attributed to an injury. "First thing we always do is go to health," Matheny said. "We'll get hands on and get him evaluated."	Orioles: Closer Zach Britton (left forearm strain) will launch his rehabilitation assignment by pitching for Class A Aberdeen on Monday. ... RHP Darren O'Day (right shoulder strain) threw on Thursday. "No pain, no problems," Showalter said.	UP NEXT	Cardinals: Adam Wainwright (7-4, 4.73 ERA) makes his first career start against the Orioles on Saturday, the only major league team he hasn't faced.	Orioles: Wade Miley (2-4, 3.97 ERA) makes his 14th start of the season and fifth of his career against the Cardinals, a team he last faced in 2014.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

PHILADELPHIA --  Gregor Blanco wants everyone to take notice when he hits a rare home run.	Blanco hit a tying two-run homer in the seventh and Jake Lamb drove in the go-ahead run with a sacrifice fly later in the inning to rally the Arizona Diamondbacks to a 5-4 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Friday night.	According to MLB StatCast, Blanco's 23rd career homer -- and second this season -- against Aaron Nola (3-5) had an estimated distance of 424 feet into the concourse in right field.	"I hit one like that in Miami a couple years ago off Jose Fernandez that went into the upper deck," Blanco said.  "I don't hit many, but when I hit a homer, I hit it far."	Pinch-hitter Jeremy Hazelbaker starter off the seventh with an infield single, and Blanco followed with hhis tying shot on a 2-2 pitch.	"It wasn't an easy at bat," Blanco said. "Nola was doing a good job mixing up his pitches. In that situation I was just trying to put a good swing on the ball. He left it a little up and I was able to hit it out."	David Peralta tripled among his three hits, including a single that followed Blanco's homer. Peralta advanced to third on Paul Goldschmidt's single off Pat Neshek and scored on Lamb's fly ball to center field.	"We do well responding to a lot of negative moments and I think that's what good teams do," Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said. "They learn how to win and stay together. The big blow was Gregor's home run to tie it, but inside of the game after that we had a lot of (good) little moments."	Patrick Corbin (6-6) gave up four runs -- two earned -- and five hits while striking out five in six innings to get the win. Fernando Rodney got the last three outs for his 19th save.	The Diamondbacks have won five straight and eight of their last nine to improve to match their franchise-best mark through the first 68 games at 42-26.	Odubel Herrera had two hits and scored twice for the Phillies, and Maikel Franco drove in two runs.	The Phillies had a chance to tie it again in the bottom of the seventh when reliever Andrew Chafin put two runners on with two walks sandwiched around a sacrifice. He then struck out Herrera and Archie Bradley fanned Howie Kendrick.	"I was supposed to be ready for Kendrick and I was able to come in and retire him," said Bradley, who has thrived as a setup man after struggling as a starter in Arizona. "I've really embraced what I'm doing. We all do. We're all doing it for the sake of the team. This is fun. It's fun to win and we want to keep it rolling."	Nola gave was charged with all five runs and nine hits -- eight singles -- in six-plus innings. He walked two and struck out six.	"Nola pitched pretty well," Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said. "After six innings, two runs, he pitched pretty well. Then in the seventh he just hung a curveball to Blanco, which is a mistake, and he got burned."	Arizona scored twice in the fourth to take a 2-0 lead. With runners on first and second, Phillies third baseman Franco bobbled an easy double-play ball and was only able to secure one out with the runners advancing. Daniel Descalso followed with a run-scoring grounder and Jeff Mathis had an RBI single.	Kendrick had an RBI grounder in the bottom of the inning to pull the Phillies within one, and Cameron Rupp hpomerd to tie the score in the fifth with his fifth of the season.	Franco gave Philadelphia with a two-run double in the sixth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: OF A.J. Pollock will begin a rehab assignment Saturday at Triple A Reno. Pollock ran the bases without any issue Friday. He has been sidelined with a groin injury since being placed on the disabled list on May 15. If all goes well for Pollock he should be back with the team when Arizona returns home next weekend.	HERO'S WELCOME	Ty Kelly drove in the lone run of the Phillies 1-0 win over Boston on Thursday with a pinch hit double off Red Sox ace Chris Sale. When he showed up for work on Friday he learned he was in the starting lineup for just the fourth time this year and 14th time in his two-year career with the Mets and Phillies.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: RHP Zack Godley (2-1, 2.44) has been a pleasant surprise for the Diamondbacks and has had six consecutive quality starts since becoming a regular part of the starting rotation in early May.	Phillies: RHP Jerad Eickhoff (0-7, 5.09) is still searching for his first win in what will be his 14th start of the season, but he hasn't gotten much help from his teammates. The Phillies have scored fewer than two runs in five of his 13 starts and his 2.96 run support per game is the lowest in the National League.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PITTSBURGH --  Anthony Rizzo just missed a chance at making history at the start of the game but was happy with the ending.	Rizzo almost led off his third straight game with a homer, losing his bid after a replay review, before helping key a six-run rally in the ninth inning that sent the Chicago Cubs over the Pittsburgh Pirates 9-5 on Friday night.	The Cubs won for just the third time in nine games, putting the World Series champions back at .500 with a 33-33 mark.	Manager Joe Maddon wasn't around to see the comeback -- he was ejected in the first inning after Rizzo's drive into the Allegheny River was initially called fair, then ruled foul. In Rizzo's first two tries as a leadoff man in his seven-year career, the slugging first baseman who usually bats cleanup led off both games this week with home runs against the New York Mets at Citi Field.	The record for most consecutive games with a leadoff home run is three by Brady Anderson in 1996 for the Baltimore Orioles.	"That was absolutely a home run," Rizzo said. "There is no way it could have gone over the pole foul because this is one of the shortest right fields in the league. I hit it too hard for it to have time to go foul.	"I respect the umpires and I never like to criticize them because I know they give their very best but they got that one wrong. At least, we won the game and that's all that really matters."	Chicago trailed 4-3 until Jason Heyward and Willson Contreras began the ninth with doubles off Juan Nicasio (1-3) to tie it. Tony Watson, who was removed as the closer last week in favor of a Nicasco-Felipe Rivero combo, gave up a go-ahead single to pinch-hitter Jon Jay.	"They just came in aggressively and made their hits and their swings," said Nicasio, who was charged with four runs without recording an out. "No excuses. I threw my pitches where I wanted them. They did their part."	Rizzo added a two-run single, extending his hitting streak to 10 games, and Addison Russell had a two-run double.	"It seemed like everybody contributed in that inning," Russell said. "That's the type of offense I know we can be when everyone is clicking."	Closer Wade Davis gave up a run in the ninth, but struck out Josh Harrison and Gregory Polanco with the bases loaded to end it.	Koji Uehera (2-3) pitched a scoreless inning.	Tommy La Stella and Ian Happ, who grew up in Pittsburgh and was playing his first game at PNC Park, had two hits each for the Cubs. La Stella had a single in the ninth.	Josh Bell hit his 12th homer and a two-run triple to help the Pirates rally from 3-0 deficit. Andrew McCutchen also had two hits, including a single in the sixth that scored Bell and put Pittsburgh ahead 4-3.	Cubs starter Eddie Butler allowed four runs in 5 2/3 innings. The Pirates' Trevor Williams went five innings and gave up three runs.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: INF/OF Ben Zobrist (inflamed right wrist) was placed on the 10-day DL, retroactive to June 13, and is expected to be activated when first eligible June 24. La Stella was recalled from Triple-A Iowa. ... RHP Kyle Hendricks (right hand tendinitis) had a second MRI that revealed no new injuries but there is no timetable for his return.	PIRATES SIGN TOP PICK	RHP Shane Baz, the Pirates' first-round selection in this week's amateur draft, signed and will make his professional debut later this month in the rookie-level Gulf Coast League. Baz, who turns 18 on Saturday, starred at Concordia Lutheran High School in Tomball, Texas.	UP NEXT	Cubs RHP Jake Arrieta (6-4, 4.68 ERA) starts Saturday night against RHP Ivan Nova (6-4, 2.83). Arrieta allowed four runs in 4 1/3 innings in his last start, a no-decision against Colorado, but is 9-3 against Pittsburgh in his career. Nova has pitched at least six innings in all 13 starts this season.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

TORONTO --  Pitching at Rogers Centre again was all Jose Quintana needed to end his long winless stretch. Getting a lot of run support helped, too.	The left-hander pitched seven strong innings to pick up his first win since May 2 as the Chicago White Sox beat the Toronto Blue Jays 11-4 Friday night.	Quintana (3-8) improved to 5-0 in five career starts in Toronto after coming in 0-4 over his previous seven outings.	Despite coming into the game with a career-low run support of 2.65 per game this season, the lowest such mark in the majors, he got plenty against the Blue Jays as the White Sox scored seven runs in the first two innings.	"Every time is good when you get a lot of (run) support," he said. "Wow, it was a lot of runs though."	Melky Cabrera accounted for the majority of those in his return to Toronto, where he played from 2013-14. The left fielder hit his seventh home run and knocked in five runs to lead the White Sox to their fifth straight win at Rogers Centre, and their eighth victory in their last nine games against the Blue Jays.	With first-hand knowledge of just how potent the Blue Jays' lineup can sometimes be, Cabrera said that his team was not about to let up.	"We felt good but we kept going," he said through a translator. "We score as many runs as we can, especially for Jose and we were happy about it."	Toronto starter Joe Biagini (1-6) lasted just 33 pitches, getting yanked with none out in the second inning. The right-hander gave up eight hits and seven runs in the shortest start of his career.	"I kind of felt like I was kind of not staying within my mechanics very well," he said.	Manager John Gibbons was somewhat surprised by Biagini's struggles as he failed to record a strikeout. The 14 hits recorded by Chicago marked the third time this month Toronto has given up as many.	"He just had trouble throwing strikes," Gibbons said. "I've never seen that out of him before. He was on six days' rest with all the off-days, but no excuses."	All of the Blue Jays' scoring came on home runsl, with Kendrys Morales and Steve Pearce hitting solo shots early on and Justin Smoak adding a two-run shot in the ninth inning. It was Pearce's 19th home run of the season to leave him one shy of matching his career high.	According to STATS, the game marked the 11th time that the Blue Jays have hit three or more home runs and lost by seven or more runs.	WELCOME BACK?	According to StatsCentre, Cabrera is the first former Blue Jays player to have five or more RBI against his old team since Jayson Werth had eight on May 16, 2008.	DOUBLE DOWNER	The Blue Jays hit into four double plays for just the second time ever in a game against the White Sox. The first time took place on May 21, 1985.	GETTING OVER THE HUMP	At 32-33 coming into the game, Toronto had another chance to get back to .500 for the first time since opening day. For the seventh time though, the Blue Jays spurned the opportunity.	INSPIRED SUBSTITION	Two nights after hitting his first career home run, Alen Hanson was called to start in place of Leury Garcia in center field and bat leadoff. He took advantage of the opportunity with his first three-hit game, going 3 of 4 with a stolen base, three runs and one run batted in.	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox: OF Leury Garcia was pulled from the starting lineup with a left hand complaint, and replaced in the starting lineup by utility player Alen Hanson. Manager Rick Renteria expected Garcia to be available off the bench, and the team will see how the hand is on Saturday.	Blue Jays: OF Pearce returned from the 10-day DL following his calf strain and was inserted straight into the starting lineup. . In a corresponding move, utilityman Chris Coghlan was placed on the DL with a left wrist contusion.	UP NEXT	White Sox: RHP Mike Pelfrey (2-5, 3.88) is 2-1 with a 2.08 ERA and 22 strikeouts over his last five starts.	Blue Jays: RHP Marcus Stroman (7-2, 3.09) aims for his first career win against the White Sox in his fifth start against them	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

DETROIT --  For a team struggling to get above .500, the Detroit Tigers looked like a pennant contender on Friday night.	The Tigers got 13 hits, including seven for extra bases, and made several key defensive plays in a 13-4 win over the Tampa Bay Rays.	"That might be the best game we've played all year," Ian Kinsler said.	Nicholas Castellanos drove in four runs and Justin Upton drove in three, while Kinsler and Alex Avila homered.	Daniel Norris (4-4) got the win, giving up three runs on eight hits and a walk in six-plus innings.	"I think one walk was the key there," he said. "When I'm putting the ball in the strike zone, I can attack on a consistent basis."	Erasmo Ramirez (3-2) matched a career worst by allowing 10 runs on nine hits and two walks in 4 2/3 innings.	"That's a great lineup and I was missing pitches," he said. "That's always dangerous."	Kinsler hit the 43rd lead-off homer off his career in the first. That broke a tie with Curtis Granderson for sixth on the career list and moved him one behind Brady Anderson.	"The only thing that proves is I've led off a lot of games," he said.	Tampa Bay tied the game in the third. Peter Bourjos tripled with one out and Steven Souza Jr. followed with a grounder to third. Castellanos threw wildly to the plate, allowing Souza to take second,	The Rays took a 2-1 lead in the fourth on Daniel Robertson's RBI single.	The Tigers took over the game at that point, scoring five runs in each of the next two innings to take an 11-2 lead.	Avila led off the bottom of the fourth with his 10th homer. After a walk to Miguel Cabrera, J.D. Martinez singled and Upton lined an RBI double over the head of Smith in centerfield. Castellanos doubled down the left-field line to give the Tigers a three-run lead.	Alex Presley's infield single gave the Tigers six straight baserunners to start the inning, but James McCann ended the streak with a sacrifice fly to make it 6-2.	Jose Iglesias received a standing ovation after two spectacular defensive plays in the fifth. He charged a slow roller and threw out Bourjos, then sprinted straight back into left-centerfield to make an over-the-shoulder catch on Souza's pop up. The cheers continued when Upton reached over the left-field fence to rob the next hitter, Corey Dickerson, of a home run.	"I told Iggy that as sick as the play on Souza was, the play on Bourjos might have been better, given the way that guy runs," Norris said. "Then J-Up pulls back a homer. That's a good feeling as a pitcher."	The Tigers kept hitting in the fifth, with Upton's two-run single putting them up 8-2. Tim Beckham's throwing error later in the inning allowed two more runs to score.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: Despite his ugly pitching line, Ramirez didn't leave the game until his hamstring cramped after a grounder back to the mound. After making the play, he was examined by the training staff and replaced by Austin Pruitt.	Tigers: DH Victor Martinez was placed on the 10-day disabled list with an irregular heartbeat. The problem caused him to leave Thursday's game in the seventh inning, and he was still in the hospital on Friday night. The team is expecting to have further updates on Saturday.	THE IGLESIAS SHOW	Ausmus broke into the majors as a player in 1993, but said that he's never seen a shortstop with the same range as Iglesias on balls flared over his head. StatCast said that he ran 88 feet to make the over-the-shoulder catch against Souza in the fifth.	"That's a tougher play than anyone realizes, because he's got to get the right spot and make a tough catch with two outfielders running full speed at him," he said. "He just has a knack of getting to the ball and avoiding everything else."	UP NEXT	Rays: RHP Chris Archer (4-4, 3.80) will try to get the Rays a win in the third game of the four-game weekend series on Saturday. Archer had a no-decision against the Tigers on April 19, striking out nine in five innings but allowing four runs.	Tigers: RHP Michael Fulmer (6-4, 3.40) will attempt to continue his dominance of the Rays on Saturday. He's 2-1 with a 1.80 ERA and 26 strikeouts in 20 innings in three starts against Tampa Bay, although the loss and three of four earned runs came in Tampa Bay on April 18.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CINCINNATI --  Everything is working for Alex Wood these days, leaving him among the Dodgers' greats for the best start to a season.	The left-hander remained unbeaten by pitching four-hit ball over eight innings on Friday night, leading Los Angeles to a 3-1 victory that extended its domination of the Cincinnati Reds.	Wood (7-0) lost his shutout when Devin Mesoraco homered in the eighth. He's the first Dodgers pitcher to get so deep into a season without a loss since 1985, when Orel Hershiser made his first 11 starts without a loss, according to STATS.	"Very rarely does a pitcher have the command he's had of three pitches over this period of time," manager Dave Roberts said. "As a hitter, you know when a pitcher is on the attack and it's a helpless feeling."	Wood didn't walk a batter and struck out five, using his assortment of fastball, changeup and breaking ball to get ahead of hitters and finish them off.	"That's always the way I've pitched," Wood said. "I like to try to attack. But all three pitches have been as sharp together as they've ever been."	Kenley Jansen gave up a double in the ninth while picking up his 14th save.	The Dodgers have won six in a row over the Reds, who got swept in LA last weekend. The Dodgers are 15-3 against Cincinnati since 2015, one of the most dominant streaks in the NL over that time.	Cincinnati has dropped seven straight overall, matching its deepest slump of the season.	"We really didn't have a chance to get excited," manager Bryan Price said. "We couldn't put a lot of pressure on Wood."	Joc Pederson had a solo homer off Tim Adleman (4-3), who gave up two runs in six innings. Chris Taylor added an RBI double as the Dodgers won for the seventh time in their last eight games overall.	Justin Turner singled twice, walked twice and extended his hitting streak to 12 games. Wood singled home a run in the eighth off Drew Storen, slapping a pitch the opposite way to right field for his second hit of the season.	"I guess I closed my eyes and got a knock," Wood said.	DODGERS MOVE	RHP Josh Ravin was called up from Triple-A Oklahoma City for his second stint in the majors this season. He takes the place of RHP Ross Striplin, who was optioned.	A SCOOTER FOR SCOOTER	The Reds presented Scooter Gennett with a scooter -- driven onto the field by former pitcher Tom Browning -- during pregame ceremonies honoring his four-homer game. Gennett also received the jersey, hat and fourth home run ball from his game on June 6. He also caught a ceremonial pitch from 12-year-old Zach Thompson, who snagged the fourth homer in right field and presented it to Gennett.	DIVE IN	Pete Rose was shown on the videoboard between innings. The Reds will unveil a statue of the hits king outside Great American Ball Park on Saturday.	VOTTO HONORED, TOO	Fran�ois-Philippe Champagne, Canada's minister of international trade, presented Joey Votto with a certificate "in recognition of his contribution to friendly relations between Canada and the United States." Votto was born and lives in Toronto.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers:  Roberts said LHP Hyun-Jin Ryu (2-6), who is scheduled to start on Saturday, is fine physically. He made only one start last season because of shoulder surgery and elbow tendinitis.	Reds: RHP Homer Bailey threw a bullpen session on Friday. He's expected to make a rehab start on Monday for Triple-A Louisville. He's been sidelined since surgery to remove bone spurs from his elbow at the start of spring training.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: Ryu gave up four runs in only four innings during his start last Saturday against the Reds.	Reds: Asher Wojciechowski (1-0) makes his sixth career appearance and second straight start against the Dodgers. He gave up four runs in five innings of a 5-4 loss in LA last Saturday.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ATLANTA --  Dee Gordon isn't getting too excited about the Miami Marlins' recent success.	He vividly remembers the rough stretch last month when Miami lost 13 of 15.	"If you saw us a month ago, it wasn't pretty," Gordon said. "Now the difference is we're just playing hard and playing hard for each other."	Dan Straily pitched into the seventh inning, Christian Yelich drove in three runs and the Miami Marlins beat the Atlanta Braves 5-0 on Friday night.	Gordon went 3 for 5 and Justin Bour homered in his first game back from the disabled list as the Marlins moved into second place in the NL East, 10 games behind Washington. Miami has won 13 of 18.	Straily (5-4) was coming off his second-shortest outing of the season, but he kept the Braves guessing most of the night, allowing just four hits and striking out eight in 6 1/3 innings.	"I was able to control my fastball more than anything," Straily said. "That was something after the last couple of starts that we kind of focused on. It's something I was frustrated with. It comes down to fastball command, and other stuff plays a lot better."	Bour, reinstated from the 10-day disabled list before the game after missing nine games with a left ankle contusion, picked up where he left off. Since April 30, he is hitting .368 with 14 homers and 32 RBI.	Sean Newcomb (0-2) gave up three runs, five hits and three walks in six innings. He struck out four.	"He set the bar pretty high in the first (start last week), and I thought it was pretty good again," Braves manager Brian Snitker said. "This is a hot team. They've been playing good and scoring a lot of runs."	Newcomb got no support from his offense.	After scoring 29 runs in winning two of three at Washington this week, the Braves were punchless at the plate. They had one runner in scoring position -- Ender Inciarte in the first -- and missed a chance to tie it in the fifth when Dansby Swanson's long fly ball sailed just outside the left field foul pole.	Yelich had an RBI double and added a two-run single in the ninth. Bour's 17th homer made it 2-0 in the fourth. Miami led 3-0 in the sixth on a double play grounder.	The Braves have lost eight of 11 at home and have scored just nine runs in their last six games at SunTrust Park.	ON THE BASES	Gordon stole two bases to break a tie with Washington's Trea Turner and move into second place in the majors with 23 steals. Cincinnati's Billy Hamilton has 28.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: 3B Martin Prado and SS Adeiny Hechavarria have reported to Double-A Jacksonville to begin rehab assignments. Prado is on the DL for the second time this season with a strained right hamstring. Hechavarria has been sidelined since May 9 with a strained left oblique.	Braves: LF Matt Kemp is listed as day to day with a sore left hamstring and hopes to avoid the 10-day DL for the second time. Snitker said the team will wait a couple of days before reassessing Kemp's condition. Danny Santana took his spot in the field. ... Snitker added that RHP Bartolo Colon, on the DL with a strained left oblique, won't make a rehab appearance and is likely to start Wednesday against San Francisco.	UP NEXT	Marlins: LHP Jeff Locke (0-2) has a 5.44 ERA and two wins in eight career starts against Atlanta.	Braves: LHP Jaime Garcia (2-5) has a 1.49 ERA over his last five starts and is 1/3 over that span. In seven career starts against the Marlins, Garcia is 2-1 with a 3.60 ERA.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Tyson Ross wasn't going to rush his return to a major league mound and it paid off as the Texas Rangers defeated the Seattle Mariners 10-4 on Friday night.	Throughout his rehab process after surgery to correct Thoracic Outlet Syndrome, the right-handed pitcher had adopted a simple approach. He would take it day-by-day, evaluate each rehab start and would never push to get back too early.	"This was the perfect time right now," Ross said. "Everything leading up to today was a reason for everything I did. The struggles, successes all that, I'm looking to build on them even more."	The patient process worked as Ross allowed just a pair of runs in his first start in 14 months and Carlos Gomez homered to help the Rangers improve back to .500.	Ross (1-0) made his Rangers debut and started for the first time since opening day last year when he pitched for the Padres. It was his first win since Aug. 31, 2015 and he struck out five in 5 2/3 innings.	"Just every inning coming off the field you could tell there was emotion, passion, drive, excitement," Rangers manager Jeff Banister said. "You could also see it in everybody around him."	Gomez had four RBI after being sidelined four weeks with a strained right hamstring.	Ross walked the first batter he faced and allowed a run on an RBI groundout in the first, but settled down and didn't allow a hit until Mike Zunino's bloop single in the fifth.	Seattle starter James Paxton (5-2) allowed seven hits and seven runs in 3 2/3 innings. He ran into trouble in the third and threw 40 pitches as Texas scored five runs in the inning.	"We've got to get (Paxton) in a good spot, going in the right direction again," Mariners manager Scott Servais said. "The last couple he just hasn't looked comfortable out there. Everything looks like a struggle."	Elvis Andrus had an RBI double in the inning and then scored along with Shin-Soo Choo on a two-run single by Adrian Beltre. Beltre and Rougned Odor then scored on a single by Jonathan Lucroy as Texas took a 5-1 lead.	"Once the guys started swinging, I was just happy to be out there with the lead and continue to get outs and progress through the game," Ross said.	Robinson Chirinos homered and Gomez had an RBI double in the fourth to push the lead to 7-1. Gomez later homered to center on the first pitch he saw in the sixth inning, scoring Choo and Beltre.	"When we put those guys back in the lineup -- Gomez, Beltre, (Mike) Napoli -- the experience of these guys, there's no room to maneuver around," Banister said. "When we came out of spring training that's what we envisioned."	Ben Gamel scored in the first, sixth, and eighth innings for Seattle and Jarrod Dyson homered against Rangers reliever Jose Leclerc in the seventh.	RANGERS SIGN PICKS	Texas signed its first three selections from the 2017 Draft and held an introductory press conference for OF Bubba Thompson, SS Chris Seise, and RHP Hans Crouse.	Thompson was selected with the 26th pick of the first round and agreed to a $2.1 million signing bonus. Seise, the 29th pick, agreed to a $2 million bonus, and Crouse, the 66th overall pick, agreed to sign for $1.45 million.	TRAINERS ROOM	Mariners: RHP Felix Hernandez (strained oblique) is scheduled to make a rehab start with Triple-A Tacoma and throw 80 to 85 pitches. RHP Hishashi Iwakuma (shoulder inflammation) is scheduled to make potentially his final rehab start Monday. RHP Zac Curtis was recalled from Double-A Arkansas Friday.	Rangers: Reliever Tony Barnette was put on the 10-day DL with a sprained finger. RHP Dillon Gee was designated for assignment to make room for Ross on the 40-man roster. LHP Cole Hamels (oblique strain) made his first rehab start with Double-A Frisco allowing one hit and striking out three in three innings.	UP NEXT	Mariners: RHP Yovani Gallardo is making his 14th starts after picking up his third win in a 14-3 victory against Minnesota on June 12.	Rangers: LHP Martin Perez will be making his 14th start on five days extended rest and is looking for his first career win against Seattle.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

MILWAUKEE --  Milwaukee Brewers manager Craig Counsell gave a pretty apt description of Eric Thames' walk-off home run.	Thames hit the Brewers' first walk-off home run of the season in the bottom of the 10th inning, lifting Milwaukee to a 6-5 victory over the San Diego Padres on Friday night.	"I knew he hit it good and obviously really high," Counsell said of Thames' first career walk-off homer and the team's first since Martin Maldonado did it in a 17-inning win on May 31, 2015 against Arizona.	Thames' towering shot, his 19th of the season, came off a 1-1 pitch from Ryan Butcher (3-3) that bounced off the yellow padding on top of the left-field fence. The ball landed in the Brewers' bullpen setting off a raucous celebration at home plate.	"I got under it, but I got it good," Thames said. "I was like, hopefully, the wind is blowing out -- like, go, go, go!"	The retractable roof was closing as Thames started to circle the bases.	"I was kind of blowing a little," he said. "Guess it worked. Two home runs in two nights by a matter of inches. Ain't baseball a funny game."	Not to Butcher.	"He hit it," Butcher said. "He did his job."	Thames helped the Brewers beat the St. Louis Cardinals 6-4 Thursday with a two-run shot that just cleared the fence in right.	Jared Hughes (3-1) retired the side in order in the top of the 10th, helping the Brewers match their season-best four-game winning streak for the third time.	Manny Pi�a tied the game in the bottom of the eighth with a solo shot off Kirby Yates. Yangervis Solarte put the Padres ahead 5-4 in the top of the inning with his seventh home run this season.	Milwaukee starter Junior Guerra made two big mistakes in the first inning. Wil Myers hit a three-run homer and Hunter Renfroe followed with his 15th, snapping a tie with Nate Colbert (1969) for the most rookie home runs before the All-Star break in franchise history.	Guerra allowed three earned runs over six innings, walked four and struck out three in his fifth start since coming off the disabled list on May 25 with a right calf strain. He suffered the injury legging out a sacrifice bunt on Opening Day.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: RHP Jered Weaver (left hip inflammation) and OF Manuel Margot (strained right calf) are making progress. Margot worked out and is scheduled to run the bases on Saturday. Weaver threw a simulated game and reported that he felt pretty good.	Brewers: OF Ryan Braun (left calf strain) has advanced to doing a full pregame workout. ... INF Jonathan Villar (lower back strain) won't be back soon despite playing catch.	BROXTON'S BOMBS	Broxton made it consecutive games with long-distance home runs. His three-run blast off Miguel Diaz traveled 449 feet. Thursday, he belted the longest home run in the history of Busch Stadium, a clout that traveled 489 feet.	It's the second longest homer in the majors this season. The New York Yankees' Aaron Judge belted one that traveled 495 feet on June 11.	VOTE OF CONFIDENCE FOR DIAZ	Miguel Diaz made 21 relief appearances before his first major league start for the Padres on June 10, a two-inning scoreless stint against the Kansas City Royals. Facing the Brewers, he wilted with one out in the fourth. Broxton's three-run homer tied the game at 4 and Lewis Brinson snapped a 1-for-14 streak with a triple that chased Diaz, a 2011 non-drafted free agent signed by Milwaukee. Travis Shaw went deep in the second for his 12th home run of the season.	"He's impressive," Myers said of Diaz. "Just a couple of pitches there kind of unraveled. He's going to figure it out. He's got great stuff with a live arm."	UP NEXT	Padres: RHP Dinelson Lamet (2-2, 8.50 ERA) makes the fifth start of his career, third on the road and first against the Brewers.	Brewers: RHP Chase Anderson (5-2, 2.83 ERA) looks to bounce back from an 11-1 drubbing at Arizona on Sunday. He faces the Padres for the second time this season and is 3-1 with a 4.02 ERA in seven career starts against them. He took a no-decision on May 15 at Petco Park.	---	More AP baseball:	https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

MINNEAPOLIS --  The surprising Minnesota Twins have had at least a share of first place in the AL Central since May 11. However, their lack of starting pitching depth might be starting to show.	Carlos Carrasco pitched one-hit ball into the sixth inning, Jose Ramirez had three hits and Edwin Encarnacion homered as the Cleveland Indians beat the pitching-thin Twins 8-1 Friday night.	The Indians pulled a game behind the Twins at the top of the division standings, and they certainly have the pitching advantage in this four-game weekend series. Minnesota's first three starters began the series with 13 combined career starts, while Sunday's starter, Kyle Gibson, was demoted to Triple-A earlier this year after a poor start to the season.	"We talked about shaping up the rotation a couple of weeks ago," said Twins manager Paul Molitor, who's lost starters Phil Hughes and Hector Santiago due to injury. "I didn't think we'd be running the guys out there that we are."	Minnesota's top two starters, Ervin Santana and Jose Berrios, are pitching like potential All-Stars thus far. But they started Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, leaving the Twins scrambling for starting pitchers this weekend amid a stretch of 35 games in 34 days going into the All-Star break.	On Friday they turned to Nik Turley (0-1), a 27-year-old journeyman who was making his second major league appearance. The lefty allowed eight runs on nine hits with four walks and a hit batter in 4 2/3 innings. Encarnacion's upper-deck blast came on the first pitch after Turley had set the table by walking Jason Kipnis and Francisco Lindor.	"You can't defend walk, walk, homer," Molitor said.	Meanwhile, Carrasco (7-2) was rolling. He gave up four hits in 6 1/3 innings, with three walks and seven strikeouts. The only run he allowed came on Eddie Rosario's solo homer leading off the sixth, but by then his offense had already given him eight runs to work with.	"Those guys went out there and got some runs, so the only thing we had to do as a pitching staff is come in there and throw up zeroes on the board," Carrasco said. "That's what we try to do every game. That's what we're here for."	Indians manager Terry Francona praised his starter for battling through early command problems and pitching into the seventh inning, allowing him to use only two relievers on the night.	"He got us deep enough into the game where, when you're going into a four-game series with a doubleheader (Saturday), the last thing you want is to be going to your bullpen early," Francona said.	ED-HOT	Encarnacion's home run was his 14th of the season and continued his hot streak the past month. He stumbled out of the gate in his first season after coming over from the Toronto Blue Jays, hitting just .198 with five home runs in the first six weeks of the season.	But since May 16, Encarnacion is hitting .337 (30-for-89) with nine homers and 19 RBI.	"He had a really slow start," said Francona, "but that slow start's over."	GO DADDY	The Indians were without starting left fielder Michael Brantley, who left the team Thursday to attend the birth of his son. Brantley will miss the entire series against the Twins and is expected to rejoin the team on Monday in Baltimore.	The team filled the roster vacancy by recalling right-handed pitcher Adam Plutko from Triple-A Columbus. He will provide depth in the Cleveland bullpen as the teams play four games in a 48-hour span this weekend.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: OF Brandon Guyer, who has been sidelined list since May 13 with a sprained left wrist, began a rehab assignment Friday at Columbus.	Twins: Santiago will throw again in the bullpen on Saturday before the Twins decide on his next steps. Santiago was put on the 10-day DL on June 7 with a strained left shoulder.	UP NEXT	Indians: RHP Steve Clevenger (2-3, 4.09 ERA) and LHP Nate Merritt (making his 2017 debut) will be Cleveland's starting pitchers in Saturday's day-night doubleheader at Target Field. The team did not announce which pitcher will start which game.	Twins: LHP Adam Wilk (0-1, 1.86) will start Game 1 and fellow lefty Adalberto Mejia (1-2, 5.75) will take the mound for the nightcap against Cleveland.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

Betts hit a tiebreaking home run in the eighth inning, sending the Boston Red Sox over the Houston Astros 2-1.	"Home run came at a big time, but I think more fun, probably the throw," Betts said. "You don't get those opportunities very much. For me to be successful that time, is definitely something I take pride in."	Betts hit his team-leading 12th homer, and third in three games. He led off with a drive into the Crawford Boxes in left field, connecting against Will Harris (2-2).	"He cuts down a run  to finish the sixth, then the first pitch thrown in eighth, he gives us the lead," Boston manager John Farrell said. "Just in a small snapshot, there's Mookie's skill set on both sides of the ball. He's a dynamic player. Those throws aren't just by coincidence. The work he puts in, he throws a strike from right field at a key point in the game right there."	Houston manager A.J. Hinch said it was an aggressive send to wave Springer, who was easily tagged out at home in the sixth.	"Getting thrown out like that at that distance you're betting on a mistake," Hinch said. "It was a one-hopper bullet hit right at Betts. Betts makes a nice throw and they make the play."	Brian McCann tied it for Houston in the seventh, homering into the upper deck in right field off Drew Pomeranz.	Joe Kelly (3-0) got two outs for the win. He retired Norichika Aoki on a liner to third with runners on second and third to end the seventh.	Craig Kimbrel threw a perfect ninth for his 19th save.	Mitch Moreland gave Boston a 1-0 lead with a single in the third that drove in Betts.	Pomeranz allowed four hits and struck out four in 6 1/3 innings. He rebounded nicely after allowing six runs in 4 1/3 innings in his last start.	"I think my fastball location was a little better," Pomeranz said. "The breaking stuff was a little sharper, and I was a little more accurate with it. I think that goes a long way when I can place those where I want."	Mike Fiers allowed one run on five hits with four strikeouts in seven innings. He set down his final 10 batters.	"I was locked in all game; I felt really good. Just another game of getting ahead in the count and being the aggressor," Fiers said. "Not letting these guys get in too many hitters' counts and putting them away as early as you can and not try to go deep into the at-bat."	The right-hander continued his string of good outings, allowing two runs or less in each of his last four starts.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: INF Hanley Ramirez was out of the lineup Friday with a muscle spasm in his neck. . Moreland is playing through a fractured big toe on his left foot. . RHP Carson Smith (Tommy John) will not make his scheduled rehab start Sunday due shoulder inflammation, Farrell said.	Astros: RHP Charlie Morton (right lat strain) and RHP Collin McHugh (right elbow) each threw bullpen sessions. ... LHP Dallas Keuchel (neck discomfort) and RHP Lance McCullers (lower back discomfort) could begin playing catch soon, Hinch said. Hinch said he hopes to have them start a throwing program as early as this weekend. . OF Josh Reddick (concussion) resumed baseball activities Friday, Hinch said.	HE SAID IT	"We knew coming in here this is going to be a strong test, a strong challenge. To pitch like we did tonight in their home ballpark, that was encouraging." -- Farrell on facing the Astros, who have the best record in the Majors.	UP NEXT	Red Sox: RHP Rick Porcello (3-8) makes his 15th start of the season Saturday looking to break a three-game losing streak and rebound after giving up 11 runs over his last two starts.	Astros: RHP David Paulino (0-0) will make his fourth start this season Saturday looking to bounce back after being tagged for five runs in four innings in his last outing.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

DENVER --  Ian Desmond picked a good time to get his first home run at Coors Field as a member of the Colorado Rockies.	Desmond hit a game-changing three-run homer in the fifth and finished with four RBI to help the Rockies beat the San Francisco Giants 10-8 on Friday night.	Colorado rookie Antonio Senzatela battled through six innings to tie for the major league lead in wins, and DJ LeMahieu had four hits for the second straight game for the Rockies, who have won seven straight over the Giants.	Desmond, who signed a five-year, $70 million contract in the offseason, hasn't showed much power after starting the season on the disabled list. Friday's homer was just his fifth but it gave the Rockies a lead they never ceded.	"Our pitchers have been carrying us all year long and I just want to pick them up," Desmond said. "That's all we want to do. To be able to deliver with two strikes, we needed that. For me it was nice to help out Senzatela and the team."	Senzatela (9-2) tied Clayton Kershaw, Dallas Keuchel and Jason Vargas for the most wins despite giving up three home runs. Joe Panik, who also doubled twice, and Denard Span had solo shots and starter Jeff Samardzija (2-9) hit a two-run homer that gave the Giants a 4-1 lead in the fifth.	"It wasn't a really good game for me but we won. That's good," Senzatela said. "I tried to keep the game close and we were hitting good. I pitched six innings but I put the team in a bad situation but they support me and put us back in the game."	The Rockies rallied for five runs in the bottom of the fifth, three on Desmond's homer. Trevor Story hit a pinch-hit homer in the sixth and Desmond had a sacrifice fly in Colorado's three-run seventh.	The Giants got two in the eighth and one more in the ninth off closer Greg Holland, who earned his major league best 24th save.	San Francisco has lost four straight and 13 of 17 to fall 17 games below .500.	"We had the winning run up there," manager Bruce Bochy said. "We just can't finish it off."	Bochy was ejected by home plate umpire Gary Cederstrom in the top of the seventh for arguing balls and strikes after Samardzija walked LeMahieu in a seven-pitch battle.	"Listen, we're in the seventh inning. Lot of emotions," Samardzija said. "I was out there fighting. That's the way it goes sometimes."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Giants: LHP Madison Bumgarner is scheduled to throw a bullpen session in Arizona on Saturday. He has been out since mid-April with a left shoulder AC strain suffered in a dirt bike accident in Colorado.	Rockies: RHP Chad Bettis threw a 20-pitch bullpen session Friday in his road back from cancer treatment. Bettis, who led the Rockies pitchers in wins last season, has been out while receiving chemotherapy for testicular cancer. "He's feeling good, there's a smile on his face," manager Bud Black said. "We love having him around."	BEST-CASE SCENARIO	Giants catcher Buster Posey and infielder Eduardo Nunez were feeling fine after both left Thursday's game with injuries. Posey hurt his left ankle hitting a home run but didn't need an MRI or X-ray. He walked as a pinch-hitter Friday.	"I don't know if we could have gotten better news because he was in a lot of pain," Bochy said. "I thought it was going to be quite a while but we got the news much later that he's doing so much better. It was a little bit of an impingement, maybe some scar tissue."	UP NEXT	Giants: RHP Matt Cain (3-5, 5.22 ERA) will make his 39th career start against the Rockies, the most by any pitcher in major league history. He is 17-10 with a 3.52 ERA all-time against Colorado.	Rockies: Rookie RHP Kyle Freeland (7-4, 3.57 ERA) tossed seven shutout innings in his only start against San Francisco on April 23 at Coors Field.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- The disappointment of having his first career hit taken away by instant replay lasted only a few innings for Matt Chapman. He ended up delivering a much more memorable first hit.	Chapman hit a go-ahead two-run single in the eighth inning after having an earlier hit overturned and the Oakland Athletics rallied for a 7-6 victory over the New York Yankees on Friday night.	"I guess having your first hit taken away from you, just was waiting for something sweeter," he said.	Chapman bounced back from the second-inning disappointment by delivering in the clutch in his second career game. After the Yankees intentionally walked Stephen Vogt to load the bases with one out, Chapman hit a hard grounder down the third-base line against Jonathan Holder (1-1) that scored two runs.	"It was exciting," he said. "Everything seems to happen pretty fast for your first time. It was exciting looking in the dugout and seeing my teammates fired up. It was a pretty cool experience, and trying to stay in the game while having all that hit you was pretty cool."	Aaron Judge hit his major league-leading 23rd homer and Chris Carter added a solo shot for the Yankees, who have lost a season-high four straight games.	"Every team's going to go through it," manager Joe Girardi said. "I'm pleased with the way we keep fighting back and that will bode well during the course of the season. Right now our bullpen's been in a little bit of disarray. We'll get that straightened out."	New York appeared in good shape to snap its skid after overcoming a 4-0 deficit with help from Judge's three-run homer. They took the lead on Carter's leadoff shot in the sixth and added an insurance run when Judge tripled and scored on a single to Starlin Castro in the seventh.	But that's all they got and ended up on the losing end again.	"It's been a tough stretch for us but we're still playing good ball," Carter said. "It's just that time of year right now where we're having a tough stretch."	Chad Pinder hit a sacrifice fly in the bottom of the seventh and Chapman delivered the big hit in the eighth to give the A's the lead one night after striking out with the bases loaded to send the game to extra innings.	"The kid is here for a reason," manager Bob Melvin said. "We've seen in spring training he's a tough kid. He wants to play, he likes to play. He's not afraid of the situations."	Daniel Coulombe (1-1) got four outs for the win and Santiago Casilla pitched the ninth for his 11th save in 14 chances.	Chapman appeared to have his first career hit when he was initially ruled safe on a slow roller to third base in a four-run second inning. The A's saved the ball as a memento but the Yankees challenged the play and Chapman was called out. Chapman did record his first career RBI on the play as Yonder Alonso scored from third on the play.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: C Gary Sanchez (groin) and OF Aaron Hicks (left Achilles) were held out of the lineup and are day to day. ... RHP Adam Warren was placed on the DL with right shoulder inflammation. ... 1B Greg Bird will see a foot specialist next Tuesday after getting pulled from his rehab assignment Thursday. ... Closer Aroldis Chapman (left shoulder) threw 20 pitches on a rehab assignment for Double-A Trenton and could be activated Sunday.	Athletics: SS Marcus Semien took batting practice for the first time since undergoing right wrist surgery on April 18 and could begin a rehab assignment in a week.	STREAK BROKEN	A's starter Sean Manaea had his streak of winning five straight starts broken by a no-decision. He allowed five runs in six innings, equaling the number of runs he had allowed in his previous four starts.	REPLAY	The Yankees won two replay challenges, taking a hit away from Chapman and leading to a double play in the eighth inning. The A's lost their only challenge on a play at second base and are now 4-11 in challenges this season.	"I don't get replay anymore. I don't," Melvin said. "Everyone today looked like it should have gone the other way for us. Don't get me started on replay."	UP NEXT	Girardi said he hasn't decided whether he will start Masahiro Tanaka or possibly bring Luis Cessa out of the bullpen on Saturday. The A's will start Jesse Hahn.	---	More AP baseball: www.apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Ian Kennedy and Cliff Pennington are former teammates and good buddies, although that second relationship could be up for review after Pennington's homer broke up Kennedy's bid for a perfect game.	"He's a terrible friend of mine," Kennedy said with a laugh. "I'm probably deleting him from my phone."	Kennedy probably won't have to do anything that drastic, thanks to Lorenzo Cain's latest feats of prowess for the streaking Kansas City Royals.	Cain hit two homers and drove in three runs, and Kennedy retired the first 17 Angels to end his 16-start winless skid in the Royals' sixth consecutive victory, 3-1 over Los Angeles on Friday night.	Kennedy (1-6) pitched six innings of two-hit ball and stayed perfect until Pennington hit his first homer since last August. Kennedy was winless in his first 11 starts this season, but he escaped a subsequent sixth-inning jam and hung on for his first victory since Sept. 11, 2016.	"It feels really good," Kennedy said of ending his skid. "I knew (about the streak). Some guys in (the clubhouse) didn't know. It's nice to get one, and hopefully more will come from there. I was ahead and attacking. Since I've been here, that's the best I've pitched for sure."	The USC product and native of nearby Huntington Beach also beat the Angels for the first time in six career starts.	Kennedy's winless streak was the third-longest in Royals history. Philadelphia's Jerad Eickhoff is the only remaining winless pitcher in the majors with at least 10 starts.	Kelvin Herrera pitched the ninth for his 14th save in 16 chances for Kansas City, which improved to 5-0 against the Angels this season.	SUGAR CAIN	Cain posted the fifth multi-homer game of his career and his second in a week, connecting for solo shots in the third and eighth innings. He also drove in Alex Gordon with a two-out single in the fifth.	The Royals' longest winning streak of the season has coincided with Cain's tear through California. The slugger has eight hits and six RBI in three games starting Wednesday in San Francisco, and he has six homers in his last six games since June 10 in San Diego.	"I'm just swinging at better pitches," Cain said. "We're all playing better now. We definitely got off to a rough start, as we all know, but we've been saying it's going to be a long season. We're going to continue to battle."	CHAVEZ GETS HIT	Jesse Chavez (5-7) yielded nine hits over seven innings, but he has allowed at least one homer in 12 straight appearances dating to April 21, extending the longest active streak in the majors.	CLIFF'S HIT	After the Angels didn't really come close to a hit in their first 17 at-bats, Pennington smashed a belt-high, 3-1 fastball into the elevated right field stands.	"We all knew that it was going on," Pennington said of his friend's perfect game bid. "That's one of the few times he fell behind (in the count), and he came at me with a good pitch to hit."	The utilityman got his first extra-base hit of the season and his first homer in 78 games since Aug. 11, 2016.	"It's just a fluky thing," Pennington said. "Maybe I'll rattle off 10 in a row here real quick."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals: LHP Danny Duffy continued his recovery from a strained oblique muscle by throwing a side session back in Kansas City. He'll throw again next week.	Angels: Reliever Cam Bedrosian expects to be activated from the disabled list Saturday. He has missed 53 games since April 22 with a strained groin. ... Reliever Huston Street pitched one perfect inning for Triple-A Salt Lake. He hasn't played for the Angels this season due to a strained lateral muscle. ... Matt Shoemaker is improving after exiting his last start early with tightness in his forearm, but manager Mike Scioscia feels it's unlikely that the right-hander will make his next start as scheduled.	UP NEXT	Royals: Jakob Junis (2-0, 4.67 ERA) makes his fourth start and sixth appearance of the season. He has also made seven Triple-A starts between his four stints with the big-league club.	Angels: Alex Meyer (2-3, 4.05 ERA) continues to establish himself as a rotation regular, although he couldn't get out of the fifth inning against the Yankees in his last start.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

TORONTO -- Mike Pelfrey picked up another road win and helped the Chicago White Sox secure another series win against the Toronto Blue Jays.	Pelfrey (3-5) earned his second road win of the season, limiting Toronto to one run and four hits in a season high-tying six innings. He retired 10 straight batters between the second and sixth innings to outpitch the Blue Jays' Marcus Stroman (7-3).	"I knew coming in today that the crowd would be pretty good because of the guy on the other side," he said. "Stroman's pretty good but luckily he made a couple of mistakes and the boys took advantage of it."	Todd Frazier and Matt Davidson hit consecutive homers to start the second inning, and Jose Abreu added a solo shot in the sixth to help the White Sox win their fourth straight series against the Blue Jays. It was Chicago's sixth straight win at Toronto and the ninth in the last 10 meetings overall.	"I think that's his best start for us today," manager Rick Renteria said, "especially because he continued to throw strikes effectively through the fifth and even the sixth."	The bullpen came through down the stretch for Chicago, particularly Tommy Kahnle, who steered the White Sox out of a jam in the seventh inning when the Blue Jays got within one run with runners aboard. But Kahnle got Ryan Goins to hit into the double-play to end the threat.	"That was huge because they had the go-ahead run at first and the tying run at second," Kahnle said. "I was just trying to get Goins to get that double-play ball and it ended up working out for us."	Frazier snapped an 0-for-18 drought with his 11th homer to open the scoring. Davidson followed that up with his fifth home run in six games, and team-leading 15th, the fourth time this season the White Sox have hit consecutive home runs. Abreu's was his 11th of the season.	Stroman gave up six hits and a career-high-tying three home runs in seven innings. He walked one and struck out five in his first loss since April 18 at Boston. The Blue Jays are now 0-5 when Stroman starts against the White Sox.	"I felt pretty good," the right-hander said. "They put some good swings on a couple of balls, but other than that I felt pretty good today."	Blue Jays manager John Gibbons felt his starter deserved better after a good outing where he did his job.	"We couldn't get enough offense going, obviously," Gibbons said. "The ball is flying, some pretty good hitters, they swing it over there, they've got some big strong dudes who can do that."	BLUES BROTHERS	To commemorate Father's Day this weekend, both teams wore baby blue caps, with matching numbers logos, belts and various other accessories.	OPEN-AND-SHUT CASE	With the loss, the Blue Jays fell to 2-6 in home games where the Rogers Centre roof has been open for a portion of the game. For the second straight day the roof was closed midway through the game due to impending thunderstorms.	ROAD SHOW	All 11 of Abreu's home runs have come on the road this season. The first baseman hasn't had a homer at home since Sept. 15 last year against Cleveland, a stretch of 34 games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: RHP Aaron Sanchez came through a 25-pitch bullpen session on Friday with no problem as he continues to progress from blister issues on his pitching hand. Manager John Gibbons said that 24-year-old would have one more bullpen before heading down to the minors to continue his rehab. . One day after returning from the DL, OF Steve Pearce was given the day off. Dwight Smith Jr. took his place in the lineup. . After catching three straight games, Russell Martin also sat out Saturday, with Luke Maile suiting up behind the plate.	UP NEXT	White Sox: RHP James Shields (1-0, 1.62) makes just his fourth start of the season and first since going on the DL with a strained right lat on April 21.	Blue Jays: LHP J.A. Happ (1-4, 4.31) has a 15-6 record in games following six or more days' rest. His last start came June 11 at Seattle, where he registered his first win of the season.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DENVER --  Kyle Freeland gave up hits and even got hit, but the rookie gave the surging Colorado Rockies the outing they needed.	Freeland pitched six solid innings and shook off a liner off his pitching arm, Tony Wolters drove in two runs and the Colorado Rockies beat the San Francisco Giants again, 5-1 on Saturday.	The Rockies are 9-1 against San Francisco this season and have won the last eight against the Giants. Colorado had 14 hits but only one for extra bases, a double by pinch-hitter Pat Valaika in the seventh inning.	"A lot of singles today. That tells me there was some pretty good pitching," Rockies manager Bud Black said.	Freeland (8-4) wasn't as sharp as his seven shutout innings against San Francisco on April 23 but he held the Giants to one run and eight hits despite pitching in traffic in every inning. The rookie left-hander left with a 2-1 lead and pumped his fist after striking out pinch-hitter Brandon Belt to end the sixth with a runner on second.	"He pumped me up," Wolters said. "He jumped off that mound, started fist pumping. I love that energy about him."	Freeland had a scary moment in the fourth when Joe Panik's line drive up the middle hit him near his elbow and then glanced off his biceps. The trainer looked at him and after one warmup pitch he said he was fine.	"A little knotted up but I'll be alright," Freeland said. "I didn't know if it was going to swell up immediately or have structural damage but they ran a couple of tests out there and it was fine."	Giants starter Matt Cain took a shot off Carlos Gonzalez's bat in the fourth but staye in the game.	Nolan Arenado made it 3-1 with a single in the sixth and Wolters and Valaika had two-out hits in the seventh to stretch the lead to 5-1. All six runs in the game were scored with two outs.	Cain (3-6), winless since May 15, lost for the fifth time in six starts and Joe Panik had three hits for the Giants, who have lost five straight and 14 of 18.	Panik was denied a fourth hit when first baseman Mark Reynolds caught his liner and stepped on first to double off Kelby Tomlinson to end the game.	"We're not doing enough to win the ballgames," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "We score 17 runs in the first two games and we can't get a win, and we get a pretty good pitching job and we get one run today. That's kind of how it's gone for us."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Giants: LHP Madison Bumgarner (left AC shoulder strain) threw a 40-pitch bullpen session in Arizona on Saturday. Bochy said he will have another session in a few days. ... C Buster Posey started at 1B to take stress off his sore left ankle.	Rockies: LHP Tyler Anderson (left knee inflammation) was scheduled to throw 75 pitches in a rehab start for Triple-A Albuquerque and RHP Jon Gray (stress fracture, right foot) is slated for a rehab start for Albuquerque on Monday. If things go well both could rejoin the Rockies rotation next week.	STREAK SNAPPED	Arenado's misplay of Nick Hundley's grounder in the second inning was his first error of the season. Arenado's 71-game errorless streak, which included the last three games of 2016, was the third longest by a third baseman in club history. Vinny Castilla went 75 games without an error in 2004 and Jeff Cirillo's 85-game errorless streak in 2001 tops the list.	Arenado quickly atoned by fielding Aaron Hill's grounder to start a double play.	FRIENDLY FIRE	Hundley had a minor collision with Wolters in the fourth inning. Hundley scored on a single and glanced off Wolters as he crossed the plate.	When Wolters came to bat in the bottom of the inning Hundley gave him a fist bump to express no hard feelings.	"I was trying to deke him, got close and then just bumped," Wolters said. "There wasn't anything from it. He's my big brother. He was here and helped me out."	UP NEXT	Giants: LHP Ty Blach (4-4, 4.24 ERA) will make his first start and fifth appearance against the Rockies on Sunday. The Denver native has tossed six scoreless innings in his career against the Rockies.	Rockies: RHP Tyler Chatwood (6-7, 4.16 ERA) will start for the third time against the Giants on Sunday. Chatwood is 2-4 with a 7.03 ERA at home this season.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

BALTIMORE --  During a miserable stretch that dropped them into a last-place tie in the AL East, the Baltimore Orioles endured a familiar scenario: A poor outing by their starting pitcher put them in a quick hole, and an overworked bullpen allowed the deficit to grow.	The Orioles flipped the script on the St. Louis Cardinals in a 15-7 victory Saturday.	Jonathan Schoop homered twice and drove in four runs, Manny Machado went deep in a seven-run second inning against Adam Wainwright and the Orioles cruised after building a 12-3 lead in the fourth inning.	"When your starter goes out and lays an egg you're going to have a hard time winning the game," Wainwright said. "I pitched terrible and we were behind the 8-ball right away."	Adam Jones and Mark Trumbo got Baltimore started with successive first-inning shots, and Schoop finished the Orioles' long-ball display with drives in the fourth and seventh .	In dropping eight of their previous nine games, Baltimore absorbed lopsided losses of 8-2, 16-3, 14-3 and 11-2. In this one, the Orioles took advantage of a struggling starting pitcher and added to the advantage against a trio of relievers.	Wade Miley (3-4) picked up his second win since April 14 despite allowing six runs, five earned, in 5 2/3 innings.	Afterward, he acknowledged that his job was made easier by the performance of Baltimore's offense.	"It put us in a situation where I can go out there and kind of relax and try to get outs," the left-hander said. "Obviously they scored some runs, but at the same time, we scored more than they did."	Wainwright (7-5) gave up nine runs and seven hits, including three home runs, over 1 2/3 innings -- the shortest of his 268 career starts. The nine runs and three homers matched the most he's allowed in any outing.	"This is the last park you want to pitch in if you're throwing the ball right down the middle with not much action on it," Wainwright said. "Today was pathetic."	It was the 11th loss in 16 games for the Cardinals, who got home runs from Paul DeJong, Yadier Molina and Dexter Fowler.	Baltimore led 2-1 before sending 11 batters to the plate in the second. J.J. Hardy and Trey Mancini each hit a two-run double, Schoop singled in a run and Machado delivered a two-run homer.	After the Orioles built a nine-run cushion, Molina hit a solo homer in the fifth and Fowler connected with two on in the sixth before Mychal Givens struck out Eric Fryer with the bases loaded.	Not long after that, Baltimore celebrated a blowout victory of its own.	"It was really good, a really good feeling," Schoop said. "Hopefully we can keep it up."	FIELDING GEM	Machado snared a grounder down the line in the eighth inning and drifted past the coaching box before rifling a throw that got Jedd Gyorko at first base.	"To make it even better, I had a good look at it. It's probably a foul ball," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.	SEEN `EM ALL	The Orioles were the only major league club that Wainwright had not faced over his 12-year career with the Cardinals. Baltimore remains one of only five teams he has never beaten (along with the Yankees, Twins, Indians and Rangers).	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: RHP Michael Wacha appears healthy enough to make his next start. "He's in doing his normal two-days after workout. It seems like everything was going fine," manager Mike Matheny said.	Orioles: 1B Chris Davis (oblique strain) will likely be sidelined through the All-Star break, Showalter said. ... INF Ryan Flaherty (right shoulder inflammation) has started a throwing program at the Orioles minor league facility in Sarasota, Florida. ... RHP Mike Wright (shoulder) received a cortisone injection in his shoulder Friday and will be shut down for at least three days.	UP NEXT	Cardinals: RHP Lance Lynn (5-2, 2.69 ERA) starts the series finale. He's coming off his third scoreless start of the season, on Tuesday in Milwaukee.	Orioles: RHP Ubaldo Jimenez (1-2, 6.71 ERA) makes his first start since May 22. He's made four relief appearances since then, allowing eight runs in 13 2/3 innings.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  Even as Ryon Healy tinkers with his plate approach, teammates think the Oakland third baseman deserves All-Star consideration.	Easy to see why on days like this.	Healy went deep twice for his third multihomer game in two weeks, Matt Joyce also hit a long ball and the Athletics beat the New York Yankees 5-2 on Saturday.	"I think it's been really impressive, obviously, what he did today, but what he's done as a whole this season," Oakland reliever Sean Doolittle said after Healy hit his eighth home run in 14 games. "I don't think he got off to the start he wanted to, at least in April. You look at the scoreboard now and look where his numbers are at ... you could put him in the All-Star conversation."	Healy hit a tying solo home run in the second inning, then put the A's up with his 17th home run leading off the fourth. The slugger also had two home runs against Washington on June 3 and against Toronto on June 5.	It's the fifth time this season that Healy, who singled in the seventh, has had three hits or more in a game.	"I still think it's getting there," Healy said. "I'm not satisfied with the consistency of it. There are things that I'm still not doing well enough on a day-to-day basis. Fortunately, I'm still able to go out and compete."	Joyce reached base five times, Jesse Hahn (3-4) pitched five innings to defeat New York for the first time in his career and Jed Lowrie had an RBI single to keep the A's rolling at home. Oakland has won six of its last eight at the Coliseum, including three straight against the Yankees.	Joyce homered leading off the game against Masahiro Tanaka (5-7). It was Joyce's fifth career leadoff homer and first since Sept. 24, 2013 -- also against the Yankees.	Austin Romine and Brett Gardner drove in runs for New York, which has lost a season-high five straight. The Yankees entered the day with a one-game lead over Boston in the AL East.	Hahn had an uneven outing but stuck around long enough to win his second straight. The right-hander allowed two runs and three hits and had six strikeouts, including two against home run leader Aaron Judge.	Four relievers pitched one inning apiece to complete the five-hitter. Sean Doolittle retired three batters for his second save.	Tanaka had an up-and-down day while losing to the A's for the second time this season. Tanaka struck out 10 but allowed five runs and eight hits -- including three homers -- over four innings.	"Mistakes," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "A splitter that didn't do what it's supposed to, a slider that didn't do what it's supposed to, both of those to Healy."	ROUGH DAY	Khris Davis struck out four times for Oakland and got some boos for lack of hustle on another out. Davis sulked out of the batter's box and back toward the dugout after popping a ball up near home plate in the third inning. Wind appeared to blow the ball back toward fair territory, and third baseman Chase Headley dropped the ball just as he crossed into fair territory. Catcher Romine picked it up and threw to first base to retire Davis, who hung his head as he continued to walk toward the dugout.	CASILLA HIT IN DUGOUT	A's closer Santiago Casilla had to be taken to the clubhouse to be examined by the team's medical staff after appearing to get hit by a foul ball while sitting in the home dugout. Casilla lay prone in the dugout for a few moments before being helped to his feet and going for X-rays that were negative.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: Top prospect Gleyber Torres was removed from a game with Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre following a play at the plate. Torres dove awkwardly around the catcher in the fourth inning and appeared to injure his left arm. He immediately grabbed the arm in significant pain. ... Matt Holliday was scratched because of an allergic reaction. ... Aroldis Chapman made it through his rehab appearance without setback and is expected to be activated from the disabled list Sunday. ... Girardi said he expects OF Aaron Hicks (left leg tightness) back in the lineup for the series finale Sunday. ... Jacoby Ellsbury (concussion) is increasing his baseball activity and will take batting practice and expand his running routine in the next few days.	Athletics: Marcus Semien (wrist surgery) could begin a rehab assignment when Oakland heads out for a six-game trip June 23.	UP NEXT	Yankees RHP Luis Cessa (0-0, 5.40), originally scheduled to start on Saturday, will instead make his first major league start on Sunday. The A's will counter with RHP Jharel Cotton (3-7, 5.52).	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

PHILADELPHIA --  The Arizona Diamondbacks are playing carefree, and it's showing in the win column.	Paul Goldschmidt hit a two-run double and also made a key catch, boosting the Diamondbacks over the Philadelphia Phillies 5-1 Saturday for Arizona's sixth straight victory.	The Diamondbacks improved to 43-26, matching the best 69-game start in team history.	"You just don't press and trust the whole team," said Jake Lamb, whose third-inning single upped his MLB-leading RBI total to 59. "There's just no panic in the dugout."	Philadelphia has lost six in a row to Arizona and 10 of 11 overall.	Daniel Descalso hit a go-ahead single in a four-run seventh inning.	Jorge De La Rosa (3-1) won in relief of Zack Godley, who struck out a career-high eight in 5 2/3 innings.	"He looked gross," Lamb said of Godley. "That's what he does. Nothing's straight."	Jerad Eickhoff pitched six strong innings for the Phillies, allowing one run on five hits, but remained winless this season. He has the worst run support among NL starters, the Phillies have tallied less than two runs in six of his 14 starts. The last Phillies starter to begin a season without a win in as many starts was Matt Beech in 1997.	Edubray Ramos (0-4) relieved Eickhoff and gave up the first three runs of Arizona's four-run seventh.	Rey Fuentes led off with a single, and was safe at second when catcher Andrew Knapp failed to get him on De La Rosa's sacrifice bunt. The play proved pivotal as Descalso followed with a tiebreaking single.	"I would've preferred he went to first but, hey, I'm not going to fault him for trying to be aggressive," Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said. "I just think he should've went to first."	"That was the catalyst of the big inning," Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said.	Goldschmidt's double made it 4-1 and Brandon Drury added an RBI single.	The Phillies threatened in the bottom half, loading the bases with two outs for Michael Saunders. But Goldschmidt made an outstanding catch at first base, lunging toward the line on Saunders' drive.	The catch was part of an all-around team effort.	"The guys on our team do a good job of getting themselves to play every day and we haven't carried over wins or losses," Goldschmidt said. "Everyone just shows up and takes care of their business. We've done a good job of showing up and no matter what happened the day before, good or bad, just kind of letting it go."	Philadelphia left 13 runners on base.	The game was delayed 50 minutes at the start due to rain.	ON THE DEFENSIVE	Arizona shortstop Chris Owings made fine plays to end the third and fourth innings.	"Those were big plays," Goldschmidt said. "I didn't really think he was going to get any of them and he made both of them and pretty easily. That's a great job and what we need to win."	STILL STREAKING	Tommy Joseph extended his hitting streak to 13 games for the Phillies. He is batting .346 over the stretch.	FOR STARTERS	Godley's outing kept Arizona starters without a defeat over their last nine starts. They are 7-0 with a 2.64 ERA over the stretch dating back to June 6.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: OF A.J. Pollock (strained right groin) was scheduled to make his first rehab appearance on Saturday night with Triple-A Reno. He has been on the DL since May 15.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: Arizona looks for the three-game sweep on Sunday behind LHP Robbie Ray (7-3, 2.62), who is 5-0 with a 0.24 ERA in his last five starts.	Phillies: RHP Ben Lively (1-1, 3.00) will make his fourth career start for Philadelphia. Lively has pitched exactly seven innings in each of his outings, allowing 21 hits.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DETROIT --  After seeing their team trounced by the Detroit Tigers, Chris Archer and Jesus Colome pitched in to stop them.	Archer threw six strong innings and Colome got the final five outs as the Rays held off Detroit 3-2 on Saturday.	Daniel Robertson drove in Tampa Bay's first two runs, then scored the tiebreaker in the seventh inning. Detroit had won the first two games of the series, outscoring the Rays 18-7.	"That's a nice team win after a couple frustrating days," Rays manager Kevin Cash said. "We got beaten up, but we bounced back against a really good pitcher."	Archer (5-4) gave up two runs on six hits and a walk, striking out eight.	Tigers slugger Miguel Cabrera hit his second homer of the series after not hitting one since May 20.	"That's a very, very good lineup," Archer said. "Everything was working well today, but I made one mistake to Miggy, and he capitalized on it. He does that to everyone."	Mikie Mahtook led off the Detroit ninth with an infield single and took second on Jose Iglesias's bunt down the first-base line. Iglesias was initially ruled safe, but the call was overturned after a short replay review.	Ian Kinsler flied and after Mahtook stole third, Colome got Alex Avila to ground out to end it.	"This is one of those days where you just tip your cap to the opposing pitchers," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said. "It's not easy to score runs against Chris Archer and Jesus Colome."	Michael Fulmer (6-5) allowed three runs on six hits and four walks in 6 2/3 innings. He made his first start since skipping a start and receiving a cortisone shot to reduce inflammation in his pitching shoulder.	"I felt fine, but I was a little out of rhythm after eight days off," he said. "I went three days where I didn't even play catch, and I think that led to some of the walks."	The Rays took a 1-0 lead in the fifth. Colby Rasmus doubled with one out and after Fulmer walked Tim Beckham, Robertson lined an RBI single to center. Robertson took second on the throw to third, but Fulmer struck out Derek Norris and Mallex Smith grounded out.	Ian Kinsler hit a tying double in the bottom half, and Cabrera hit his seventh homer in the sixth for a 2-1 lead.	Tampa Ray rallied for two runs in the seventh. Robertson hit an RBI single off Kinsler's glove at second with two outs and Norris also singled. After Alex Wilson relieved, Smith grounded a go-ahead single.	"I had a chance to shut that inning down, and I just didn't get it done," Fulmer said. "That's the one frustrating thing about today."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: C Wilson Ramos (torn ACL) caught seven innings for Triple-A Durham on Friday and was scheduled to catch again on Saturday, his first back-to-back outings behind the plate. He will have Sunday off before being evaluated on Monday.	Tigers: DH Victor Martinez (irregular heartbeat) was released from a hospital in the morning after two nights of observation. Martinez, who was placed on the disabled list on Friday, will undergo monitoring next week while the Tigers are on the West Coast.	NO CONCERNS ABOUT FULMER	Ausmus said he was pleased by Fulmer's performance after the shoulder inflammation.	"He looked perfectly normal out there, which is just what we wanted to see," Ausmus said. "He didn't win, but he allowed three runs in 6 2/3 innings, which is a good start."	RED-HOT ROBERTSON	A night after driving in a career-best three runs, Robertson had two more. He has now reached safely in 17 straight starts, the longest stretch of his career.	"Any hit is a good hit, but I had some luck on my side that time," he said. "It looked like Kinsler had it, but it just slipped out."	UP NEXT	Rays: RHP Jake Faria (2-0, 1.42) will try to become the second pitcher in Rays history to win his first three career games as a starter. Jeremy Hellickson was the other, doing it in 2010.	Tigers: RHP Buck Farmer (2-0, 3.52) will start the series finale. After winning his first two starts this season without allowing a run, he gave up six runs in 2 1/3 innings in a no-decision against Arizona on Tuesday.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MILWAUKEE --  One home run in extra innings wasn't enough for the San Diego Padres, so they cranked out a couple more Saturday.	It's been that kind of weekend at Miller Park.	Cory Spangenberg and Chase d'Arnaud each hit solo homers in the 11th inning, lifting the Padres over the Milwaukee Brewers 7-5 in yet another slugfest.	The teams have combined for 15 home runs in the first two games of the three-game series. The Padres totaled a season-best five homers Saturday, including two by Yangervis Solarte and one by Wil Myers, while Milwaukee got a homer each from Orlando Arcia, Eric Thames and Keon Broxton. On Friday night, Thames' game-ending shot in the 10th was the seventh home run of the game.	Spangenberg hit the first pitch from reliever Oliver Drake (2-2) leading off the 11th, and two outs later, d'Arnaud followed with his first homer of the season.	"Our guys fought all day," Padres manager Andy Green said. "You look up, you get down 3-1. You battle back late. You tie the game against a very a good bullpen. You take some good swings in extra innings, too."	Solarte hit a two-run homer in the 10th, but Broxton tied it at 5 with a two-run shot off Brandon Maurer in the bottom of the inning.	The clubs also combined for 30 strikeouts, including 19 by the Brewers. Padres starter Dinelson Lamet accounted for a career-high 12 of those punchouts while allowing three runs in six innings.	"That is the best stuff I've seen," Green said of the 24-year-old right-hander.	The Brewers went down swinging 10 times against Lamet.	"He had a plus breaking ball," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. "His breaking ball was giving us a lot of problems."	Lamet struck out six of the first seven batters he faced before Arcia legged out an inside-the-park homer in the third. Arcia hit a ball that ricocheted off the right-center field wall and rolled along the warning track toward left, giving him ample time to score standing up. Thames followed with his NL-leading 20th homer.	Myers struck out for the team-leading 84th time in fourth, but tied the game at 3 with his 14th home run, a solo shot in the sixth.	Hunter Renfroe hit his 14th double, best among rookies, to drive in a run in the fourth. It was the first run scored by the Padres that didn't come courtesy of the long ball in the first two games of the series.	Solarte also had a solo homer in the second and got his first multihomer game since May 27, 2016, at Arizona.	The game was delayed in the top of the ninth when a male fan sprinted out to second base. Four security guards gang tackled and escorted him off the field.	Jose Torres (4-2) picked up the win in relief. Phil Maton pitched the 11th for his first career save.	BREWERS QUICKEST TO 100	The Brewers have hit 101 home runs in 70 games this season. It is the fastest in franchise history to reach 100. Previously, it took 72 games (1980, 1982).	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: OF Manuel Margot (strained right calf) ran the bases Saturday. "Everything was really good today," Green said. "Our expectation is he is days away from a rehab start." ... RHP Trevor Cahill (right shoulder strain) threw a side session Friday. "We are moving closer to getting him out with an affiliate," Green said.	Brewers: No timeline yet for the return of INF Jonathan Villar (lower back strain) or OF Ryan Braun (strained left calf).	UP NEXT	Padres: RHP Luis Perdomo (1-3, 5.16 ERA) makes his 12th start of the season, fifth on the road and second against the Brewers. He allowed three runs and five hits in six innings and struck out a season-high nine, but ended up with a no-decision May 15 in San Diego.	Brewers: RHP Jimmy Nelson (4-3, 3.67 ERA) makes his 14th start of the season and second against the Padres. He allowed two runs and seven hits in six innings, striking out eight in a 6-2 victory May 16 at Petco Park.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

ATLANTA --  Brandon Phillips is swinging a big bat at home in his first season with the Atlanta Braves.	Phillips drove in the winning run in the bottom of the 10th inning, Matt Adams had four RBI and the Atlanta Braves rallied from a four-run deficit to beat the Miami Marlins 8-7 on Saturday.	"For myself, my first walk-off win as a Brave, it really means a lot, playing in front of my family and friends," he said. "It just shows our grind as a team. We're never out of any game."	Johan Camargo led off the 10th with a single, advanced on a sacrifice and scored when Phillips singled up the middle off A.J. Ramos (1-3).	Nick Markakis' RBI double in the ninth sent the game into extra innings. Arodys Vizcaino (3-2), the seventh Atlanta pitcher, faced four batters in the 10th to get the win.	The Braves had lost five of seven overall and eight of 11 at home, but they overcame an uncustomary rocky start by pitcher Jaime Garcia to cool off the Marlins.	Adams hit his 10th homer in the first and had RBI doubles to make it 3-0 in the third and 7-6 in the seventh.	Phillips' last game-ending RBI was four years ago for Cincinnati. He has seven in his career.	Phillips has returned to his hometown with a flourish. The longtime resident of Stone Mountain doubled to begin the ninth and scored on Markakis' double. He's hitting .325 with 11 RBI in 117 at-bats at SunTrust Park.	"After this, I'm going to do some push-ups because I thought that ball was gone," Phillips said. "But I'll take the double, and I ended up scoring, so it feels good."	Tyler Moore homered and Christian Yelich doubled in a five-run fifth inning for Miami, which had won three straight and 13 of 18 behind a surging offense.	"We've got to turn the page and not let this snowball," second baseman Dee Gordon said. "We've been playing good baseball. We have to have a (short) memory. This was just a little punch in the chest."	Ramos gave up four hits and two runs in 1 1/3 innings to blow his first save since last Aug. 29. He had converted 17 straight chances.	"The slider was obviously up (against Markakis) and the two-seamer in the 10th was down the middle," Ramos said. "I have a feeling he knew it was coming and I don't care, because if I execute the pitch he doesn't do anything with it."	Jaime Garcia retired eight of the first nine batters he faced and was staked to a 3-0 lead before he unraveled in the fifth.	Moore tagged him for a two-run homer. A balk and a passed ball advanced a runner. Suzuki tied it with a single, and Yelich, who has five RBI in the last two games, added a two-run double.	Garcia had a 1.49 ERA in his previous five starts, but he gave up seven hits, two walks and a season high six runs to go with seven strikeouts in 5 2/3 innings.	Marlins starter Jeff Locke gave up three runs, five hits, one walk and struck out five in four innings.	The Braves began the day having scored just nine runs in its previous six home games and kept the trend alive with Danny Santana, Ender Inciarte and Dansby Swanson combining to strand four runners at third with two out.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: 1B Justin Bour homered in his return from the disabled list Friday and plans to return to the lineup Sunday. Moore got another start and has three homers and nine RBI over his last eight games.	Braves: LF Matt Kemp, who lined out as a pinch-hitter in the sixth, hopes to return after missing two straight starts with a sore left hamstring Sunday. He said the injury minor compared to a strained right hamstring that landed him on the 10-day disabled list in April.	SKY BLUE	With Father's Day this weekend, both teams wore powder blue caps and uniforms trimmed in the same color to recognize baseball's prostate cancer prevention program.	UP NEXT	Marlins: RHP Jose Urena (5-2) won two of his last three starts but posted a 5.08 during that span.	Braves: RHP Mike Foltynewicz (4-5) allowed three homers and eight runs in 3 1/3 innings of his last start, a no-decision at Washington.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

CINCINNATI -- Pete Rose's powerhouse Cincinnati teams had a great rivalry with the Dodgers. Lately, it's all one-sided.	Yasiel Puig hit two of the Dodgers' four homers, powering Los Angeles to a 10-2 victory on Saturday that took the edge off the Reds' latest honor for their banned hits king.	Rose unveiled a bronze sculpture of his headfirst slide in front of Great American Ball Park before the game. Thousands of packed-in fans cheered when he said, "Let's get those Reds in high gear."	Instead, the Dodgers flexed their muscle and added to their domination of Cincinnati, beating the Reds for the seventh straight time. They are 16-3 against Cincinnati since 2015, one of the most lopsided streaks in the NL over that span.	"The offense today was the star -- team offense," manager Dave Roberts said. "It's an offense that's relentless and pretty constant at putting pressure on you."	Cody Bellinger had three hits, including his 19th homer, and drove in three runs. He tied the major league record for homers in a player's first 49 games, matching the Yankees' Gary Sanchez from 2015-16.	"Bellinger's been hitting balls into the street," Puig said through a translator.	It was the third three-hit game of Bellinger's career, raising his average to .262. He also leads the team with 43 RBI in such a short time. Another big game came as no surprise.	"You're sort of expecting it," Robert said. "The homers, the doubles, the singles, the walks. ... When you look at the stat sheet, it's very impressive."	Joc Pederson homered for the second straight game as the Dodgers piled up seven extra-base hits.	Cincinnati has lost a season-high eight straight games overall.	Bellinger doubled home a run in the first off Asher Wojciechowski (1-1). He also homered as part of a five-run third inning off the rookie, and Pederson followed with his second solo homer in two games. Chris Taylor also doubled home two runs.	"I just got too much of the middle of the plate on three pitches," Wojciechowski said. "To feel like I felt for the first two innings and then for that to happen is frustrating."	Billy Hamilton scored in the first inning on a headfirst slide -- appropriate for the occasion -- but the Reds couldn't take advantage of other opportunities against Hyun-Jin Ryu (3-6), who gave up two runs in five innings. Overall, the Reds stranded four runners at third base and had two thrown out at the plate.	Y'ER GONE	Reds manager Bryan Price got his first ejection of the season from plate umpire Stu Scheurwater, who called a third strike on Hamilton in the second inning. Price was unhappy over a slight delay in the call.	"You want the call immediately," Price said. "The hesitation got under my skin."	STATS	It was Puig's third career multi-homer game. He also had one April 6 against San Diego. ... Corey Seager had a single, a double and three walks. He has five multi-hit games in his last seven. ... The Dodgers have won eight of nine overall. ... Cincinnati's Zack Cozart snapped an 0-for-19 slump with a double. ... During the Reds' losing streak, their starters are 0-5 with a 7.71 ERA. ... Joey Votto extended his hitting streak to a season-high 11 games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: 3B Justin Turner got a day off. He's hit safely in his last 12 games. He spent time on the DL last month with a strained hamstring.	Reds: LHP Brandon Finnegan went four innings in his last rehab start. The Reds hope to increase that by another inning in his next start. He's been sidelined since April 16 with a sore left shoulder.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: Kenta Maeda (4-3) made his first career relief appearance against the Reds on June 9, allowing a run in four innings for his first save in a 7-2 victory.	Reds: Bronson Arroyo (3-5) gave up a season-high 13 hits in 4 2/3 innings of a 9-3 loss at San Diego on Monday. He's 6-5 career against the Dodgers.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

NEW YORK --  The way things look right now, Stephen Strasburg and the Washington Nationals are simply too much for the New York Mets to handle.	Trea Turner hit a leadoff homer and the Nationals backed Strasburg with three long balls Saturday, beating the Mets 7-4 to stay undefeated at Citi Field this season.	Adam Lind added a two-run shot and Jose Lobaton also went deep for the NL East leaders, who can finish a four-game sweep Sunday afternoon. Washington is 6-0 in Queens this year -- part of an impressive 24-12 mark on the road -- and has won 12 of 16 at the Mets' home ballpark since the start of last season.	"I think it just shows the makeup of this team that we're very capable of winning on any given day, even when we're not firing on all cylinders," Strasburg said.	Yoenis Cespedes homered and had four hits for third-place New York, which dropped 11 1/2 games out of first.	The banged-up Mets (30-37) expected to challenge Washington at the top of the division, but injuries and poor pitching have taken their toll in a race that already looks lopsided. Miami sits in second place, 11 games behind.	"We've got 90 left. We're going to show up all 90 of them and we'll keep playing," Mets manager Terry Collins said. "You can't tuck your tail between your legs and run and hide.	"We've got veteran leadership in there that won't let down," he added.	The top pick in the 2009 amateur draft, Strasburg squared off with a 34th-round selection in New York starter Seth Lugo.	Working exclusively out of the stretch, as he has since spring training, Strasburg (8-2) rebounded from his worst start of the season. He permitted two runs and six singles -- all by Cespedes and Jay Bruce -- in 5 1/3 innings. The talented right-hander struck out five and walked two.	"Kind of scuffling out there today. Just kept trying to make pitches. Sometimes they would show up, sometimes they wouldn't," Strasburg said. "But you're going to have games like this. So you've just got to do your best to keep it close, and the offense and the bullpen picked me up today."	Four relievers from a much-maligned `pen closed it out, with Enny Romero getting five outs for his second save. The left-hander gave a huge fist pump after Cespedes grounded into a game-ending double play .	"Our bullpen did a great job," manager Dusty Baker said. "Enny, he threw lights out."	Daniel Murphy and Anthony Rendon each had an RBI double for the Nationals, who have won seven of nine meetings with the Mets this season. Washington hit three homers for the second straight game and turned four double plays -- one day after spinning three behind ace Max Scherzer.	The Nationals scored once in each of the first four innings against Lugo (1-1), including on a two-out throwing error by third baseman Wilmer Flores.	Turner's fifth career leadoff homer and third this season, on Lugo's second pitch, was the third the Mets have allowed in their past five games.	"We're having trouble keeping the ball in the ballpark," Collins said.	New York cut it to 6-4 in the eighth on an RBI single by Jose Reyes. With two on, Romero struck out Rene Rivera to end the inning -- Rivera fanned all four times up.	Turner scored from first on Rendon's double in the ninth.	RIGHT AT HOME	Washington won 12 consecutive road games against the Mets from 2013-14 and is 54-28 at Citi Field since the ballpark opened in 2009. ... Both of Lobaton's home runs this season have come at Citi Field. ... Strasburg is 6-1 on the road this year. He improved to 7-1 in nine career starts at Citi Field.	MIXED RESULTS	Lugo gave up four runs, three earned, over 6 2/3 innings in his second start this season after recovering from elbow inflammation. He was diagnosed with a partially torn ligament late in spring training. The right-hander had won six straight decisions, and the Mets had won his previous eight starts dating to Aug. 25, 2016. "I felt like a couple pitches just got away from me," Lugo said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: RHP Shawn Kelley received treatment for tightness in his neck before the game, Baker said. Kelley did not pitch.	Mets: Cespedes, who returned from a strained hamstring June 10, started his third straight game ahead of a scheduled rest Sunday. The slugger has also dealt with quadriceps and heel issues recently, and his legs were tested several times Saturday following hours of heavy rain in the early afternoon before the game. But he ran well all day, legging out two infield singles, twice going first to third and even galloping a long way for a running catch in deep left field. He hustled into second base on one of Bruce's three singles and later scored one of his three runs with a feet-first slide on Flores' line-drive sacrifice fly, barely beating a strong throw from right fielder Bryce Harper.	UP NEXT	Nationals: RHP Joe Ross (3-2, 6.39 ERA) pitches the series finale. Washington has scored 85 runs in Ross' eight starts this season.	Mets: RHP Jacob deGrom (5-3, 4.33 ERA) threw 116 pitches Monday in his second career complete game, beating the Chicago Cubs 6-1 with a five-hitter. He is 3-3 with a 3.40 ERA in nine starts vs. the Nationals and has 22 strikeouts in 12 2/3 innings against them this year.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  The Texas Rangers' biggest scoring surge of the season has the two-time AL West champions back over .500 for the first time since May 24.	Mike Napoli hit two home runs, connecting along with Rougned Odor and Shin-Soo Choo in the sixth inning to power the Rangers past the Seattle Mariners 10-4 on Saturday.	Following Friday night's 10-4 win in the series opener, the Rangers have their first back-to-back double-digit scoring games of the season.	Napoli's two-run drive capped a five-run first that sent the Rangers (34-33) to their seventh win in eight games, and they added five in the sixth. Seattle lost its third in a row.	"To tack on runs was huge for us today up and down the lineup," Texas manager Jeff Banister said.	Martin Perez (3-6) won for the first time since May 18. He left with a 5-4 lead with one out in the sixth after giving up a 463-foot, three-run homer to straightaway center by Mike Zunino.	Yovani Gallardo (3-7) retired the first two batters in the opening inning before giving up five straight hits. He lamented how big innings have hurt him all season.	"I've got to find a way to put guys away," Gallardo said. "It's frustrating. I made some pretty good pitches."	Odor hit a leadoff homer in the sixth off Dan Altavilla. Napoli and Choo later tagged the reliever for two-run drives.	"He got some balls up, and you can't do that with this club," Mariners manager Scott Servais said of Altavilla, who had not pitched since Sunday.	The returns of Napoli and Carlos Gomez from the disabled list on Friday have provided Banister with a full complement of offensive weapons. On Friday night, Gomez homered and had a season-high four RBI.	"To be able to insert Gomez and `Nap' and have them come back and have them do what they did is crucial for us going forward," Banister said.	Perez allowed seven hits, struck out five and walked two. With a 34-pitch third inning, he has had an inning of at least 25 pitches in four straight games.	"I just need to stay on the attack and don't give a chance to the (other) team to score," Perez said. "I just missed one pitch, and they scored four runs. But we won."	ZUNINO KEEPS STREAKING	Zunino's three RBI gave him 22 in June, a team record for catchers in a month. Dan Wilson held the club record with 21 in April 1996. Zunino is hitting .325 with seven homers since being recalled from Triple-A Tacoma on May 22.	"`Z' is a on a great run," Servais said. "He continues to make good adjustments in games. He's really trusting himself."	CLIMBING THE LADDER	Adrian Beltre's single in the Texas first was career hit No. 2,957, giving him sole possession of 33rd place. He was tied with Wee Willie Keeler. Beltre, 38, is 41st in career home runs with 446.	SHORT HOPS	Seattle recalled RHP Rob Whalen from Tacoma, claimed RHP Pat Light off waivers from Pittsburgh, optioned LHP Zac Curtis to Double-A Arkansas and outrighted RHP Ryne Harper to Tacoma. Light will report to Tacoma. ... Texas designated 1B-OF Peter O'Brien, who was at Triple-A Round Rock, for assignment. ... Rangers INF Hanser Alberto, out all season with an injured right shoulder, will have surgery on Monday.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: SS Jean Segura (ankle sprain) is expected to make multiple rehab starts early next week.	Rangers: RHP Andrew Cashner (strained left oblique) was placed on the 10-day disabled list retroactive to Thursday. He allowed 10 hits and four earned runs in four innings last Wednesday in a 13-2 loss at Houston.	UP NEXT	Mariners: RHP Christian Bergman (3-4) has a 10.61 road ERA this season in four starts.	Rangers: RHP Yu Darvish (6-4) is 5-0 in seven previous career starts at home vs. the Mariners.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

MINNEAPOLIS -- The Cleveland Indians have had the Twins right where they wanted them for this pivotal midseason series.	In Minnesota, actually.	Lonnie Chisenhall hit two home runs in the second game after Jose Ramirez went deep twice in the opener, and the Indians took over first place in the AL Central by sweeping a doubleheader from the Twins with 9-3 and 6-2 victories on Saturday.	"It was fun. It's a long day, but I thought our guys carried the enthusiasm throughout," Indians manager Terry Francona said.	The Indians have won seven straight games in Minnesota and are 7-2 this season overall against the Twins, whose 38-day stretch in first place ended in anticlimactic fashion. They're 14-23 this year at Target Field, the worst home record in the major leagues.	"We knew what we needed to do when we came in here," Chisenhall said. "They were in first place, and we had to beat them."	Soundly, so far. The Indians have outscored the Twins 23-6 over the first three games of the series.	"These guys are swinging well," Twins manager Paul Molitor said. "They're probably playing with house money tomorrow a little bit, so I'm sure they'll be loose."	Austin Jackson hit a solo shot in the nightcap against Twins starter Adalberto Mejia (1-3) in the fourth inning, before Chisenhall homered to put the Indians in front. Following a 75-minute rain delay , Chisenhall crushed a three-run drive against Tyler Duffey for a 5-1 lead in the fifth inning and his 10th home run of the season in just 118 at-bats.	Francisco Lindor went deep in the eighth, too, giving the Indians six home runs for the day against a depleted Twins pitching staff that sent out rookies into starting roles for the first three games. The split-admission doubleheader, created by a rainout here on April 19, didn't help a bullpen with the worst ERA in the major leagues, either.	"When we made mistakes today, they hit them over the fence. They made mistakes, and we hit them to the track for the most part," Molitor said.	Ehire Adrianza drove in two runs in the opener for the Twins, and Joe Mauer hit an RBI double before Brian Dozier homered in the nightcap. That was about it for the offense on this weak weekend.	"I hate to, but sometimes you've got to tip your cap to the other team," Dozier said. "They beat us in every facet of both games."	RED-HOT RAMIREZ	Ramirez has two or more hits in five straight games. He's 8 for 13 with two doubles, two homers, four runs and four RBI in the series.	"He's kind of playing with a vengeance, you can tell," Francona said.	WHO'LL STOP THE RAIN?	This was the third delayed game this season at Target Field, which has had three postponements. The Twins played their third doubleheader here, with two more scheduled for the road. They'll play on Sunday for the 33rd time in 34 days.	"You don't make excuses by any means," Dozier said, "but this is a long stretch."	DECISIONS, DECISIONS	The rain stopped Mike Clevinger's start in the second game after four innings, so reliever Nick Goody (1-1) was credited instead with the win, the first of his career after 56 appearances.	Zach McAllister (1-0) pitched two hitless innings in the first game for the victory. He worked in relief of starter Ryan Merritt, who made his season debut with four innings, seven hits and three runs allowed before being sent back to Triple-A.	WILK WILTS	Ramirez ignited a three-run first inning in the opener with a two-out homer off Twins starter Adam Wilk (0-2), who was recalled from Triple-A for the game and designated for assignment right after. Wilk surrendered six runs, eight hits and three walks in 3 1/3 innings.	BUSENITZ BUZZING	The Twins promoted right-handed reliever Alan Busenitz from Triple-A Rochester for the second game, and he made his major league debut with two innings, one run allowed and a fastball that frequently reached the mid-90s. The 26-year-old was acquired last season in a trade with the Los Angeles Angels.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians 2B Jason Kipnis had two doubles and a single with a run scored in the opener despite a sore neck. He rested during the nightcap.	UP NEXT	Indians: RHP Trevor Bauer (5-5, 5.85 ERA) makes his team-leading 14th start on Sunday. He's beaten the Twins twice this season.	Twins: RHP Kyle Gibson (4-4, 6.79 ERA) takes the mound in the series finale. He's 4-0 in five starts, albeit with a 5.46 ERA, since being recalled from Triple-A.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Everyone could see the potential. Alex Meyer could fire a fastball in the mid-90s, drop a curve to buckle knees. The Washington Nationals took him as the 23rd player in 2011 draft and everyone waited.	If success did not come quickly, there was no denying he looked like a pitcher ready to deliver in the Los Angeles Angels' 9-0 victory over Kansas City on Saturday that snapped the Royals' six-game winning streak.	"This is one of those games you hope for, where he bottles the stuff with command," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "He was in the zone with terrific stuff all afternoon."	Bolstered by home runs from Cameron Maybin, Albert Pujols and Luis Valbuena, Meyer (3-3) threw six scoreless innings to do his part in a two-hit shutout.	"We'd heard he was erratic with his command," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "But he threw the ball very well.	"You don't see a lot of breaking balls like that. Those 5 o'clock shadows didn't help, but they were the same for both teams."	Meyer tied a career-high with nine strikeouts, walking one. He gave up the two hits, both singles.	It was the 6-foot-9 Meyer's ninth start of the season, after beginning the year in the minors.	"The more you go out there, the more confident you get," Meyer said. "I definitely feel it's another step in the right direction."	Maybin hit a leadoff homer in the first inning, Pujols had a two-run shot in the fifth and Valbuena added a three-run homer in the seventh.	Rookie right-hander Jake Junis (2-1) got the first loss of his career, surrendering five runs and eight hits in 5 1/3 innings. He did not walk a batter and struck out six.	"He just struggled with his command," Yost said. "He left a lot of pitches over the plate."	The Royals had at least 10 hits in each of their last four games, but Meyer and relievers Blake Parker, Cam Bedrosian and Yusmeiro Petit combined for the Angels' fourth shutout of the season.	MOVING UP	Pujols' 602nd career homer gave him 1,865 career RBI, moving past Mel Ott into 10th place on baseball's career list. It was Pujols' 11th home run of the season.	ANGELIC BULLPEN	With Bedrosian back and the anticipated return of Huston Street on Tuesday, the Angels' bullpen is approaching good health. A myriad of relievers have performed in their place. The bullpen is fourth in the majors in wins (14), seventh in strikeouts and eighth in ERA (3.62).	"These guys have really been holding up well," Scioscia said.	KANSAS CITY SHUTOUT	This was hardly the first time the Royals have been blanked this season. It was the seventh time they have been shut out, tying the San Francisco Giants for the most in baseball.	MAYBIN LEADING OFF	The Angels outfielder has hit in eight consecutive games. Since being moved to the leadoff spot, he is batting .388 (31 for 80) with three home runs.	"It's always good to get a quick lead like that," Maybin said. "It allows your pitcher to breathe a little bit."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: RHP Matt Shoemaker (forearm tightness) was placed on the 10-day DL, though no starter has been named for his next turn in the rotation Tuesday. ... RHP Parker Bridwell was recalled from Triple-A Salt Lake to take his roster spot. ... Bedrosian (groin) was also activated from the DL and RHP Daniel Wright returned to Salt Lake. Bedrosian last pitched April 21. ... OF Mike Trout (thumb surgery) is expected to start holding a bat next week.	UP NEXT	Royals: LHP Jason Vargas (9-3) will take the majors' second-lowest ERA (2.10) into Sunday's series finale against the Angels. He has held opponents to two or fewer runs in 10 of his 13 previous starts.	Angels: RHP JC Ramirez (6-4) is scheduled to make his 13th start of the season. Ramirez, a career reliever until four games into this season, threw a career-high 111 pitches in his last outing.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

HOUSTON --  Jose Altuve and Carlos Beltran gave the Houston Astros a jolt on Saturday night.	For the Boston Red Sox, Rick Porcello's performance has been pretty shocking, too.	Altuve hit a solo homer, Beltran had a two-run shot and three RBI, and the Astros beat the Red Sox 7-1.	Altuve led off the third with his homer off the train tracks above the left-center field facade, and Beltran followed three batters later with his ninth of the season to put Houston ahead 6-0.	"We swung the bat very well," Houston manager A.J. Hinch said. "Both innings where we had the three-run innings, we put a lot of at-bats together."	Houston jumped on last year's AL Cy Young Award winner Porcello (3-9) for three runs in the first. Altuve had an RBI double, and Brian McCann and Beltran followed with sacrifice flies.	"He's a guy that has a good sinker," Beltran said of Porcello. "Facing him last year, the year he won the Cy Young, his sinker was amazing. It's not that it's not amazing. It's just that location is what makes his sinker his sinker. Today, we got good pitches in the middle of the plate."	Porcello gave up seven runs and 10 hits in six innings.	"I don't think it's the fastballs up, it's everything," Porcello said. "Guys are very comfortable with everything they are seeing and driving the ball off me right now. I got to make it back to making them uncomfortable."	Porcello lost his fourth straight -- his second four-game losing streak this season -- and has allowed five or more runs in three straight outings.	"The difference once again is elevation in the strike zone," Boston manager John Farrell said. "It wasn't pitched tight. Anytime he made a mistake up in the strike zone whether it was a breaking ball to Altuve to a fastball that didn't stay in or down to Beltran, those are pitches that seemingly come back to haunt him."	Yuli Gurriel scored on Norichika Aoki's double play in the sixth to give the Astros a 7-1 lead.	David Paulino (1-0) allowed one run and three hits with four strikeouts in six innings for his first career win. Houston has allowed two runs or less in each of the last three games.	"That was a great performance," Hinch said. "And I loved his demeanor; he was calm the whole day. He was focused, he was getting them to mishit some balls. He stayed very calm in his approach."	Paulino said through a translator locating his fastball and curveball was the key to the win.	"My curveball was the best pitch even when I wasn't throwing it for strikes, I think that was working today," Paulino said.	Chris Young led off the fifth with a solo home run for Boston.	MILESTONES	Altuve's home run was his tenth this season, marking his third consecutive double-digit home run season. He joins Craig Biggio as the only second basemen in Astros' history to record at least three double-digit home run seasons. ... Beltran's home run was the 430th of his career, placing him one shy of Cal Ripken Jr. for the 48th most in MLB history.	TRAINING ROOM	Red Sox: 1B Hanley Ramirez was out of the lineup for a second straight day with a spasm in his neck. ... RHP Tyler Thornburg had successful surgery to treat thoracic outlet syndrome in his right shoulder Friday and is expected to return in 2018, Boston announced Saturday.	Astros: RHP Lance McCullers (lower back discomfort) played catch Saturday and could start on Houston's upcoming road trip. "There's still some things he needs to do in order to satisfy everyone that he's ready to start, but certainly the initial goal would for him to start on the road trip," Hinch said. ... RHP Charlie Morton (right lat strain) will go with the team on the upcoming road trip and could go on a rehab assignment.	UP NEXT	Red Sox: LHP David Price (1-1) will try to build on his last outing when he allowed three runs in six innings when he starts the finale of the three-game series Sunday night.	Astros: RHP Joe Musgrove (4-5) will start for the 12th time this season and second since coming off the DL on Monday when he starts Sunday. Musgrove will be looking to even his record after taking the loss in his last start, allowing two runs in 4 2/3 innings against Texas.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

PITTSBURGH --  The way Chicago Cubs manager Joe Maddon figures it, the list of relievers with better stuff than Pittsburgh's Felipe Rivero is short. Really short. There might be five.	After spending two nights watching Rivero have his way with Chicago's lineup, the list might be getting even shorter.	Barely 24 hours after working the eighth to preserve a Pittsburgh lead only to see it evaporate in the ninth following his exit, Rivero got the final five outs for his third save as the Pirates held on for a 4-3 win on Saturday night.	"He just goes out there, he's doing his job pitching," Pittsburgh center fielder Andrew McCutchen said. "Slow heartbeat -- no heartbeat at all, actually."	Rivero entered with one out in the eighth and the tying run on second then walked Kris Bryant before retiring Albert Almora Jr. and getting a fabulous play by second baseman Max Moroff to end the threat. Rivero worked a perfect ninth to give the Pirates a boost following their meltdown the night before.	"To get five outs, it's a big save," Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said. "It's a good save for us, a bounce back game after (Friday) night."	Gregory Polanco broke out of a 3 for 31 slump with a two-run homer and McCutchen hit his 12th home run of the season. Ivan Nova (7-4) pitched seven strong innings, cutting loose after striking out pinch-hitter Jon Jay to end the seventh. His 94th and final pitch was also his fastest, a 97 mph fastball that Jay couldn't get a bat on.	"I said it was smart pitching," said Nova, who has worked at least six innings in all 13 of his starts this season. "I don't need to be throwing 97, 98 from the first pitch. My job is to locate my pitches and pitch 92 or 93. If I need to go harder, I feel good enough to throw."	Jake Arrieta (6-5) hit the fifth home run of his career but struggled with his command late and is now 0-3 with a 7.80 ERA in his last five starts against Pittsburgh. He went 9-1 with a 1.46 ERA the first 13 ties he faced the Pirates. The 2015 NL Cy Young Award winner was removed with two outs in the fifth inning following a sequence in which he uncorked two wild pitches and hit a batter. He blamed the wildness on sweating and not the laceration on his right (pitching) thumb.	"It's a helpless feeling when you can't put pressure on a ball and execute a pitch," he said. "It happens. You hope that you can just find a way to get through the inning a make an adjustment. I really wasn't able to."	Addison Russell hit his sixth home run of the season for the Cubs. Anthony Rizzo led off the game with a single and went 2 for 4 to extend his hitting streak to 11 games, but the defending World Series champions dipped back below .500 (33-34).	The Cubs have been unable to get anything going as their hangover from the franchise's first title in 108 years lingers. It looked like they found something Friday night, when they erupted for six runs in the ninth to rally for a win. The surge came against Juan Nicasio and Tony Watson, who came in when Rivero needed 20 pitches to get out of the eighth against the top of Chicago's lineup.	Nicasio was unavailable on Saturday, and when Daniel Hudson gave up a double to rookie Ian Happ with one out in the eighth, Rivero came in and did it again. Before the game, Maddon raved about Rivero's command and his comportment. Both were on full display as Maddon watched from the dugout and Nova watched from the trainer's room.	"It's amazing that guy that we have here," Nova said. "You can ask him for one inning, he'll throw one inning. You ask him for two innings, he'll go two innings. It looks so easy."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: Gave 2B Josh Harrison the day off for just the third time this season. Hurdle pointed to a draining stretch for Harrison -- who leads the team with a .302 batting average -- and a lackluster history against Arrieta (.077 average) as the major factors in the decision.	UP NEXT:	Cubs: Struggling veteran John Lackey (4-7, 5.26 ERA) will look for his first win in a month on Sunday in the series finale. Lackey is 0-4 with a 6.75 ERA in his last five starts.	Pirates: Jameson Taillon (3-1, 2.90) will try to win his second straight start since returning from a cancer scare. Taillon pitched five scoreless innings on Monday just five weeks removed from a procedure to deal with testicular cancer.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

TORONTO -- Though Russell Martin isn't among the home run leaders, he certainly makes them count.	The veteran catcher hit a game-tying homer in the sixth inning to help rally the Toronto Blue Jays to a 7-3 victory over the Chicago White Sox on Sunday.	Of Martin's seven home runs, five have either tied the game or given Toronto the lead.	"Timing is everything," he said of his two-run drive that bounced off the top of the center-field fence and chased Chicago starter James Shields from the game.	Ryan Goins' first triple of the season two batters later drove in the winning run.	The win snapped Chicago's three-game winning streak and prevented the White Sox from tying a club record with a seventh consecutive win at Rogers Centre. The White Sox have won nine of the last 11 games and the last four series against the Blue Jays.	Kendrys Morales added a monster home run in the bat-around seventh, a moon shot into the fourth deck of Rogers Centre to give the Blue Jays their 27th multi-home run game of the season. Toronto is 19-8 in those games.	"That's kind of our DNA," Martin said. "We love the long ball. Kind of built that way."	J.A. Happ (2-4) picked up his first home win of the season. In his second-longest start, the left-hander giving up eight hits over 6 2/3 innings while striking out nine. Roberto Osuna worked the ninth.	"The White Sox were playing a great series, played really good defense," Happ said. "I was just trusting we would do the same and grind back in that ball game and the huge sixth inning there was awesome, Russ with the big hit and we kept going."	In his first start since April 16, Shields lasted 5 2/3 innings, giving up seven hits and three runs, including the two-run shot from Martin that ended his afternoon. Anthony Swarzak (3-2) took the loss.	Shields tipped his cap to Martin on the tying homer.	"I left it up a little bit but it was off the plate a little bit too and he put a good swing on it and unfortunately it hit the top the wall," he said.	Melky Cabrera singled and doubled for his seventh multi-hit effort in the last 11 games, while Jose Abreu drove in two runs to extend his hit streak to seven games, marking the fifth consecutive game he has registered at least one RBI.	Despite the loss, manager Rick Renteria was optimistic after witnessing his club post consecutive series victories.	"I know we're swinging the bats a little better," he said. "It's like anything, you get into little grooves and obviously we've been in the groove the last six or seven days."	BAD DAY AT THE OFFICE	Coming into Sunday as the American League batting leader with a .337 average, Avisail Garcia had just his second three-strikeout game of the season, going 0 for 4 in the loss.	GROUND(HOG) RULE DOUBLE	For the second straight day, the Blue Jays were denied a run due to a ground-rule double. On Saturday, Tulowitzki was held at third on a Goins ground-rule double, only to see the inning end one batter later. On Sunday, it was the turn of Josh Donaldson, who was also held at third in the first inning when Morales drove a double down the left-field line, but was stranded when Justin Smoak grounded out to end the inning.	HIGHLIGHT REEL	Leading off the seventh, Donaldson fired a come-backer right back over the mound. Already leading to his left in his follow-through, right-hander Swarzak threw his glove behind his back to knock the ball down, then calmly picked the ball up and threw to first to get the out.	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox: Prior to Sunday's game, Chicago placed RHP Miguel Gonzalez on the 10-day DL, retroactive to June 15, with inflammation in his right shoulder. Gonzalez was 4-8 with a 5.49 ERA over 13 starts. The White Sox also reinstated Shields from the DL after three rehab starts with Triple-A Charlotte. ... LHP Carlos Rodon, out all season with left biceps bursitis, successfully came through his third rehab starts at Charlotte on Saturday. Manager Rick Renteria wants him to have one more start in the minors before making any moves.	Blue Jays: Toronto announced the trade of RHP Jarrett Grube from Triple-A Buffalo to the Columbus Clippers for cash considerations. The 35-year-old was 2-3 with a 6.95 ERA in 11 starts this season, all in Triple-A.	UP NEXT	White Sox: After a day off, Chicago will open a three-game series in Minnesota on Tuesday with a matchup between LHP Derek Holland (5-6, 3.79) and RHP Ervin Santana (8-4, 2.56).	Blue Jays: Toronto visits Texas for a four-game series beginning Monday, when RHP Marco Estrada (4-5, 4.54) goes up against RHP Austin Bibens-Dirkx (2-0, 3.28).	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

DETROIT --  Steven Souza Jr. has been looking forward to playing on Father's Day since his son Micah was born in December.	The day ended up more memorable than he could have imagined.	Souza hit his first career grand slam as the Tampa Bay Rays beat the Detroit Tigers 9-1 on Sunday. He also homered this season on Mother's Day.	"It was special to hit one for my mom on Mother's Day, but today was for both my dad and for my son," he said. "When I got back to the dugout, I looked into the camera, thanked my dad, told Micah that I love him and thanked my wife for making all of this possible.	"I can't wait to get home tonight and see them."	Logan Morrison had two of Tampa Bay's five homers, while Derek Norris and Evan Longoria each had one. The Rays won the last two games of the four-game series after being outscored 18-7 in the first two.	"It's huge to come back and split a series against a team like, especially after playing two ugly games to start," Souza said.	The Tigers went 2-4 on their six-game homestand and have lost seven of their last 10. Detroit is now 32-36 and in fourth place, 4 1/2 games behind Cleveland in the AL Central.	"It was a crappy homestand, quite frankly," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said. "We're not going to make any strides if we keep playing like this."	Jake Faria (3-0) allowed one run, six hits and a walk in seven innings. He struck out a career-high nine. Faria is the second starting pitcher in Rays history to win his first three career games, joining Jeremy Hellickson.	"My secret is not shaking off Derek," Faria said. "He knows these hitters a lot better than I do, so I'm letting him make the decisions."	Buck Farmer (2-1) allowed seven runs in 2 1/3 innings, and has now allowed 13 runs in 4 2/3 innings over his last two starts. Farmer gave up five hits, including three homers, walked one batter and hit another.	"I have to execute pitches, and in the last two games, I haven't done that," he said.	Farmer was demoted to Triple-A Toledo after the game.	"It's always difficult being sent down, but it is probably for the best."	Morrison gave the Rays a 2-0 lead in the first with his 20th homer of the season, a drive off the railing above the right-field fence.	Justin Upton's RBI single made it 2-1 in the bottom of the first, but Norris restored the two-run lead with a homer in the third.	Later in the inning, the Rays loaded the bases with a single, a hit batter and a walk before Souza made it 7-1 with his first grand slam.	Longoria and Morrison gave the Rays an eight-run lead with back-to-back homers off Chad Bell in the seventh. It was Tampa's ninth set of back-to-back homers this season, tying a franchise record set in 2007 and tied in 2008.	The first pitch was delayed 31 minutes by rain.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: C Wilson Ramos (ACL tear) caught six innings for Triple-A Durham on Saturday, marking the first time he had caught on back-to-back days in his rehab process. He had a scheduled day off on Sunday.	Tigers: DH Victor Martinez (irregular heartbeat) is expected to stay away from any activity while the Tigers are on a seven-game road trip. Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said if his heart rate remains normal, Martinez could resume light cardio activity in about a week.	MORRISON'S MEMORABLE DAY	Morrison has dedicated much of his career to his father, who died of lung cancer during his rookie season. He runs a charity baseball camp in his dad's honor and pays tribute to his military service with a Coast Guard salute after each home run.	"I'm sure having a game like this on Father's Day was special for LoMo, because we all know how close he was to his dad," Rays manager Kevin Cash said.	SHORT-LIVED EXPERIMENT	Tigers manager Brad Ausmus announced before the game that Anibal Sanchez will return from Triple-A Toledo and start Monday's game in Seattle, with the Tigers moving temporarily to a six-man rotation. Sanchez posted a 9.00 ERA in 11 games as a long reliever before voluntarily going to Toledo to work on transitioning back to a starting role. In four starts with the Mud Hens, he went 0-2 with a 4.60 ERA.	However, with Farmer being sent down to make room for Sanchez, the Tigers are back at five starters.	UP NEXT	Rays: Tampa opens a six-game, seven-day homestand Monday, with RHP Jake Odorizzi (4-3, 3.77) facing Cincinnati's Scott Feldman (5-5, 4.29).	Tigers: Detroit heads to the west coast for seven games in seven days against Seattle and San Diego. Sanchez (0-0, 9.00) will start the opener against the Mariners against Sam Gaviglio (3-1, 3.41).	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

CINCINNATI --  The shortest outing of Bronson Arroyo's season might be the last of his career.	The 40-year-old right-hander was roughed up for five runs and seven hits in just three innings on Sunday as the Los Angeles Dodgers built a seven-run lead before holding on for an 8-7 win over the Cincinnati Reds, who have lost nine straight.	Arroyo (3-6), attempting a comeback this season with his former team after missing 2 1/2 seasons with arm and shoulder problems, including Tommy John surgery and a procedure on his shoulder, revealed after the game that he'd been receiving cortisone shots in his shoulder since spring training.	"We tried to patch it up and it worked for a while, but I've been hit around the yard for a while now," Arroyo said. "Have I thought `This time might be my last time on the field?' Yeah."	Arroyo, who gave up for nine runs and a career-high 13 hits in his last start at San Diego, planned to meet with manager Bryan Price either late on Sunday or sometime on Monday.	"It's not just a challenge with his stuff," Price said. "It's a physical challenge."	Logan Forsythe and Justin Turner homered, Kenta Maeda pitched five strong innings and drove in two runs and Kike Hernandez made a spectacular game-saving catch to lift the surging Dodgers to their ninth win in their last 10 games.	"It got a little close for us," Los Angeles manager Dave Roberts said. "Our bullpen has been lights out all year. They put some good at-bats against us. Like I've said, that's a very good offensive club. To get out of here with three (wins) is huge."	Cincinnati nearly rallied all the way back from an 8-1 deficit in the sixth inning. However, Hernandez went back to the left-field wall and made an awkward leaping grab of Joey Votto's attempt at a go-ahead extra-base hit with runners on first and third in the eighth.	Maeda (5-3), in his first appearance since June 9 and first start since June 4, allowed just three hits and one run in five innings to help the Dodgers complete a three-game sweep.	"The team wanted me to be aggressive and pound the zone and that's what happened," Maeda said through an interpreter. "It took some time for me to start again, but I was able to get into a rhythm. I tried to stay aggressive and not change my plan with runners on base."	Scooter Gennett hit a three-run home run, his first since he had a major league record-tying four on June 6, and Adam Duvall and Eugenio Suarez each added solo shots for the Reds.	Kenley Jansen got the last three outs for his 15th save.	Cincinnati scored more than three runs for the first time in six games, but still extended its longest losing streak of the season. The Reds' skid, their worst since an 11-game streak in May 2016, started with a three-game sweep by the Dodgers in Los Angeles, setting up their first sweep of a season series with Cincinnati since 2006.	The Dodgers scored all of their runs with two outs, including Forsythe's two-run drive in the third inning and Turner's three-run shot in the sixth. Both of those shots reached the upper deck in left field and gave the Dodgers seven homers in the series.	HELLO, GOODBYE	Dodgers RHP Josh Ravin was recalled on Friday, pitched two innings of relief on Saturday and was optioned to Triple-A Oklahoma City on Sunday when RHP Brock Stewart was recalled from Oklahoma City.	Los Angeles also claimed OF Peter O'Brien off waivers from the Texas Rangers and designated LHP Jason Wheeler for assignment. O'Brien will be assigned to Triple-A.	STILL HOT	After getting Saturday off, Turner wasted no time extending his hitting streak to 13 games, lining a first-inning single to left field. Turner strung together a career-high 16-game streak in April.	TRACKING IT DOWN	Reds CF Billy Hamilton, a Gold Glove finalist each of the last three seasons, went a long way to the left-center field wall in the third inning to track down leadoff batter Turner's deep fly, snagging it with a backhand grab while glancing off the glass in front of the Reds bullpen.	STILL A THREAT	Hamilton went into Sunday's game leading the major leagues in stolen bases despite not swiping one in 13 games, the longest drought of his career and one he snapped with a steal of second in the fifth inning.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: LHP Clayton Kershaw (9-2) is 8-1 with a 1.49 earned-run average in 13 career starts against the Mets, who've hit a combined .177 against him.	Reds: RHP Scott Feldman (5-5) was roughed up for eight hits and four runs in five innings in his last start on Tuesday at San Diego.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK --  Toting his toddler around the clubhouse postgame, Jacob deGrom joked about the Father's Day present he gave himself -- the souvenir ball from his first big league home run.	"I think I got lucky," the New York Mets ace said.	With 1-year-old Jaxon and his own dad in the ballpark, deGrom put on quite a performance Sunday. He shut down a bruising Washington Nationals lineup on three singles for eight dominant innings and also delivered the loudest hit in a 5-1 win that prevented a four-game sweep.	Fresh off pitching the Mets' first complete game of the season in his previous start against the Cubs, deGrom turned in a complete effort, excelling with his arm, bat and glove.	"It was awesome," is how he summed it up.	The NL East-leading Nationals had been 6-0 at Citi Field this season and had battered the Mets in three games this week, never trailing while totaling 18 extra-base hits. But they had trouble touching the blue-stitched balls -- used all around Major League Baseball on Father's Day -- thrown by deGrom (6-3).	"You've got to put it on deGrom. We knew he was going to be tough going into today because they didn't want to be swept at home," Washington manager Dusty Baker said.	DeGrom mixed his fastball, slider and changeup well, fanned Bryce Harper with a 97 mph heater on his 105th and last pitch and walked off to a standing ovation. The right-hander struck out six and walked two, and the only run against him was unearned.	A career .199 hitter in 176 at-bats coming in, deGrom also provided the biggest jolt. He hit the first pitch of the third inning from Joe Ross (3-3) over the wall in left-center.	"I was running pretty hard," deGrom said. "I didn't know it was gone."	The 2014 NL Rookie of the Year, a converted infielder at Stetson University, kept holding down his helmet as he rounded the bases, making sure it didn't fly off his flyaway hair.	The ball sat in a display box, on the top shelf of his locker, by the end of the game. He said the prize was destined for his dad, Tony.	DeGrom's lone pro homer had been for Triple-A Las Vegas in 2013. He said he used injured captain David Wright's bat for this drive, having tried it once before and playfully describing the lumber as "a good bunting bat."	DeGrom later put down a sacrifice, too, setting up an RBI single by Michael Conforto.	The victory made the Mets 17-0 when their pitcher homers, dating to a loss when Jason Isringhausen connected in 1996, the Elias Sports Bureau said.	T.J. Rivera had four hits for the Mets. A popup that Nationals second baseman Daniel Murphy lost in the sun set up two New York runs in the fourth for a 3-1 lead.	Trea Turner stole four bases, setting a Nationals record. Harper extended his hitting streak to 11 games -- matching his longest in a single season -- leading to Ryan Zimmerman's sacrifice fly in the first.	DeGrom made a nifty play in the fourth, charging in to grab Murphy's tapper and throwing out his former teammate. Murphy doubled in the ninth off reliever Addison Reed and has safely reached base in all 29 games he's played against the Mets.	DAYTIME DEGROM	DeGrom is 16-4 with a 1.71 ERA in 32 career daytime starts. ... Nationals teammates Anthony Rendon and Michael A. Taylor both were hitless in three at-bats against him -- Rendon is 0 for 16 lifetime vs. deGrom and Taylor is 0 for 14.	TURNER BURNER	Turner is 26 for 31 on steal tries, putting the leadoff man three behind Cincinnati's Billy Hamilton for the major league lead. He said first base coach Davey Lopes, who swiped 557 bases in the majors, had given him a key piece of advice.	"Tell me to run. For me, it's all about confidence, he gives you the confidence to run, but that's something I've never really had," Turner said. "I've had coaches that give you the green light, but it was always on me. He's pushing me to run and that's huge for me personally."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: RHP Shawn Kelley was put on the 10-day disabled list because of a strained muscle in his upper right back. The reliever is 3-2 with four saves and a 7.00 ERA in 22 games, giving up nine homers in 18 innings. He was on the DL in May with a lower back strain. RHP A.J. Cole was recalled from Triple-A Syracuse.	Mets: Star LF Yoenis Cespedes got a planned day off after starting three straight games. He spent six weeks on the DL with a strained hamstring and returned last weekend.	UP NEXT	Nationals: RHP Tanner Roark (6-4, 4.39 ERA) opposes LHP Justin Nicolino (0-1, 4.15) to begin a three-game series at Miami.	Mets: RHP Zack Wheeler (3-4, 4.48) starts against lefty ace Clayton Kershaw (9-2, 2.23) at Dodger Stadium to begin a 10-game road trip.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

BALTIMORE --  Ubaldo Jimenez walked off the mound to a standing ovation, a rare reception for the beleaguered Baltimore Orioles' right-hander.	Jimenez was stellar in his first start since May 22, Mark Trumbo homered for the second consecutive day and the Orioles took a three-game series against the St. Louis Cardinals with a 8-5 victory Sunday.	"He knew what we needed and he delivered it," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said about Jimenez. "We basically had a day game yesterday and we're in a stretch with 20-21 games in a row. Real proud of everybody today. There was a lot of intensity there."	Baltimore homered 10 times while winning two of three from the Cardinals to improve to .500 (34-34). It was the first time the Orioles won a three-game series since May 29-31 against the Yankees.	Jimenez (2-2) has struggled most of the season and relinquished his starting role to Alec Asher, who also failed to hold down the job. Jimenez will likely stay in the rotation after allowing just two runs on four hits with three strikeouts and two walks over seven innings.	"I just want to fight," Jimenez said. "Doesn't matter where I am, I'm going to try to do the best I can. It felt good to be able to be there for the team today."	Seth Smith and Trey Mancini homered to start the first and second innings, respectively, for Baltimore. Welington Castillo also had a solo shot in the fifth that gave the Orioles a 7-2 lead.	Brad Brach picked up his 12th save for Baltimore.	Dexter Fowler homered for the fourth consecutive game with a two-run shot in the eighth, and three batters later, Yadier Molina had solo home run that pulled the Cardinals to 8-5.	Stephen Piscotty also hit a pair of solo homers for the Cardinals, who have lost five of six.	"We need to get the ball in the air and they were able to keep us from doing it on a consistent basis," Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said.	St. Louis' Lance Lynn (5-4) allowed seven runs and nine hits with five strikeouts and a career-high four home runs over 4 2/3 innings.	"It's baseball," Lynn said. "You go through times when it's going well and times when it's going better than you think."	Manny Machado's RBI single in the sixth gave Baltimore an 8-2 lead.	THREE BAGGERS	Adam Jones and Trey Mancini each hit a triple in the fifth inning. It was Jones' first triple since 2015 and the first of Mancini's career. The Orioles had not hit two triples in an inning since Aug. 14, 2009.	LONG BALL	The Orioles joined the New York Yankees as the only teams in the majors with six players that have 10 or more home runs.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: 2B Kolten Wong (right triceps strain) has been "resting and strengthening" after going on the 10-day DL on Thursday, manager Mike Matheny said. Wong is batting .304 in 45 games (125 at-bats).	Orioles: SS J.J. Hardy (right wrist contusion) left the game in the sixth after being hit by a pitch. ... Reliever Darren O'Day (right shoulder strain) will throw his first bullpen session Monday.	UP NEXT	Cardinals: RHP Mike Leake (5-6, 3.14) is looking to snap a four-game losing streak when he starts the series opener Tuesday against Phillies RHP Jeremy Hellickson (5-5, 4.91).	Orioles: RHP Dylan Bundy (7-5, 3.29) has been Baltimore's most effective starter and throws Monday against first-place Cleveland and RHP Corey Kluber (5-2, 4.15).	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ATLANTA --  Brandon Phillips thought it was "epic" to get the Braves' game-winning hit for the second straight day.	Having his dad in the stands on Father's Day added to the thrill.	Phillips punched a ninth-inning single through a stacked infield to drive in Johan Camargo from third base and give Atlanta a 5-4 win over the Miami Marlins on Sunday.	Phillips also delivered the decisive run-scoring single in the 10th that gave Atlanta an 8-7 victory over Miami on Saturday.	"Yesterday was crazy but today was one of those epic things," Phillips said. "I never thought I'd have back-to-back walk-offs."	Camargo hit a one-out infield single off Drew Steckenrider (0-1) and moved to third on Ender Inciarte's line-drive single up the middle.	The Marlins called in Marcell Ozuna from left field to serve as an extra infielder positioned near second base for Phillips' at-bat. That strategy made Phillips think about lofting a fly ball to the outfield.	"I didn't get the ball in the air like I thought I was going to do, but I'll take it," he said.	Phillips, who is from the Atlanta suburbs, was traded to the Braves from Cincinnati for two minor league pitchers in February. He is hitting .306.	"It feels good, just being here ... a dream come true," said the 35-year-old Phillips, who added that his father, James, and two of his children attended the game.	Jim Johnson (5-1) pitched a scoreless ninth.	Marlins manager Don Mattingly said he called on Steckenrider, who was recalled from Triple-A New Orleans on June 10, because more experienced relievers needed a day off.	"The bullpen gets to a point where you use a lot of guys, so he's in that situation today," Mattingly said. "Probably a tough situation for him to be in today. Still, he's got to throw strikes. He's calm out there, so it's not really a bad situation, just not so good right now."	The Braves took a 4-2 lead with four runs in the seventh. Nick Markakis slapped a tiebreaking, two-run single down the third-base line.	The Marlins pulled even on Ozuna's two-run homer off Jose Ramirez in the eighth.	Miami right-hander Jose Urena allowed two hits through six scoreless innings before he was pulled after giving up singles to Kurt Suzuki and Dansby Swanson to open the seventh. David Phelps gave up a sacrifice fly to Rio Ruiz and a pinch-hit single to Camargo that tied the game.	Justin Bour's bases-loaded, two-run single off Mike Foltynewicz in the sixth gave Miami a 2-0 lead.	Urena hit three batters with pitches. There was no retaliation from the Braves, though Foltynewicz threw an inside pitch that forced Urena, who was trying to bunt, to jump back in the third inning.	Foltynewicz allowed two runs on seven hits and two walks in six innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: LHP Justin Nicolino (bruised left index finger) will come off the DL to start against Washington on Monday night.	Braves: LF Matt Kemp made his first start since straining his left hamstring on Wednesday. He appeared as a pinch hitter on Saturday.	REMEMBER THAT, OZZIE?	Phillips became the first Atlanta player to drive in winning runs with game-ending hits on consecutive days in almost 30 years. Ozzie Virgil accomplished the feat on Sept. 18-19, 1988, against the Padres and Giants, respectively. The Braves have won 11 games in their last at-bat, most in the majors.	EARLY SHOWER	Snitker was ejected by home plate umpire Chris Segal for arguing a called third strike on Matt Adams to end the sixth. "I thought the ball was up. He didn't agree with me," Snitker said after his second ejection of the season.	UP NEXT	Marlins: Miami opens a home series against the Nationals on Monday night. Nicolino is 0-2 with a 6.55 ERA in three career games, including two starts, vs. Washington.	Braves: Atlanta's 10-game homestand continues with the first of four games against the Giants. RHP R.A. Dickey gave up seven runs, six earned, in his first start of the season against San Francisco, a 7-1 loss on May 28.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

PHILADELPHIA --  Rey Fuentes' first major league home run was a game-winner in extra innings.	Fuentes homered in the 10th inning to lift the Arizona Diamondbacks to a 5-4 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Sunday.	"It's very special," Fuentes said. "Even more today since it's Father's Day, so shout out to my father. Happy Father's Day today and that's my gift to him."	Fuentes entered the game in the eighth inning as a pinch runner and was caught stealing. However, the rookie redeemed himself by going deep off Jeanmar Gomez (3-2) with one out in the 10th.	"I was about to jump in (to the bushes) after that third out to look for it," Fuentes said of the home run ball, which was retrieved by the grounds crew. "I'm going to send it home to my dad."	The Diamondbacks completed a three-game sweep of the Phillies with their seventh straight win overall. Arizona improved to 44-26, the best 70-game start in team history.	"They were resilient," Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said. "We had a couple tough moments today and these guys didn't let that affect them. I said from the beginning, overcoming tough moments, cycling it through and then coming out the other end is something that winning teams do and we do that very well."	The Phillies have lost 11 of 12 and have baseball's worst record at 22-46.	Hector Neris entered with a 4-3 lead in the ninth and failed to pick up a save for the second time in eight chances. He walked the first batter he faced, allowed two singles to tie the game and then worked out of a jam to keep the score even.	Archie Bradley (3-1) pitched a scoreless bottom of the ninth, stranding a pair of baserunners. Fernando Rodney earned his 20th save in 23 chances.	Arizona left-hander Robbie Ray allowed four runs over 5 1/3 innings after giving up just one run over his last 37 innings while winning his last five decisions.	"I guess it was a week since my last start, and I had to space out my bullpens a little bit," Ray said. "But that's not really an excuse. This is the major leagues and you have to be ready for it."	The Diamondbacks raced out to an early 3-0 lead against Ben Lively with first-inning home runs by Paul Goldschmidt and Chris Owings. Lively scattered four hits over his last five innings.	"He did a real good job," Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said. "It's good to see the way he battles. All four of his starts have been good. He's a tough guy."	Aaron Altherr and Maikel Franco each hit solo home runs for Philadelphia. Ty Kelly put the Phillies ahead 4-3 in the sixth inning with a pinch-hit RBI double.	A STREAK AND A MILESTONE	Phillies 1B Tommy Joseph extended his career-best hitting streak to 14 games with a single in the fifth inning. He has the longest active hitting streak in the major leagues. Howie Kendrick picked up career hit No. 1,500 on a single in the third inning.	SHUFFLING THE ROTATION	Diamondbacks LHP Patrick Corbin's next start will be pushed back to Friday. Corbin will make his second consecutive start against the Phillies and will avoid a matchup with the Rockies in Colorado.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: OF A.J. Pollock (strained right groin) made first his rehab appearance on Saturday night with Triple-A Reno. He played five innings in center field as scheduled and went 1 for 2 with a walk.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: RHP Zack Greinke (8-3, 3.00) starts for Arizona on Tuesday night in Colorado RHP German Marquez (5-3, 4.19). Greinke won his lone start at Coors Field this season, allowing just two runs over seven innings.	Phillies: RHP Jeremy Hellickson (5-5, 4.91) faces Cardinals RHP Mike Leake (5-6, 3.14) on Tuesday in the beginning of a three-game set in Philadelphia. Hellickson is 1-5 with a 6.89 ERA in his last nine starts.

MILWAUKEE --  With a tired Brewers bullpen in dire need of a break, Jimmy Nelson carried the load all by himself Sunday.	Nelson struck out 10 in his first career complete game and Milwaukee got home runs from Hernan Perez and Manny Pina in a 2-1 victory over the San Diego Padres.	"This is a guy picking everybody up and giving those guys a day off," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. "That's what you need some days. That's what big-time performance does -- not only wins you the game, but gives guys rest."	Counsell said closer Corey Knebel and relievers Oliver Drake and Jared Hughes were not available because they needed a breather.	Nelson (5-3) allowed six hits and two walks while throwing 118 pitches in his 89th major league start. He gave up only an unearned run and lowered his ERA to 3.28.	"I've gone seven-plus or eight a couple of times, but that ninth inning definitely is nice," Nelson said. "Counsell showed confidence in letting us go deep."	Leading off the sixth, Perez hit his 10th home run into the Brewers' bullpen off starter Luis Perdomo (1-4). One batter later, Pina connected on a 1-2 pitch for his fourth of the season to give Milwaukee a 2-1 lead.	Perdomo gave up eight hits and two walks with four strikeouts in six innings. He was helped by three double plays in the first five innings.	"He was in trouble in the first, the second, the third, the fifth," Padres manager Andy Green said. "He navigated a lot of trouble today. Some good defense behind him."	Perdomo has lasted at least six innings in four of his last five starts.	"I did pretty well," he said. "I was just trying to be aggressive with my pitches and get some double plays, which I did."	San Diego scored in the fifth after Cory Spangenberg reached on an infield single and advanced to second on Nelson's throwing error. Erick Aybar hit an RBI single.	POIGNANT FATHER'S DAY	Sunday was the first Father's Day for Padres 2B Yangervis Solarte since his wife, Yuliett, died of cancer on Sept. 17, 2016. She was 31. His three daughters, Yanliett, Yuliett and Yulianna have traveled with him on the road since their school year ended. "Everybody knows what he went through last year with the passing of his wife," Green said. "For me, he's life and energy every day. He's that for his girls. I don't think it's a coincidence that his girls finally finished school and came out to San Diego and now are with him on the road and all of a sudden he's hitting. His family gives him life. I know he's happy that his girls are with him now."	HOMER HAPPY	There were 17 home runs in the three-game series, nine hit by the Brewers. They have scored their last 15 runs on homers.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: OF Manuel Margot (strained right calf) is expected to begin a rehab assignment with Triple-A El Paso on Monday. ... RHP Trevor Cahill (right shoulder strain) plans to throw a side session Monday and could face live hitters by Thursday, Green said.	Brewers: LF Ryan Braun (left calf strain) is cleared to play, but Counsell said the slugger "has got to have confidence to take the next step. We're just not quite there yet." Braun is expected to go out on a minor league rehab assignment before rejoining the Brewers.	UP NEXT	Padres: LHP Clayton Richard (5-7) starts Monday night at Wrigley Field against his former team. Richard is 2-1 in three career games vs. the Cubs.	Brewers: RHP Matt Garza (3-2) opens a four-game series with visiting Pittsburgh. After a strong start, Garza has given up 15 earned runs in his last four outings, a span of 20 innings.	---	This story has been corrected to reflect that run charged to Nelson was changed to unearned.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MINNEAPOLIS -- There's still a lot of baseball left to play this season, but it's hard to overlook what the Cleveland Indians did over the weekend.	Edwin Encarnacion homered twice, Trevor Bauer pitched seven strong innings and Jose Ramirez had his sixth straight multihit game on Sunday as the Indians completed a four-game sweep of the Minnesota Twins with a 5-2 victory.	Cleveland came into the series trailing the Twins by two games in the AL Central. The sweep vaulted the Indians two games ahead and gave the defending AL champions sole possession of first place for the first time since May 10.	"I don't want to say we bullied them, but we kind of imposed our will on them, and that's something we've been talking about as a team," Bauer said. "Playing the game the right way with energy and focus and intensity -- that was really good to see."	Bauer (6-5) allowed two runs and four hits with two walks and eight strikeouts. He retired 15 consecutive Twins during one stretch.	"I thought today was far and away his best outing," Cleveland manager Terry Francona said. "He just filled up the strike zone with a bunch of quality pitches. We were thrilled with the way he was throwing the ball."	Andrew Miller worked a hitless ninth for his first save of the season.	Kyle Gibson (4-5) retired nine straight before Encarnacion hit a 443-foot drive to the second deck in left field to put Cleveland on top 1-0 in the third.	Two innings later, the designated hitter did it again, launching a sky-high fly to left that carried into the second deck. The two-run shot was his third homer of the series and 15th of the season and it gave the Indians a 3-0 lead.	"He's a very special hitter, and now we're seeing it," Francona said. "Through the first six weeks it was a fight for him. Right now he's getting locked in and he's dangerous."	Ramirez continued to wear out Twins pitching, going 3 for 4 with two doubles, a walk and two runs scored. He hit a one-out double in the ninth, stole third and scored on Encarnacion's sacrifice fly to give the Indians an insurance run.	For the series, Ramirez was 11 for 18 with four doubles, two homers, six runs and four RBI. He played a big part in the Indians outscoring the Twins 28-7 over the four games.	"Collectively, it was a frustrating series," Minnesota manager Paul Molitor said. "Somehow you've got to get past it, learn from it. They played better. There's no question, they did everything better."	Just don't expect the Indians to let their guard down now that they've regained first place.	"We had a big series here and we did a really good job," Francona said. "Now we'll get on the flight, we'll turn the page quickly, and we'll set our sights on Baltimore. That's our next big series. That's how we always look at it."	ZIMMER ZEROES IN	The Twins had a chance to do some damage in the second but Indians center fielder Bradley Zimmer put a stop to it. With two on and one out, Eddie Rosario lined a single to center. Zimmer came up throwing, and catcher Roberto Hernandez applied the tag to a sliding Max Kepler just in time to keep the game scoreless. "That was a run saved," Zimmer said. "Little things like that are huge. The next couple innings we rally, Eddie hits a couple homers and we're back on top."	WELL RUNS DRY	The Twins had been giving Gibson plenty of support, averaging 10.6 runs per game in his five starts since he returned from a demotion to Triple-A.	TWIN KILLERS	Bauer and the Indians have had their way with the Twins. The right-hander is 3-0 with a 3.26 ERA year against Minnesota this year. Against the rest of the league, he's 2-5 with a 6.34 ERA. Meanwhile, the Indians are 7-0 at Target Field and 8-2 overall against the Twins, a team they'll face again in Cleveland from June 23-25.	QUICK TRIP	The Indians sent 3B Giovanny Urshela to Triple-A Columbus before the game. Urshela was called up for Saturday's doubleheader and went 0 for 4 in the second game. To replace him on the roster, RHP Shawn Armstrong was recalled from Columbus. Armstrong has appeared in nine games for the Indians this season, posting a 5.97 ERA over 12 innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Twins LHP Hector Santiago (strained left shoulder) left the team to begin a rehab assignment at Triple-A Rochester. Santiago threw a bullpen Saturday and is scheduled to start for the Red Wings on Wednesday. Minnesota put him on the 10-day disabled list June 7.	UP NEXT	Indians: RHP Corey Kluber (5-2) starts Monday night in Baltimore against RHP Dylan Bundy (7-5) and the Orioles.	Twins: After a day off, Minnesota welcomes the Chicago White Sox to Target Field for a three-game series. RHP Ervin Santana (8-4, 2.56 ERA) faces Chicago LHP Derek Holland (5-6, 3.79) on Tuesday night.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  After consecutive six-run losses against Texas, the Seattle Mariners got to the Rangers' ace Sunday and earned a long-awaited victory in Arlington.	Kyle Seager drove in three runs with three doubles, Christian Bergman pitched effectively into the sixth inning and the Mariners beat Yu Darvish and the Rangers 7-3.	Danny Valencia's two-run homer capped a four-run first against Darvish (6-5), and the Mariners beat the right-hander for the first time in eight tries on the road. Seager had RBI doubles in the first, third and eighth innings for Seattle, which won at Texas for the first time in its last nine tries.	"Fortunately they didn't catch them today," Seager said. "I thought I had swung all right the previous two days. Today, fortunately I hit it where they weren't."	With Seager pacing the offense, Bergman (4-4) permitted four hits and two runs in 5 2/3 innings after giving up nine runs in 2 2/3 innings in his last start in Minnesota.	"We needed someone to go out and give us innings, keep us in the ballgame," Seattle manager Scott Servais said. "He did a really good job mixing his pitches, threw more curveballs and some off-speed stuff to help him out, and it was huge."	The Rangers pulled within 5-3 against the bullpen in the seventh -- an inning that featured a hit batter, three walks, a balk and a wild pitch -- but Nick Vincent got Nomar Mazara to fly out with the bases loaded to end the threat.	"Somebody needed to step up and he did," Servais said of Vincent.	The Mariners tacked on two runs in the eighth against Dario Alvarez.	Rangers manager Jeff Banister was ejected in the second inning by crew chief Joe West after Seattle's Tyler Smith was awarded first base on a hit-by-pitch on a play that was originally ruled a foul ball.	Darvish was coming off his best outing of the season -- one hit and one run allowed in seven innings against Houston on Monday night -- and he was one out away from getting out of the first unscathed. Seager's double scored one run, a second came in on a passed ball and Valencia blasted a 3-1 pitch into the Mariners bullpen in left-center.	"I put myself in situations where the hitter is going to get the pitch that they look for deep in the count," Darvish said through a translator. "I think that caused me trouble."	Darvish pitched five innings and gave up five runs, the most he's allowed in a start since Sept. 17.	Carlos Gomez hit a two-run homer off Bergman in the second inning and finished the series with eight RBI after returning from the disabled list Friday.	EARLY DEPARTURE	Banister's day ended in the top half of the second inning. Home plate umpire Hunter Wendelstedt had initially said Darvish's pitch hit Smith's bat, but he changed the call after Smith's pleading. Banister confronted Wendelstedt and was in the process of walking back to the dugout when West approached, sparking a more animated conversation and the ejection.	"From our vantage point it was a foul ball and that seemed to be the call on the field," Banister said. "And then all of a sudden it turned into a batter taking first base. My question was: Where did it change?"	ANOTHER PITCHER	Seattle recalled RHP Max Povse from Double-A Arkansas, optioned RHP Rob Whalen to Arkansas and designated LHP Dillon Overton for assignment. Seattle has used 29 pitchers already this season, the most in the majors.	The Mariners also announced the signing of 26 draft picks, including first-round selection Evan White, a first baseman from the University of Kentucky.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: RHP Felix Hernandez (right shoulder inflammation) will return to the Mariners rotation on Friday against Houston. Hernandez allowed four singles and struck out eight in six shutout innings in his second rehab start with Triple-A Tacoma on Saturday. RHP Hisashi Iwakuma (right shoulder inflammation) is also expected to return to the rotation during the weekend series.	Rangers: LHP Cole Hamels (right oblique strain) threw a bullpen session Sunday and is scheduled to make a rehab start at Double-A Frisco on Wednesday. ... OF Peter O'Brien was claimed off waivers by the Los Angeles Dodgers.	UP NEXT	Mariners: Seattle returns home to face Detroit in a four-game series, with RHP Sam Gaviglio (3-1, 3.41) making his first career start Monday against the Tigers. Gaviglio is 3-0 in his last four starts.	Rangers: Texas renews its rivalry with Toronto, hosting a four-game series. Austin Bibens-Dirkx (2-0, 3.28) makes his third career start and his second career appearance against the Blue Jays. He gave up three runs in a four-inning relief appearance on May 26.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

DENVER -- With one dramatic swing, Nolan Arenado gave the Colorado Rockies a thrilling victory and finished off his rare feat at the plate.	Arenado completed the cycle with a three-run homer in the bottom of the ninth inning as the Rockies stunned the San Francisco Giants by rallying for a 7-5 win Sunday.	Arenado hit the first pitch he saw from All-Star closer Mark Melancon (1-2) into the left-field seats to cap a four-game sweep. The slugger was mobbed at home plate by teammates, with a frenzied sellout crowd chanting "MVP! MVP!"	"It's probably one of the best moments in my career," Arenado said. "I've hit some big homers, but by far the best, obviously, for the cycle. I've never done it. I feel like I've been kind of close, but I've always needed a triple and I ain't getting that. Today is a great day."	Arenado became the fifth player in major league history to complete the cycle by hitting a game-ending home run, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. The last to accomplish the feat was teammate Carlos Gonzalez, who did it on July 31, 2010, against the Chicago Cubs.	"I remember watching Carlos do that," Arenado said. "Now I know how he feels."	With the best record in the National League, the surprising Rockies (46-26) have won five straight overall and nine in a row against the Giants. They are 20 games above .500 for the first time since 2009.	"The fans and the people of Denver are starting to get a hint that we're for real," Arenado said.	Colorado had a 3-2 lead in the top of the ninth but gave up three runs before scoring four in the bottom half.	Pinch-hitter Hunter Pence connected on a go-ahead homer for last-place San Francisco, which has dropped six consecutive games and nine of 11.	Melancon retired his first batter, but three singles produced a run and brought up Arenado, who tripled in the first, singled in the fourth and had an RBI double in the sixth. He hit a 91 mph fastball for his 15th homer and first career cycle.	"I was ready first pitch and I was just trying to get the ball to the outfield, really," Arenado said. "Luckily, I got a pitch middle-in and I was able to do some damage with it."	It was his second game-ending homer in the majors and the eighth cycle in club history.	Melancon has not recorded a save since May 27.	"This was as tough a one as we've had," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "I mean, look at those hits [in the ninth]. A blooper into center field, another one that we couldn't quite get to and an eight-hopper to center. The other guy came through, but [Melancon] should have fared a lot better."	Carlos Estevez (4-0), called up from the minors before the game, struck out one batter in the ninth for the win.	Trevor Story and Pat Valaika went deep in the seventh to give Colorado a 3-2 edge after Brandon Crawford's two-run homer in the fifth put the Giants ahead.	Rockies reliever Jake McGee came on in the ninth but issued a one-out walk to Gorkys Hernandez. Pence hit an 0-1 fastball into the left-center seats for his first career pinch-hit homer, and Crawford added an RBI single later in the inning.	Trainer's room	Giants: LHP Madison Bumgarner (left shoulder) is scheduled to throw a second simulated game in Arizona on Wednesday. He threw his first one Saturday, the first time he faced hitters since getting injured in a dirt bike accident in Colorado in April.	Rockies: RHP Chad Qualls was placed on the 10-day disabled list with lower back spasms. The move is retroactive to Friday. ... Rockies RHP Chad Bettis threw 15 to 20 fastballs during a bullpen session, continuing his comeback from treatment for testicular cancer. Bettis, who finished chemotherapy this month, had been throwing off the mound to a catcher in front of the plate. Sunday was the first time he threw the full 60 feet, 6 inches.	Diamond gem	Rockies second baseman DJ LeMahieu showed why he won a 2014 Gold Glove with a great play to save a run in the first inning. LeMahieu was moving to cover second base after Crawford broke from first when Buster Posey hit a grounder toward the vacated spot. LeMahieu reached back to field the ball and tossed it to Story while sitting on the infield. Story stepped on second to start the inning-ending double play. Crawford was initially called safe at second, but the Rockies challenged and the call was overturned.	Up next	Giants: RHP Johnny Cueto (5-6, 4.57 ERA) opens a four-game series at Atlanta on Monday.	Rockies: RHP German Marquez (5-3, 4.19) starts the opener of a key three-game series with Arizona on Tuesday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Jason Vargas never had to worry about clearing his schedule for the All-Star Game. That might be about to change.	Vargas earned his 10th win, most in the majors, and Salvador Perez hit a three-run homer as the Kansas City Royals beat the Los Angeles Angels 7-3 on Sunday.	As the first pitcher to reach double digits in wins, Vargas finds himself ahead of perennial All-Stars such as Clayton Kershaw and Chris Sale. Still, the Royals' unassuming left-hander with the 2.27 ERA isn't locking in travel arrangements to Miami next month just yet.	"I've never been invited to the summer classic, so we'll just see," said Vargas, who allowed three runs and eight hits in six innings. "The coaches have a lot to do with what's going on with the pitching staff. We'll just keep going until the All-Star break and see where things shake out."	Although he ended up with another comfortable win, Vargas (10-3) found himself in trouble early and late. The Angels took a 2-0 lead in the first inning before the streaking Royals offense stepped in.	Mike Moustakas hit a three-run double in the third, giving him 19 RBI this month and providing the Royals with a lead they did not relinquish.	Perez then launched a drive to center field for his 14th homer of the season, leaving Cameron Maybin to climb the wall for show as part of a four-run outburst in the fourth.	"He went out and gave up some runs there early, and we picked him up right away," Royals first baseman Eric Hosmer said about Vargas. "He's been picking us up all season with the outings he has been putting in. That's what good teams do -- they pick up their guy when he slips up a little bit."	Vargas was able to avoid another slip-up before departing. Facing a bases-loaded jam with nobody out in the sixth, he was able to limit the damage to one run, bookending two popups around Ben Revere's sacrifice fly.	Angels starter J.C. Ramirez did not have the same luck. Ramirez (6-5) was pulled after failing to get an out in the fourth, needing 89 pitches to make it that far. He started off well enough by striking out five consecutive batters, but then lost the strike zone. Ramirez walked four and hit a batter with a pitch as he gave up five earned runs.	"Even though he was striking those guys out, he needed a lot of pitches and worked really hard," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "I don't think he ran out of gas. Those guys did a pretty good job in the batter's box against him."	BIG BATS	The Royals went 7-2 on their California road trip and scored at least seven runs in six of those victories, bolstered by 18 homers.	With his team now well on pace to set a franchise record for home runs in a season, Hosmer is most impressed with when they are coming, citing Perez's two-out shot that broke the game open.	"They have been some big homers, too, especially on this road trip," Hosmer said. "As long as they keep coming in big spots like that, we'll take every single one."	Hosmer picked up his 500th career RBI earlier in the fourth.	OH, SO CLOSE	When Kole Calhoun doubled off the very top of the wall in right field to drive in a run for the Angels in the first, even he wasn't sure what to make of the play. Scioscia came onto the field thinking it was definitely worth another look. The umpires agreed, initiating a video review.	It turned out the call on the field was absolutely right.	"I think that's about as close as you can get to a home run without getting one," Scioscia said.	Calhoun went 3 for 5, notching his 16th RBI over the last 18 games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals: Perez and DH Brandon Moss were back in the lineup after getting a rest during a 9-0 loss Saturday. ... Whit Merrifield got the afternoon off and was replaced at second base by Ramon Torres.	Angels: CF Mike Trout (thumb) will start swinging a bat next week, but Scioscia isn't ready to deviate from the previously announced timetable of a six-to-eight-week recovery. "He's about where you would expect a guy with his injury to be looking at," Scioscia said.	UP NEXT	Royals: RHP Jason Hammel (3-6, 5.05 ERA) faces Boston's Hector Velazquez (1-1, 6.48) on Monday, marking his first appearance against the Red Sox since 2013. Hammel has allowed just one run in each of his last two starts.	Angels: RHP Parker Bridwell (1-0, 2.79) takes injured Matt Shoemaker's spot in the rotation Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium for the start of an eight-game road trip. Bridwell has never started against the Yankees, but did toss 3 2/3 innings as a reliever against them on Wednesday, giving up one run and seven hits. Michael Pineda (7-3, 3.71) pitches for New York.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  A week ago, the first-place New York Yankees came to the West Coast on a roll. They were scoring more than enough runs to support their starters and winning by comfortable margins.	They are headed home to the Bronx in a June skid, emotionally and physically spent from the California heat, long games and losing so many close ones.	Khris Davis hit a go-ahead two-run homer in the third that held up to back rookie Jharel Cotton's first victory since May 4, and the Oakland Athletics completed a four-game sweep of the slumping Yankees with a 4-3 win Sunday.	"Not very fun," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "They're not going to be perfect all the time. For the rest of the year these guys are going to be somewhat tired, that's just the bottom line."	Davis hit his team-best 18th homer in the third after Chad Pinder tied the game on a two-run double that inning. Davis' leadoff double in the sixth was wasted.	New York welcomed back flame-throwing closer Aroldis Chapman but still lost its season-high sixth straight game following a six-game winning streak, finishing a disappointing 1-6 road trip with a weekend dud against the American League's worst team.	"As long as the feel of the team is still positive and energetic, guys aren't putting their head down and we're still having fun and enjoying each other, I think everything will be fine," Matt Holliday said. "These things happen during a season. You're going to go through stretches like this. You find out what you're made of."	Cotton (4-7) struck out six over 6 1/3 innings for his second-longest start of the season after going seven innings April 10 at Kansas City. The rookie right-hander, who had been 0-4 over a five-start winless stretch since beating the Twins, gave up six hits and three runs with a walk.	The A's won their fourth straight game, marking the club's second-longest winning streak of 2017 behind a stretch of five in a row April 18-22. Oakland had gone 26 series without a sweep dating to last Sept. 12-15 at Kansas City.	Holliday hit a towering solo homer in the second that reached the top of the elevated bleachers then Aaron Judge had an RBI single in the third on a scorching Sunday. First-pitch temperature at the Coliseum was 90 degrees -- the hottest to start a game since it was 91 degrees on June 20, 2008. The warmest day for baseball ever here was 92.	Chapman came off the disabled list after missing more than a month and pitched a 1-2-3 eighth. New York needs him late in games, and Girardi was determined to use his flame-throwing closer regardless of the situation to immediately get him back in major league action.	Oakland's Sean Doolittle pitched the ninth for his third save and second in as many games after coming off the DL on June 10.	"Against a team that's that good, one of the best teams in the American League, to come away with a four-game sweep is really big for us," said Doolittle, who spent time in the clubhouse to stay cool.	Didi Gregorius homered leading off the fourth for the Yankees, who lost three of the games here by one run. The umpires reviewed the drive to determine whether the ball stayed just inside the right-field foul pole, and their original call of home run was confirmed.	New York catcher Gary Sanchez was written into the lineup after going through pregame work to test his tender groin, an injury from Thursday night.	Yankees right-hander Luis Cessa (0-1) allowed four run and five hits in four innings, struck out four and walked in his first start this year and second appearance.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: CF Aaron Hicks missed his third straight day with tightness in his left leg that he experienced during Thursday night's 10-inning loss. ... LHP Chapman had been out since May 13 with inflammation in the rotator cuff of his pitching shoulder. ... Holliday returned to the lineup at DH after sitting Saturday with an allergic reaction to something he ate.	Athletics: Starting RHP Andrew Triggs, on the 10-day DL with a strained left hip, was scheduled for a cortisone injection. ... Home plate umpire Ted Barrett took a ball off the left knee in the fifth but was fine to stay in the game.	DELAYED	The Yankees were delayed slightly getting out of San Francisco on Sunday morning after the lower deck of the Bay Bridge was partially shut down going out of the city toward Oakland for at least five hours. Officers responding to a crash shot and wounded a motorist who drove at them. Girardi said the team's bus got moving once two lanes reopened.	UP NEXT	Yankees: Following an off day Monday, RHP Michael Pineda (7-3) goes for his team-best eighth victory as the Yankees host the Los Angeles Angels.	Athletics: RHP Daniel Gossett (0-1), who allowed seven runs in his first career start and outing last Wednesday at Miami for the most ever by an Oakland pitcher in his major league debut, pitches the series opener against the Astros.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

HOUSTON --  David Price wasn't great on Sunday night, and he didn't have to be. The best strike Boston threw to home plate came from left field, anyway.	Xander Bogaerts went deep twice for the first multihomer game of his career and had four RBI, Andrew Benintendi threw out a runner trying to score and the Red Sox beat the Houston Astros 6-5.	Bogaerts had just two homers entering Sunday's game. He ended an 0-for-14 skid when he connected off Joe Musgrove (4-6) to make it 1-0 with two outs in the first inning.	A two-run shot by Bogaerts in the sixth put the Red Sox up 3-2. Jackie Bradley Jr. added a two-run double later that inning.	The Astros cut the lead to 6-5 on an RBI single by Carlos Beltran with one out in the eighth inning. Jose Altuve was thrown out at home on that play by Benintendi , and then Yuli Gurriel struck out looking to end the inning and was ejected after arguing the call.	An inning later, catcher Christian Vazquez caught Houston's Derek Fisher stealing to end the game.	"Bogey offensively is the difference in this one, but our ability to throw the baseball on the defensive side is what preserved this win tonight," manager John Farrell said.	Price (2-1) got the win despite tying a season high by allowing eight hits with three runs and three walks in five-plus innings.	Price was asked to evaluate how he's pitched in the five games since coming off the disabled list on May 29.	"It's just been terrible," he said. "It's been bad. It's not me. I can throw the baseball better. That's the bottom line."	Houston pulled within 5-4 with homers from Jake Marisnick and George Springer in the sixth, but an RBI single by Bogaerts added an insurance run in the seventh.	Boston tied the New York Yankees atop the AL East. Craig Kimbrel allowed one hit in a scoreless ninth for his 20th save.	James Hoyt plunked Mookie Betts in the right knee with one out in the seventh before hitting Dustin Pedroia in the back with a pitch. That caused home plate umpire Greg Gibson to issue warnings to both benches as Pedroia glared and yelled at Hoyt. Both managers came onto the field as Pedroia continue to scream and pointed at the mound before calming down and heading to first base.	Pedroia left the game in the bottom of the ninth and Farrell said the second baseman was getting X-rays at a local hospital after the game.	Betts was hit by a ball on his right elbow diving back to second base later in the inning and was favoring it the rest of the game.	Carlos Correa, Marisnick and Springer each hit a solo homer for the Astros, who went 3 for 15 with runners in scoring position and lost for the fifth time in seven games.	"They took advantage of almost all of their opportunities and we struggled in a couple of those," manager A.J. Hinch said.	Marisnick ended Price's night when he launched a fastball onto the train tracks beyond left field to start Houston's sixth. He was replaced by Heath Hembree, who ended a streak of 26 straight scoreless innings by Boston's bullpen when he allowed the homer to Springer to get Houston within 5-4.	Musgrove yielded six hits and five runs in 5 2/3 innings.	Correa sent Price's first pitch of the fifth inning into the seats in left field for his 13th home run to put Houston up 2-1.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: LHP Eduardo Rodriguez, who has been out since injuring his knee on June 1, was doing well on Sunday, a day after throwing his second bullpen session and could increase his activity in the upcoming days.	Astros: LHP Dallas Keuchel (pinched nerve in neck) will begin to play catch on Monday for the first time since going on the disabled list on June 5. ... RHP Lance McCullers (back soreness) will throw a bullpen Monday or Tuesday, and if that goes well he could come off the DL next weekend in Seattle. ... RHP Charlie Morton (strained back muscle) will also throw a bullpen on Monday and could begin a rehabilitation assignment soon after that. ... RHP Collin McHugh, who hasn't played all season because of an elbow injury, will go to Florida to begin training for several weeks before hopefully starting a rehabilitation assignment. ... OF Josh Reddick (concussion) will take batting practice on Monday and will likely return to the lineup Tuesday.	UP NEXT	Red Sox: Hector Velazquez (1-1, 6.48 ERA) is scheduled to start for Boston in the first of three games at Kansas City on Monday. He'll make his second major league start after allowing one hit in 3 1/3 scoreless innings of relief in his last outing to get his first major league win.	Astros: Brad Peacock (3-1, 3.00) will start for Houston in the opener of a four-game series at Oakland on Monday. He allowed two hits and one run while striking out a season-high 10 in 4 2/3 innings in his last start.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

BALTIMORE --  While Corey Kluber mowed down the Baltimore Orioles and the Indians ran around the bases at Camden Yards, Cleveland's bullpen did absolutely nothing.	That, as much as anything else, really made it a perfect night for manager Terry Francona.	Kluber pitched a three-hitter for his fifth career shutout, Jason Kipnis and Carlos Santana homered and the Indians extended their longest winning streak of the season to six games with a 12-0 victory Monday night.	Santana and Austin Jackson had three RBI apiece for the AL Central leaders, whose recent surge has lifted them to a season-best six games over .500 (37-31).	Kluber (6-2) struck out 11 and walked none in his 12th career complete game and second shutout this season. The right-hander gave up a first-inning single to Adam Jones, a single to Seth Smith in the sixth and a single to Hyun Soo Kim in the eighth.	To cap it off, Kluber struck out the side in the ninth.	"These nights are rare but you'll take them because you can completely rest your bullpen," Francona said. "That goes a long way."	Francona didn't hesitate to call on his relievers in a four-game sweep at Minnesota. In this one, he never emerged from the dugout until the game was over.	"Your goal every game is to try to finish it," Kluber said. "We played a lot of baseball this last weekend and the (bullpen) covered a lot of innings for us. So I guess that's an added bonus of it."	Cleveland batted around in the fourth and fifth innings and sent eight men to the plate in a three-run sixth that made it 11-0. The Indians banged out a season-high 10 extra-base hits, including seven doubles.	"We did a lot of good things," Francona said.  "We scored and then we kept at it and put our foot on the gas."	Orioles starter Dylan Bundy (7-6) allowed six runs, six hits and three walks in 4 1/3 innings. It was another in a series of poor outings by Baltimore pitchers, who have yielded at least five runs in 16 straight games.	"I didn't have anything," Bundy said. "I was battling out there, trying to get outs, trying to locate as best as I could."	Despite taking two of three from St. Louis last weekend, Baltimore has dropped nine of 12. Beginning with a 6-1 loss to Washington on June 8, the Orioles have been outscored 106-54.	"This is the team that we have, so we just have to go out there and play and try to win," Smith said.	Bundy kept pace with Kluber until the fourth, when Jose Ramirez, Edwin Encarnacion and Lonnie Chisenhall hit successive doubles to get the rout underway. Ramirez has doubled in seven straight games , an Indians record, and Encarnacion's RBI double was his 1,500th career hit.	Jackson capped the four-run fourth with a two-run double . Kipnis and Santana homered in a four-run fifth, and Cleveland continued the onslaught in the sixth against relievers Vidal Nuno and Gabriel Ynoa.	SMALL CROWD	One positive for the Orioles was that only 13,875 fans bore witness to this blowout on a humid night. The game started 29 minutes late because of rain, and by the end there were only a couple thousand fans in attendance.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: OF Michael Brantley was activated from the paternity list and immediately placed on the 10-day disabled list with a right ankle sprain. The injury initially occurred earlier this month, and Brantley aggravated it last week.	Orioles: SS J.J. Hardy was placed on the 10-day DL with a broken right wrist and will miss four to six weeks. ... All-Star closer Zach Britton (forearm strain) put off the start of his rehabilitation assignment by one day because of the threat of rain at Aberdeen. He will start for the Class A club on Tuesday. ... RHP Darren O'Day (right shoulder strain) will pitch a simulated game Wednesday.	UP NEXT	Indians: Josh Tomlin (4-8, 5.83 ERA) seeks his second win in a row Tuesday night after beating the Dodgers on Thursday.	Orioles: Chris Tillman (1-5, 8.07 ERA) takes another crack at earning his second win. He's lost his last five starts and is winless in seven outings since May 7.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

MIAMI --  The celebratory shaving cream in Marcell Ozuna's ears provided a clue: This time it was the Miami Marlins with the walk-off hit.	After blowing leads and losing on the final pitch in back-to-back weekend games, the Marlins overcame an early six-run deficit Monday night, and Ozuna singled home the winning run with two outs in the ninth inning to beat the Washington Nationals 8-7.	Justin Bour helped reverse the script for Miami when he tied the game at 6 in the third with a grand slam , his 18th homer. Giancarlo Stanton also hit his 18th to make it 7-all in the seventh.	"That was a lot of fun," Bour said. "It was a great ballgame to be a part of. We were down six but never really out of it."	Miami bounced back after losing twice in Atlanta on walk-off hits by Brandon Phillips.	"Guys have pretty short memories. You move forward all the time," Marlins manager Don Mattingly said. "We've really had a lot of guys swinging the bat well, and I think it gives us confidence."	Bryce Harper hit his 18th homer for Washington. Anthony Rendon also homered before leaving in the fifth with a neck stinger he sustained diving for a grounder. His status is day to day.	"Nothing too serious," Rendon said. "Just trying to be a little cautious. A little scary; a jolt of pain. We'll see how it feels Tuesday."	Enny Romero (2-3) retired his first two batters in the ninth but walked Dee Gordon on four pitches. Gordon stole second and went to third on a sharp infield single by Stanton before Christian Yelich walked on a 3-2 pitch to load the bases.	Ozuna badly missed a 99 mph fastball to fall behind 0-2. Romero's next pitch was clocked at 96 mph, and Ozuna launched it to the warning track in left-center, triggering a celebration that included a shaving cream pie to his face .	"After swinging at a fastball at 99, I said, `OK, stay short and put the ball in play," Ozuna said. "That's what I did."	The bullpen failure was all too familiar for the Nationals.	"These guys have been giving up runs late," Mattingly said. "You get into that bullpen, you never know what's going to happen, but you know you have a chance to score some runs."	Washington's Tanner Roark squandered a 6-0 lead by giving up six runs in the third and failed to make it through the inning. The right-hander has an ERA of 7.94 in his past three starts.	"You get a six-run lead and give it up -- that's pathetic on my part," Roark said. "You get punched in the face and knocked down, you've got to get back up. This one hurt, but it's a long season and you've got to keep going."	A.J. Ramos (2-3), the Marlins' sixth pitcher, worked around a leadoff walk in a scoreless ninth.	Miami won for the 11th time in the past 13 home games.	GOOD DEFENSE	Nationals center fielder Michael A. Taylor had a two-run single, threw out two runners on the bases and robbed the Marlins of a run with a running, backhand catch on the warning track.	HARPER'S HOMER	Harper was slow to realize he had homered in the first inning. His line drive barely cleared the right-field fence and caromed back onto the field, and the slugger took a big turn before returning to first base, thinking he had settled for a long single. Only then did he realize the umpires were signaling the hit was a home run.	The homer was Harper's second against a left-hander this year. He extended his hitting streak to 12 games.	ROSTER MOVE	Before the game, the Marlins optioned RHP Drew Steckenrider to Triple-A New Orleans so they could reinstate starter Justin Nicolino from the disabled list. Nicolino lasted only three innings in his return from a bruised left index finger. Pitching for the first time since May 30, he allowed six runs, three earned.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: OF Jayson Werth (bruised foot) has yet to begin baseball activities, and there's no timetable for his return, manager Dusty Baker said.	Marlins: 3B Martin Prado (hamstring) and SS Adeiny Hechavarria (oblique) have had two games rained out since beginning minor league rehab assignments, delaying their return to the majors. Both are expected to play several more games before rejoining the Marlins.	UP NEXT	Nationals LHP Gio Gonzalez (6-1, 2.89 ERA) is scheduled to start Tuesday against RHP Edinson Volquez (3-7, 3.72).	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  The Cincinnati Reds are feeling a lot better about themselves after stopping a season-high nine-game losing streak Monday night.	Scott Schebler and Scooter Gennett homered, Joey Votto had three hits and snapped an eighth-inning tie with an RBI single and the Reds beat the Tampa Bay Rays 7-3 in a game that manager Bryan Price characterized as "one of the most satisfying wins that we've had."	The team's longest skid in more than a year dropped the Reds a season-worst 10 games under .500, 7  1/2 games out of first place in the NL Central.	"The reality of it is that no one expects us to do much this year except our club," Price said. "I think everyone wants to stay in it and see what can happen as we get healthy, and you just can't get so far out of it."	Schebler led off the fifth inning with his 19th homer, tying Votto for the team lead. Gennett went deep for the second consecutive day, his first homers since hitting four in a game against St. Louis on June 6, to make it 3-0 in the sixth.	Votto's RBI single off Jose Alvarado (0-2) put the Reds in front for good after Tampa Bay rallied to tie the game on Steven Souza Jr.'s solo homer off Scott Feldman and Daniel Robertson's two-run shot off reliever Michael Lorenzen (4-2).	Rookie Jesse Winker, promoted from Triple-A Louisville earlier in the day to injured shortstop Zack Cozart's spot on the roster, finished Cincinnati's three-run eighth with a bases-loaded single that drove in two to make it 6-3.	The Reds won for the first time since June 8, stopping a skid that was their longest since they dropped 11 straight in May 2016.	"You want all the games to mean something, and so shutting down this losing streak and playing better baseball," is crucial, Price said. "We have to play better ball to stay relevant in this and get back in it with a nice winning streak."	Feldman allowed two runs and six hits over six-plus innings, holding the Rays scoreless until Souza homered off one of the catwalks supporting the roof at Tropicana Field with two outs in the sixth.	Tampa Bay tied it 3-3 in the seventh when Trevor Plouffe singled off Feldman and Robertson followed with a two-run homer off Lorenzen, who retired all six batters he faced after Robertson to get the win.	For the Rays, the game turned as quickly as they got back in it. Alvarado replaced Odorizzi entering the seventh and gave up a leadoff double to Gennett, who scored the go-ahead run on the second of Votto's three hits.	"Yeah, it happened quick. Two good hitters that had good nights," Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash said. "Double, single, hit your cap. They got after it. They didn't get deflated when we tied it back up."	CAN'T KEEP IT IN THE PARK	Odorizzi allowed three runs and five hits over seven innings. He has yielded at least one homer in 10 consecutive appearances, the second longest active streak in the majors behind Jesse Chavez of the Angels. Dating to last Aug. 30, he's allowed homers in 18 of 19 starts -- the lone exception a one-inning, injury-shortened on April 15.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: Cozart (strained right quadriceps) and RHP Bronson Arroyo (strained right shoulder) were placed on the 10-day disabled list. ... RHP Homer Bailey (right elbow) made his third rehab start, and first with Triple-A Louisville, where he allowed two runs and seven hits over 5 2/3 innings against Columbus.	Rays: C Wilson Ramos (right knee surgery) could be ready for his season debut before the end of the month. ... SS Tim Beckham departed after being hit in the left hand by a pitch in the fourth inning. X-rays were negative, and the Rays announced he's day-to-day.	RARE VISIT	The Reds are playing at Tropicana Field for only the third time. They won five or six games on their two previous visits in 2003 and 2011. Tampa Bay's 3-10 record all-time against Cincinnati is the club's worst vs. any opponent.	UP NEXT	Reds: RHP Amir Garrett (3-5), 0-2 in three starts since returning from a right hip injury, takes the mound against Tampa Bay Tuesday night.	Rays: RHP Alex Cobb (5-5) looks to improve on his 8-3 record and 2.81 ERA in interleague starts Tuesday night.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ATLANTA -- R.A. Dickey knew he was close, even if the results didn't show it.	He was right.	Dickey threw seven scoreless innings in his strongest outing of the season, Matt Adams hit another homer and the Atlanta Braves sent the San Francisco Giants to their seventh straight loss, a 9-0 rout Monday night.	The 42-year-old Dickey (5-5) escaped a jam in the first but wound up surrendering just three hits. The knuckleballer retired 16 of the last 17 hitters he faced, including 13 in a row.	"You know it's good when they're swinging and missing," Dickey said. "That means it's in the zone for a while, then out of the zone quickly."	Even after his last outing, when he was tagged for a season-high eight runs by Washington, Dickey insisted his baffling pitch wasn't far off.	"It's hard to see sometimes," he said, smiling. "You have to trust me."	Of course, it helped to be going against the Giants, whose skid is the longest of a hugely disappointing season. San Francisco dropped to 26-46 and fell a staggering 20 games behind first-place Colorado in the NL West.	"Dickey got in a groove with that knuckleball," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "We just couldn't get the barrel to the ball."	Adams homered in the fourth off Johnny Cueto (5-7), driving it deep into the right-field seats. The first baseman added an RBI single in the eighth, sparking a seven-run outburst that made it a rout.	He now has 10 homers and 27 RBI since being acquired from St. Louis on May 20 after Freddie Freeman sustained a fractured wrist.	"We all miss Freddie, but that guy has been everything and more than everything we could've hoped for," Dickey said. "I hope we can find a spot for him when Freddie comes back."	San Francisco started strong. Denard Span led off a game delayed 44 minutes by rain with a double to left, and Eduardo Nunez reached on an infield single. But Brandon Crawford and Hunter Pence popped out to shortstop, sandwiched around Buster Posey's strikeout, to leave the runners stranded.	Cueto also went seven strong innings, surrendering five hits and two runs.	The Braves blew it open against San Francisco's depleted bullpen, scoring all seven runs in the eighth with two outs. Dansby Swanson had a two-run single and Danny Santana hit the first pinch-hit homer of his career, a towering three-run shot off Derek Law that landed in the second deck.	Law faced six hitters, giving up five hits and a walk. He was charged with four runs, boosting his ERA from 4.20 to 5.40.	SUSPENSION UPHELD	The Giants will be a man down for six games after Major League Baseball upheld Hunter Strickland's suspension.	The right-handed reliever plunked Washington star Bryce Harper on May 29, igniting a brawl that led to a three-game suspension for Harper, who has already served his time.	Strickland will miss all four games in Atlanta, as well as the first two games of a weekend series in San Francisco against the Mets.	COLON RETURNS	The Braves plan to go to a six-man rotation, at least temporarily, when 44-year-old Bartolo Colon returns from the disabled list Wednesday to start against the Giants.	The right-hander went down June 6 with what was described as a strained left oblique muscle. The move came a day after he gave up eight runs in 3 2/3 innings against Philadelphia, dropping his record to 2-7 with a 7.78 ERA.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Giants: OF Jarrett Parker (fractured right clavicle) began a rehab assignment Monday with Triple-A Sacramento.	Braves: Micah Johnson could soon be headed for a rehab assignment, and Sean Rodriguez is making big strides in his recovery.	The jack-of-all-trade players have yet to get on the field this season. Johnson sustained a broken left wrist making a diving catch in a spring training game, while Rodriguez sustained a torn left rotator cuff during an offseason car wreck that also injured his wife and two sons.	Johnson is much closer to returning, but Rodriguez is aiming to get back on the field before September.	UP NEXT	Giants: LHP Matt Moore (2-7, 6.00) gets the start Tuesday coming off the shortest outing of the season. He gave up eight runs and 11 hits in just three innings at Colorado. San Francisco is 3-11 in Moore's starts, including a current stretch of five straight losses.	Braves: RHP Julio Teheran (6-4, 4.86) makes his sixth career start against the Giants. He is 2-2 with a 3.99 ERA in his previous appearances, the most recent win coming in 2013.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

MILWAUKEE --  Gerrit Cole has all but forgotten a recent four-game stretch where he failed to pitch past the fifth inning.	For the second consecutive start, Cole pitched seven strong innings, and the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the Milwaukee Brewers 8-1 on Monday night. He also chipped in with a key hit to start a four-run outburst in the seventh.	"He was in attack mode from pitch one," Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said.	Cole (5-6) held the Brewers to one run and three hits. He struck out five and walked two. He gave up one run in his previous outing on June 13 against Colorado.	"We made a lot of good pitches and kept them off balance just enough," Cole said.	Andrew McCutchen hit a two-run homer for Pittsburgh and has gone deep four times in his last six games.	"It's effortless power," Hurdle said. "That ball jumped off the bat."	Travis Shaw's leadoff homer in the second put the Brewers ahead 1-0 and set a franchise mark, with the Brewers scoring their 16th consecutive run via the long ball.	The Pirates took the lead in the third on Adam Frazier's two-run single off starter Matt Garza (3-3).	McCutchen extended the lead with his homer in the sixth that chased Garza, who gave up four runs and six hits in 5 1/3 innings. He walked two and recorded three strikeouts.	"I fell into a pattern, threw too many fastballs and he hit it out," Garza said.	Pittsburgh added four runs on five hits in the seventh off reliever Wily Peralta. Cole started the inning with a single, his third hit in 25 at-bats this season, and scored on Josh Harrison's double.	"A lot of times those rallies start really innocently," Hurdle said.	AFTER THE FALL	The Pirates scored one of their four runs in the seventh when Brewers left fielder Hernan Perez tripped and somersaulted while attempting to throw home after Gregory Polanco's single. The ball squirted away from Perez, who was charged with an error. He appeared to injure his right wrist as he attempted to brace his fall but remained in the game after being examined by trainers.	SOGARD SHINES	Eric Sogard continues to perform at a high level since taking over at second base with Jonathan Villar sidelined with a lower back strain. Sogard, who has a .458 on-base percentage in 31 games with the Brewers this season, is likely to remain in the lineup once Villar returns. "Eric Sogard continues to play at a really high level and get on base at a really incredible pace," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. "He's been a productive offensive and defensive player." Counsell said "there's space" to give Villar, who has a .213 batting average, some playing time. "But we're looking for the players who are helping us win games," he said.	OUCH	Pittsburgh's Josh Harrison was hit by a pitch in the ninth. It's the 12th time this season he's been hit, tied for most in the National League.	CUT LOOSE	The Brewers released reliever Neftali Feliz, who had been designated for assignment Wednesday. Feliz began the season as the team's closer after signing a one-year, $5.35 million contract.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: RHP Juan Nicasio, who didn't pitch for two consecutive games due to arm fatigue, was available out of the bullpen. "(The trainers) couldn't come up with anything structurally," Hurdle said.	Brewers: Villar, who is on the 10-day disabled list with a lower back strain, could begin a rehab assignment this week. ... The team took a cautious approach with rookie reliever Josh Hader, who warmed up three times in the bullpen on Sunday but didn't appear. "It's very rare that you're going to have somebody up in three separate innings," Counsell said. ... Sogard was hit on the left foot by Jhan Marinez's pitch in the eighth. He slowly limped to first base but remained in the game.	UP NEXT	Pirates: Chad Kuhl (1-6) has lost his last six decisions and hasn't gone more than five innings in any start since April 18. He is 1-0 with a 1.76 ERA in three career starts against the Brewers.	Brewers: Zach Davies (7-3) is 1-2 with a 9.56 ERA in four career starts against the Pirates. He notched his lone win on May 7 in Pittsburgh, giving up two runs in 5 2/3 innings.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Wins in the past two playoff matchups, a couple of victories in Toronto during a three-game set earlier this season and now a ninth-inning rally in Texas.	The Blue Jays are finding ways to beat the Rangers, even if Jose Bautista was roughed up a bit by Rougned Odor in that wild brawl a little more than a year ago.	Kendrys Morales hit a go-ahead single after a tying single by Josh Donaldson in the ninth, and Toronto beat rival Texas 7-6 on Monday night.	The Blue Jays won despite blowing a 5-1 lead in their first visit to Texas since last postseason, when they won the first two games in a best-of-five sweep that was their second straight Division Series victory over the two-time defending AL West champs.	"I guess there's a little bad blood between us, but I think it's all in the past now," Toronto starter Marco Estrada said. "I don't think anybody even thinks about it, to be honest."	Donaldson's single off closer Matt Bush scored Ryan Goins, who just beat the throw to second for a leadoff double. Morales' hit to the gap in left-center scored Donaldson from second after a stolen base and a walk. It was the third blown save in 11 chances for Bush (2-2).	The Rangers have already replaced one closer in Sam Dyson, who was eventually traded to San Francisco.	"Anytime you lose a game like that, they're challenging," manager Jeff Banister said. "However, again, I'll repeat, rewind and repeat about what I say about this team, where they're able to bounce back and move on."	Jeff Beliveau (1-0) pitched a perfect eighth, and Roberto Osuna worked a 1-2-3 ninth for his 18th save in 22 chances. The Blue Jays got 5 1/3 scoreless innings from five relievers.	"I'm proud of all of them," manager John Gibbons said. "It was a tough game on both sides. Both starters gave up runs early and then both bullpens shut the teams down until the end."	Toronto's Steve Pearce and Adrian Beltre of the Rangers traded three-run doubles in the fourth, with Beltre's liner to right-center capping a five-run inning for a 6-5 lead that held up until the ninth.	Bautista, whose fight with Odor at second base in the final regular-season game in Texas last season had its roots in his epic bat flip in a dramatic Game 5 win in 2015, started the Blue Jays' four-run fourth with his 12th home run, a 442-foot shot over the lower-deck seats in left.	Elvis Andrus had a two-run single before Beltre's hit as three pitchers for both teams combined for 79 pitches in the fourth.	Justin Smoak had three hits, including a career high-tying 20th homer to get the Blue Jays even in the second after Nomar Mazara's ninth homer for Texas in the first, a 435-foot drive to the second deck in right.	SCUFFLING STARTERS	Estrada struggled for a fourth straight start, allowing seven hits, four walks and six runs in 3 2/3 innings to push the right-hander's totals to 35 hits and 23 runs in 16 1/3 innings during that span. Austin Bibens-Dirkx gave up two homers and five runs over five innings in the third career start for the 32-year-old rookie right-hander. He struck out five.	BELTRE WATCH	With his double, the 38-year-old third baseman in his 20th major league season pulled even with Harmon Killebrew on the career RBI list with 1,583. Beltre also passed Al Kaline at 1,582. Beltre drew even with Cal Ripken at 23rd on the career list for extra-base hits with 1,078. He's at 2,959 career hits.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: RHP Joe Smith was placed on the 10-day disabled list with a sore right shoulder, and RHP Leonel Campos was brought up from Triple-A Buffalo to replace him.	Rangers: LHP Cole Hamels (right oblique strain) is scheduled for his second rehab start Wednesday with Double-A Frisco. He could rejoin the rotation next week in Cleveland. He's been out since May 4. ... RHP A.J. Griffin (left intercostal strain) was moved to the 60-day DL to make room on the 40-man roster for Tanner Scheppers, who was called up from Triple-A Round Rock. OF Jared Hoying was sent down.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays: LHP Francisco Liriano (3-2, 5.36 ERA) makes his fourth start since returning from a left shoulder injury. He's coming off his longest outing of the season, seven innings against Tampa Bay. He gave up three runs -- two earned -- with nine strikeouts in a no-decision.	Rangers: RHP Nick Martinez (1-3, 4.67) gets his second start since pitching four scoreless innings in his only relief appearance of the season. His first eight outings were starts.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

CHICAGO --  Anthony Rizzo thrived in the leadoff spot again for the Chicago Cubs. However, it was his collision with San Diego catcher Austin Hedges on a play at home that had the Padres fuming.	Willson Contreras hit a tying home run, Javier Baez scored the winning run on an error and Wade Davis worked out of a ninth-inning jam to lead the Cubs past the Padres 3-2 Monday night.	With the Cubs trailing 2-1 in the sixth, Rizzo led off with a triple. One out later, Kris Bryant hit a liner to shallow center that Matt Szczur made a running catch on and fired home to get Rizzo for the inning-ending double play -- the fourth San Diego double play to that point behind starter Clayton Richard.	Hedges got the ball early and moved to apply the tag. Rizzo didn't slide and sort of dropped down to his knee as he crashed into the catcher, who tumbled backward. Hedges had to leave the game with a bruised right thigh.	"I think you look at that play and it's a fairly egregious violation of the rule," San Diego manager Andy Green said. "The rule exists to protect the catcher. The safety of the catcher is more in jeopardy now when you have the rule to protect you because you're not expecting to get hit when you give a guy a plate like that.	"That's a cheap shot. I'm not saying he's a dirty player at all -- nobody is saying that -- but he clearly deviated from his path to hit our catcher, took our catcher out. Rule exists to protect him. It's a disheartening play to see come about like that."	No one on the Cubs' side saw it that way.	"It's one of those plays where it's very sensitive," Rizzo said. "It's a play where I'm out by two steps. If I slide, he runs into me.	"I've talked to a lot of umpires about this rule. It's my understanding if they have the ball, it's game on."	Chicago manager Joe Maddon agreed with his star player.	"You don't see it anymore because the runner thinks he has to avoid (the catcher) -- he doesn't," Maddon said. "If the guy's in the way, you're still able to hit him.	"I'd much prefer what Riz did tonight. What he did was right, absolutely right. There's nothing wrong with that and nobody can tell me differently."	Rizzo extended his career-high hitting streak to 13 games by going 2 for 3 with an RBI.	Jose Pirela and Yangervis Solarte each had a solo homer for the Padres, although Pirela's error allowed the winning run to score.	Hector Rondon (2-1) pitched a scoreless inning for the win. Davis had runners on second and third with one out, but struck out Wil Myers and got Hunter Renfroe to ground out for his 14th save in 14 chances.	Kirby Yates (1-1) allowed one unearned run to get the loss.	Szczur, claimed off waivers by the Padres from the Cubs last month, went 0 for 2 with a walk and a hit by pitch in his return to Wrigley Field.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: RHP Trevor Cahill (right shoulder strain) is with the team, but is expected to leave for a rehab assignment in the next few days.	Cubs: SS Addison Russell (sore right ankle) and OF Jason Heyward (left hand abrasion) didn't start. Russell, though, entered in a double switch at the start of the seventh. . 2B Ben Zobrist (left wrist) is eligible to come off the 10-day DL on Friday, but is uncertain if he'll be ready. "I'll probably see how it feels on Wednesday," Zobrist said. ... LF Kyle Schwarber left the game after fouling a ball off his right ankle. X-rays were negative.	UP NEXT	Cubs LHP Mike Montgomery (0-3, 2.56 ERA) goes in the middle game of the series and will face Padres RHP Jhoulys Chacin (6-5, 5.10).	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  The fortunes of Jason Hammel and the Kansas City Royals have taken similar turns this season.	Both started with high expectations, endured a miserable first month that left many fans writing them off, then found a spark somewhere along the way.	Hammel's latest starring role came Monday night, when he held the powerful Boston Red Sox in check for seven sharp innings. And when Whit Merrifield drove in the go-ahead run in the bottom of the seventh, and Mike Minor and Kelvin Herrera closed it out, the Royals had a 4-2 win -- their eighth in nine games.	"That's about as good of a lineup as you're going to run into," Hammel said after his fourth straight quality start. "To keep them to six singles and a homer, I feel pretty good about it."	Eric Hosmer hit a two-run homer and Lorenzo Cain also drove in a run for the Royals (34-35), who can climb back to .500 for the first time since April 19 with a win Tuesday night.	Minor loaded the bases with two outs in the eighth, but No. 9 hitter Christian Vazquez sent a slow bounder toward third base that Cheslor Cuthbert fielded cleanly and fired to first to end the threat.	Herrera worked around Andrew Benintendi's triple in the ninth for his 16th save.	Red Sox reliever Blaine Boyer (0-1), who pitched out of a jam in the sixth, gave up a triple to Drew Butera in the seventh when Jackie Bradley Jr. couldn't make a diving catch in center. The Royals brought in pinch-runner Ramon Torres, who scored when Merrifield sent a grounder through the left side.	"He threw me some pitches to hit and I kept missing," Merrifield said. "Late, he started to throw me two-seamers and it was actually a pretty good pitch. I just found a hole."	It was the second straight game in which Boston's stingy bullpen has allowed a pair of runs, the slump coming on the heels of 26 consecutive scoreless innings.	Hammel (4-6) scattered seven hits without a walk, stranding seven along the way, and the only damage against him came in the fourth. That's when he gave up a leadoff single to Hanley Ramirez, and the hot-hitting Bradley sent a 1-0 pitch over the bullpen in right for a two-run homer that tied the game.	Boston right-hander Hector Velazquez was nearly as good as Hammel in his second career start, carefully navigating a bunch of baserunners during the first two innings. Hosmer finally dinged him in the third with an estimated 446-foot shot into the fountains in center.	Velazquez turned it over to his faltering bullpen after giving up five hits in 5 1/3 innings.	"He gave us everything we could have hoped for tonight," Red Sox manager John Farrell said. "You get a little bit of an idea and a game plan knocked out before the game and he did exactly what we would have hoped, which was to keep the game close, keep it under control and get us into the sixth inning."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: 2B Dustin Pedroia was out of the lineup after getting hit in the ribs by a pitch Sunday in Houston. An MRI came back negative, and Farrell said Pedroia is day to day. ... LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (right knee) will face hitters this week before embarking on a rehab assignment.	Royals: C Salvador Perez got the night off from the starting lineup, though he entered late when the Royals ran for Butera. The time off came as Perez deals with some soreness in his side.	SIGN ON THE LINE	The Royals and first-round draft pick Nick Pratto agreed to a contract that includes a $3.45 million signing bonus. The high school first baseman, chosen with the 14th overall selection, will head to rookie ball in Arizona on Tuesday to begin his professional career.	MAKING MOVES	Royals RHP Kevin McCarthy was recalled from Triple-A Omaha and LHP Eric Skoglund was optioned back to the Storm Chasers before the game. McCarthy is in his second stint with the club this season.	UP NEXT	Red Sox: LHP Chris Sale comes off his best start in more than a month -- and his first defeat during that span -- when he takes the mound Tuesday. The major league leader in strikeouts allowed one run and four hits over eight innings with 10 strikeouts in a 1-0 loss at Philadelphia last Thursday.	Royals: LHP Matt Strahm makes his second career start after allowing one unearned run over five innings in a 7-2 win against the Angels last week. Strahm retired 14 of the final 16 batters he faced.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

SEATTLE --  When Mike Zunino was shuttled off to the minors in the early days of May, the Seattle Mariners catcher was hitting .167, had yet to hit a home run and had just two RBI in 24 games.	That background makes what Zunino has done at the plate over the past month even more stunning, a surge that continued with two more home runs on Monday night in a 6-2 win over the Detroit Tigers.	Zunino went deep twice, both times two-run shots. They weren't cheap either. The first snapped a 2-all tie in the sixth inning and carried over the bullpens in left field. The second came in the eighth inning, a shot to center field that provided Seattle a bit of cushion.	Since returning from the minors on May 23 with a retooled stance and approach at the plate, Zunino is hitting .338 with nine home runs and 28 RBI. He's already set a new franchise record for the most RBI in any month by a catcher.	"To me, it's just trust the routine and trusting the process," Zunino said. "I'm in the cage trying to do the same routine, everything, every day. Trying to be as disciplined as I can in batting practicing, driving the ball the other way, and it's paid off. It's not an easy game. You take at-bats for what they are, and when you get some results, they're nice."	Guillermo Heredia lined a two-run homer in the fifth inning to pull Seattle even at 2-all, and Zunino's shot an inning later gave Seattle the lead. Quickly behind in the count against Alex Wilson (1-4), Zunino worked it to 3-2 and drove a slider out to left field.	His homer in the eighth came on a 1-0 fastball from Francisco Rodriguez.	The trio of homers handed the Tigers their third straight loss and ninth in the last 13 games.	"We couldn't come up with big hits, and they hit home runs," Detroit manager Brad Ausmus said.	While the home runs grabbed the attention, Seattle manager Scott Servais was more pleased with how Zunino handled the pitching staff, especially during a tricky sixth inning. Detroit had the bases loaded with just one out, but James Pazos (2-1) got out of the bases-loaded jam with strikeouts of Mikie Mahtook and Andrew Romine.	Four Seattle relievers combined to hold Detroit to two hits over the final four innings.	"We love the home runs. Believe me, I love them as much as anybody," Servais said. "But taking that next step as far as leading our pitching staff tonight was huge and really came through."	Heredia's homer was his fifth of the season and the only major mistake by starter Anibal Sanchez. Making his first start of the season, Sanchez scattered five hits over five innings. He pitched out of a bases-loaded jam in the second inning but couldn't get through the fifth unscathed.	Sanchez had made 11 appearances as a reliever for Detroit before being sent to Triple-A Toledo and making four starts in the minors.	"Sometimes you need to refresh a lot of things," Sanchez said. "That is what I did in my time in the minor leagues and figure out how I can be successful here."	FINAL START?	Seattle starter Sam Gaviglio struggled with his control, walking four and letting his pitch count climb early, but avoided any big innings. Gaviglio made it through five innings, allowing just a bases-loaded groundout and Ian Kinsler's RBI double. But Gaviglio's spot on the 25-man roster is uncertain with the return of Felix Hernandez and possibly Hisashi Iwakuma to the rotation later this week.	Gaviglio has allowed two earned runs or less in five of his seven starts. But he's finished six innings only twice.	ON THE FARM	Iwakuma and SS Jean Segura both struggled in their rehab outings at Triple-A Tacoma on Monday. Iwakuma lasted just two innings, giving up four runs and four hits. He was supposed to throw 70 to 75 pitches, but was pulled after throwing just 49. Segura, recovering from a high ankle sprain, played five innings at shortstop and was 0 for 3 at the plate. The Mariners hope to get Segura back later this week.	UP NEXT	Tigers: Jordan Zimmermann (5-5) tries for his fourth straight quality start. Zimmermann threw eight innings in his last outing against Arizona, his longest start in nearly a year.	Mariners: Ariel Miranda (6-3) looks to rebound from a loss in his last start when he allowed 10 hits and six runs.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- ��� As good as the Houston Astros have been at home this season, they've been even better on the road while piling up wins at a ridiculous rate.	It's a fact that's not lost on manager A.J. Hinch, although he's not inclined to read much into it just yet.	George Springer hit his 20th home run, Jake Marisnick and Derek Fisher also went deep and the Astros beat the Oakland Athletics 4-1 on Monday night.	Evan Gattis and Alex Bregman both doubled twice to help the Astros improve to a major league-best 24-8 on the road while winning their seventh straight at the Coliseum.	"Twelve months ago I was asking why we were so terrible on the road and we were really good at home," Hinch said. "I think it's more coincidence. This is the same core group of guys that struggled on the road before. We don't take ourselves too seriously. We don't flaunt it. We don't have too much arrogance. We like our team. We like our guys."	Brad Peacock (4-1) struck out eight in 5 2/3 innings. He retired 16 of his first 18 batters and didn't allow a runner past first until Matt Joyce's one-out double in the sixth.	"Just working on the fastball, throwing the slider for strikes and throwing it for balls when I needed to," Peacock said. "I'm not really trying to strike anybody out. I'm just trying to make pitches and trying to go deep in the game."	Three relievers combined to get 10 outs for Houston. Ken Giles pitched the ninth for his 17th save.	Jed Lowrie doubled in Oakland's run. The A's were coming off a four-game sweep of the AL East-leading New York Yankees but fell 15½ games behind the first-place Astros in the AL West.	Marisnick hit his ninth homer on a 2-2 pitch from rookie starter Daniel Gossett (0-2), a two-run drive that bounced off the façade underneath the lower row of luxury suites in center field.	Springer homered off John Axford leading off the eighth.	Fisher's home run came in the ninth but the outfielder was informed after the game that he was being optioned to the minors to make room for Josh Reddick, set to come off the disabled list Tuesday.	The A's scored their lone run in the sixth. After Joyce doubled and Chad Pinder walked, Lowrie hit a ball into right-center. Joyce scored easily but Pinder was thrown out at home on a relay by shortstop Carlos Correa.	"At that point, you've got to send him and take a chance," Oakland manager Bob Melvin said. "We know Correa's got a good arm but we weren't doing a whole lot. When you get an opportunity to potentially tie the game, you've got to send him."	CALL OVERTURNED	Springer led off the game with a sinking liner to left that Oakland's Khris Davis initially appeared to catch after diving for it. The ball popped out of Davis' glove after he hit the turf and skidded, but third base umpire Mike Everitt signaled out. The Astros challenged and the call was overturned following a replay review.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: RHP Lance McCullers Jr. threw a bullpen before the game and could return to the rotation this week. ... RHP Charlie Morton (lat strain) will likely need two to three rehab starts in the minors to build up arm strength, Hinch said. ... LHP Dallas Keuchel (neck) played catch before the game.	Athletics: 3B Matt Chapman was held out with a left knee infection. ... SS Marcus Semien (wrist) will begin a rehab assignment this weekend. ... RHP Kendall Graveman (right shoulder strain) threw in the outfield and came out fine.	FAMILY FIRST	Oakland bench coach Mark Kotsay took an indefinite leave of absence to be with his daughter, who suffered an eye injury. Chip Hale will fill in for Kotsay, and Steve Scarsone replaced Hale as third base coach.	UP NEXT	Oakland RHP Sonny Gray (2-2, 4.44 ERA) faces Houston for the first time this season Tuesday night. Astros RHP Francis Martes (1-0, 5.19) makes his second major league start.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

LOS ANGELES --  Cody Bellinger has 21 home runs, matching his age. No hitter in history has gotten off to such a powerful start.	The rookie slugger launched two more long balls to set a major league record, and Clayton Kershaw notched his 10th win despite giving up a career-high four homers Monday night as the Los Angeles Dodgers held on for a 10-6 victory over the New York Mets.	Bellinger reached 21 home runs in 51 career games -- faster than any other big league player. Despite spotting the rest of the NL three weeks before he was called up from the minors, the 21-year-old first baseman leads the league in homers.	"It's unbelievable," Mets manager Terry Collins said. "This guy swings a bat and he hits it on the barrel. Pretty impressive."	Bellinger had his fifth multihomer game of the season, tying five others for the second-most by a rookie. Mark McGwire holds the record with seven.	"You just have a really good feeling that every time he's up to the plate, he's going to do some damage," Kershaw said. "Everything he's hitting is hit really hard. His outs are loud outs right now."	Kershaw (10-2) struck out 10 and became the first 10-game winner in the National League despite giving up plenty of hard hits himself. The three-time Cy Young Award winner already has allowed a career-high 17 homers this year.	"I don't know. I'm giving up a lot of home runs right now," Kershaw said. "You hope your mistakes are hit for singles or doubles. It just so happens mine are going out of the ballpark right now. I don't know what you do to change that, other than stop making mistakes."	Justin Turner hit a two-run homer and Chris Taylor had a solo shot for the Dodgers, who jumped out to a 7-0 lead against struggling Mets starter Zack Wheeler (3-5) in the first two innings.	Turner had four hits and four RBI against his former team. Bellinger also drove in four runs.	"You cannot spot Clayton Kershaw seven runs and expect to come out on top," Collins said. "We just couldn't stop them."	Kershaw allowed two homers to Jose Reyes, including a two-run drive in the seventh inning. Jay Bruce also connected and rookie Gavin Cecchini hit a two-run shot for New York.	It was Cecchini's first homer in his ninth career at-bat.	Kershaw was charged with six runs on six hits and a walk in 6 1/3 innings. His ERA jumped from an NL-best 2.23 to 2.61.	Los Angeles' first five batters got hits, including Bellinger's three-run homer. Bellinger followed Turner's home run in the second with a solo shot.	The Dodgers finished with a season-high 17 hits. They have won 10 of 11 and are a season-high 19 games over .500 at 45-26.	Wheeler gave up seven runs and eight hits in two innings. He was coming off the worst start of his career last Tuesday, when he lasted only 1 2/3 innings against the Cubs.	The right-hander's ERA has risen from 3.45 to 5.29 in two outings.	RARE AIR	Gary Sanchez (2016 New York Yankees) and Wally Berger (1930 Boston Braves) both had 20 home runs through 51 games, but it took Berger 55 games and Sanchez 59 to reach the 21-homer mark.	DERBY DISCUSSION	Bellinger said he hasn't been asked to participate in the Home Run Derby during All-Star festivities in Miami next month, but would be a willing participant. "I think it would be pretty cool," he said. "It would be pretty special if my dad could throw to me. He's been throwing BP to me my whole life." Bellinger's father, Clay, played in the majors from 1999-2002 with the Yankees and Angels. He hit 12 home runs in 183 career games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: LF Yoenis Cespedes was back in the lineup after getting his first full day off Sunday since coming off the disabled list. Cespedes missed six weeks with a strained hamstring before returning June 10 and playing eight consecutive games (six starts). He was hitting .458 since his return. ... CF Juan Lagares had surgery in New York to repair a fracture in his left thumb.	Dodgers: 1B Adrian Gonzalez received an epidural for his herniated disk. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said the team remains hopeful Gonzalez will return before the All-Star break. ... Right-handed reliever Sergio Romo (left ankle sprain) was activated from the DL and struggling RHP Josh Fields was optioned to Triple-A Oklahoma City.	UP NEXT	Mets: RHP Robert Gsellman (5-4, 5.50 ERA) is coming off his worst outing of the season, when he yielded seven earned runs on a career-high 11 hits and two walks in five innings against the Nationals in New York. On the road this season, Gsellman is 4-1 with a 4.32 ERA.	Dodgers: RHP Brandon McCarthy (5-3, 3.14) has allowed more than two runs in only two of his previous 11 starts. He is 3-1 with a 2.83 ERA in six starts at Dodger Stadium.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

BALTIMORE -- Another poor outing by their starting pitcher left the Baltimore Orioles facing an early three-run deficit and the prospect of another lopsided loss.	Then Manny Machado took over.	Machado went 4 for 4, homered twice and drove in four runs to help the Orioles beat Cleveland 6-5 on Tuesday night and end the Indians' six-game winning streak.	After absorbing a 12-0 defeat one night earlier, Baltimore fell behind 5-2 before rallying to win for only the fourth time in 13 games.	"Coming back from the game we had (Monday) night -- they really took it to us -- it was good to come out ahead against a real good team," manager Buck Showalter said.	Machado hit a solo homer in the first inning and tied it with a three-run drive in the fifth. Then, in the seventh, Machado doubled off Bryan Shaw (1-2) and scored on a double by Adam Jones.	Machado's first four-hit game since last August lifted his batting average 13 points to .227.	"Just happy I was able to do something for us today," Machado said. "We played great baseball. That's what we've got to keep doing, picking each other up."	Miguel Castro (1-0) worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the seventh to earn his first big league victory.	Brad Brach pitched the ninth for his 13th save, retiring Yan Gomes on a deep fly ball with runners on the corners and two outs.	Orioles starter Chris Tillman allowed five runs and eight hits in four-plus innings, but Baltimore's comeback enabled him to avoid losing a sixth straight start.	Asked to sum up his outing, Tillman uttered three words: "Not very good."	The Orioles allowed at least five runs in a 17th consecutive game. That's the longest run in AL history and just three short of the dubious major league record of 20 set by the 1924 Philadelphia Phillies.	Juan Encarnacion homered for the Indians, whose season-high winning streak thrust the team into first place in the AL Central.	"Nobody wants to lose, but I don't think this loss will affect tomorrow," manager Terry Francona said.	Cleveland starter Josh Tomlin yielded a season-high three homers in 4 2/3 innings. The one pitch he lamented most was the cutter he threw to Machado with two on in the fifth.	"I didn't execute a pitch and it changed the game," he said.	EXTRA SPECIAL	Cleveland's Jose Ramirez hit two singles to become the first Indians player to have at least two hits in eight straight games since Kenny Lofton in June 1996. On Monday, Ramirez set a modern-day record with 14 extra-base hits over a seven-day span.	FIRST PITCH	Actor Michael Kelly, who plays White House chief of staff Doug Stamper on "House of Cards," threw out the ceremonial first pitch. Kelly said he "practiced all week" for his big moment -- then short-hopped the throw to the plate.	ROSTER MOVES	The Orioles transferred closer Zach Britton (forearm strain) to the 60-day DL, a move that allowed the team to select the contract of OF Craig Gentry from Triple-A Norfolk and add him to the 40-man roster. Britton went on the DL on May 5 and isn't expected to return until just before the All-Star break. ... Baltimore also recalled LHP Donnie Hart from Triple-A Norfolk, and optioned INF David Washington and LHP Vidal Nuno to Norfolk.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: OF Brandon Guyer (sprained wrist) went 1 for 2 in his third rehab outing for Triple-A Columbus on Tuesday afternoon. He's 3 for 6 with a home run and two walks since his assignment began. . RHP Danny Salazar (shoulder soreness) threw a bullpen session Monday and did some fielding drills on Tuesday, manager Terry Francona said.	Orioles: Britton began his rehabilitation assignment with a scoreless inning for Class-A Aberdeen. ... Darren O'Day (right shoulder strain) could come off the DL on Friday if all goes well after his simulated game Wednesday.	UP NEXT	Indians: RHP Carlos Carrasco (7-3, 3.21 ERA) makes his first start at Camden Yards since 2014 on Wednesday night. He's 5-1 with a 2.89 ERA away from home this season.	Orioles: RHP Kevin Gausman (3-6, 6.60 ERA) starts for the Orioles. In his first 15 starts, he made it through seven innings only once.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

NEW YORK --  Tyler Clippard walked off the mound, stared straight ahead and walked to the dugout as many of the 39,853 fans at Yankee Stadium booed.	Cameron Maybin hit a tiebreaking home run on the struggling reliever's second pitch of the night, Kole Calhoun lined a double to right-center on his eighth, Albert Pujols hit a warning-track flyout on his 11th and Yunel Escobar tripled off the top of the left-field wall , just above the glove of leaping Brett Gardner, on his 12th and last.	In a little more than a week, New York's season has gone from promising to plummeting.	"It's super frustrating," Clippard said after Tuesday night's 8-3 loss to the Los Angeles Angels extended the Yankees' losing streak to seven games, their longest in a single season since April 2007.	A week ago, the Yankees led the AL East by four games after winning the opener of a West Coast trip at Angel Stadium. But even with the return of closer Aroldis Chapman from the disabled list last weekend, New York dropped out of first place for the first time since mid-May and trails Boston by a half-game.	"We've got to catch them now," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "I think a lot of times you find out a lot more about your club now than you do when you're going through great times."	Even with reliever Adam Warren on the disabled list, Girardi is reluctant to use setup man Dellin Betances for six outs, preferring he pitch only the eighth to hold leads.	"I think you could do it for a short period of time, but I think it starts to wear on guys physically because of the long season," Girardi said. "We might have to look at some different things."	Aaron Judge hit his major league-leading 24th home run and Gary Sanchez his 12th as New York climbed back from a 3-0 deficit.	Clippard (1-4) allowed runs for the third time in four outings. After Jonathan Holder relieved, Luis Valbuena singled through a drawn-in infield to drive in another run.	"It's up to all of us in here to pick ourselves up and get it right, and that's what we're going to do," Clippard said. "We all expect that out of ourselves. I expect that out of myself. I don't think any of us are worried about it."	Los Angeles, which outhit New York 14-4 despite missing injured AL MVP Mike Trout, had lost its nine previous games at Yankee Stadium and 18 of 21. In one of the season's quirkier stats, the Angels improved to 12-0 on Tuesdays.	Maybin had three hits and two RBI, including a run-scoring chopper in the eighth.Valbuena added a solo homer off Holder in the ninth.	"We did a lot of good things, without our best player," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "That points to the depth we need to establish in our lineup."	Blake Parker (3-2) allowed Sanchez's tying home run in the sixth. Parker Bridwell, taking the rotation spot vacated when Matt Shoemaker went on the disabled list, gave up two runs, two hits and five walks in five innings.	Michael Pineda allowed three runs -- one earned -- and seven hits in 5 2/3 innings.	"He battled really, really well tonight considering he had no location on his fastball, basically zero," Girardi said.	Los Angeles went ahead nine pitches in when Pujols' single scored Maybin , who doubled leading off, and the Angels opened a 3-0 lead in the second with a pair of unearned runs after Eric Young Jr.'s leadoff grounder rolled under the glove of first baseman Chris Carter for a two-base error.	Bridwell held the Yankees hitless through three innings , although he needed 65 pitches to do it.	"I could have been more efficient," he said.	SKID	New York had a seven-game losing streak encompassing the end of the 2011 season and the start of 2012.	YOU'RE THE TOP	Maybin has a 10-game hitting streak and is batting .400 with 10 doubles and four home runs since being moved to the leadoff spot on May 16.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: Los Angeles closer Bud Norris went on the 10-day DL because of right knee inflammation and RHP Mike Morin was recalled from Triple-A Salt Lake. ... Trout, sidelined since May 28 with a torn ligament in his left thumb, was to start swinging at a facility near his home in New Jersey and progress this weekend to hitting off a tee and soft toss. ... Shoemaker (strained muscle in his right forearm) threw on flat ground from about 90 feet. ... RHP Huston Street, sidelined since spring training by a strained latissimus dorsi muscle is his back, allowed one hit over 1 1/3 innings for Salt Lake in a rehab outing on Monday and could be activated this week.	Yankees: CF Jacoby Ellsbury, out since sustaining a concussion on May 24, is to take batting practice Wednesday. Aaron Hicks returned to center field and went 0 for 2 with a pair of walks after missing three games because of a sore left Achilles tendon. ... Warren, who hasn't pitched since June 13 because of right shoulder inflammation, is to play catch on Friday.	UP NEXT	Rookie LHP Jordan Montgomery (4-4) starts Wednesday night for the Yankees against RHP Ricky Nolasco (2-8) and the Angels. Nolasco is winless in nine starts since April 27, losing his last six.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

MIAMI --  Gio Gonzalez had some worrisome moments on the mound Tuesday night, including when a friend sitting in the first row behind the Washington Nationals' dugout was hit in the head by a flying bat.	"Next time in the front row everyone will be wearing a helmet," Gonzalez said.	The friend later said he was fine, and Gonzalez felt good too after pitching seven innings to beat the Miami Marlins 12-3.	Gonzalez (7-1) allowed three runs, including two on Marcell Ozuna's 19th homer , but struck out eight and won his fourth consecutive decision.	"Exactly what we needed," manager Dusty Baker said. "Gio's throwing the ball great."	He had plenty of support even before a five-run ninth. Bryce Harper started the scoring with a two-run single that extended his hitting streak to 13 games, and Daniel Murphy had two RBI and hit his 12th homer . Stephen Drew had three hits and three RBI, while Ryan Zimmerman drove in three runs with a double and a single.	Gonzalez, who grew up in nearby Hialeah, improved to 7-3 in 13 starts against his hometown team with an ERA of 2.19. He had a cluster of friends and relatives in attendance, and that's where Justin Bour's bat went when it slipped from his hands on a swing in the fifth inning.	"It's good to have friends here, but put them somewhere safe," Gonzalez said.	He said his pal who was hit received a souvenir later as compensation for being clubbed.	"Bour gave him a bat, which is pretty cool on his part, because we want the fans to come back," Gonzalez said.	The left-hander said it was too early to talk about the possibility of pitching in the All-Star game, which will be played in his hometown next month. His teammates are rooting for it.	"Gio has been great," Harper said. "I'm hoping he pitches like this the rest of the first half and gets the start here. It would be incredible to see."	The NL East leaders went 7 for 14 with runners in scoring position, but it was still 0-0 when Edinson Volquez (3-8) walked Michael A. Taylor and Trea Turner in the third inning, and they advanced on a double steal.	With two outs, Harper tried to bunt on the first pitch -- a curious move by the slugger -- and pushed it foul. He golfed the next pitch into center for the Nationals' first hit to put them up 2-0.	"I don't hit Volquez very well," Harper said. "If I can lay a bunt down with a guy at third and get a knock and score a run ... but it worked out."	Pitching to Harper backfired for Miami, so the next time he came to bat, when the Nationals again had a runner in scoring position, Marlins manager Don Mattingly opted for an intentional walk. Zimmerman foiled the strategy with a two-run double.	"They've got a good lineup," Mattingly said. "They put you in a box in a number of ways."	Volquez allowed a season-high six runs in 4 2/3 innings.	HITTING STREAK	When someone brought up Harper's hitting streak, he feigned a grimace.	"I'll probably go 0 for 4 tomorrow. I appreciate that," he said. "Nah, I'm just trying to have good at-bats, and good things will happen."	The streak is the longest of Harper's career in a single season.	NOT STOPPING	Ozuna ran through a stop sign to score Miami's first run. Ozuna reached on a single in the fourth and came around on a double by J.T. Realmuto, ignoring third-base coach Fredi Gonzalez's signal to hold at third and easily beating the throw home.	As the Marlins celebrated, Gonzalez looked into their dugout with a sheepish shrug.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: Drew replaced 3B Anthony Rendon (sore neck), who was held out of the lineup but was available in an emergency.	UP NEXT	Nationals RHP Max Scherzer (8-4, 2.26) is scheduled to face RHP Dan Straily (5-4, 3.58) in the rubber game of the series Wednesday afternoon. Scherzer has at least 10 strikeouts in each of his past five starts, and he leads the NL in ERA and strikeouts.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Corey Dickerson helped the Tampa Bay Rays build up a big lead Tuesday night, and then they almost let one get away against the Cincinnati Reds.	"You're going to take every win, but we better start cleaning it up, simple as that," said Rays manager Kevin Cash after his club held on for a 6-5 victory.	Tampa Bay made a couple of sloppy plays in the outfield that helped the Reds rally from a 6-2 deficit and get the tying run on base in the ninth. Tucker Barnhart's triple, his third hit of the game, drove in a run in the eighth after a double by Devin Mesoraco. The triple fell between Dickerson, who had barely missed a line drive over his head earlier, and center fielder Peter Bourjos, on the warning track.	"We play in a dome," Cash said sternly. "Make the adjustments."	The Rays were saved by their early offensive output and a strong start. Dickerson went deep, Alex Cobb threw seven solid innings and Tampa Bay took a 6-3 lead into the ninth.	Dickerson had his 29th multihit game of the season, tied with New York's Starlin Castro for the American League lead. He drove in Tampa Bay's first run with a third-inning single, then capped their scoring with his 16th home run in the fourth.	Cobb (6-5) gave up two runs and eight hits while striking out six. Alex Colome pitched the ninth for his 20th save.	Joey Votto hit his 20th home and Eugenio Suarez drove in another run off Colome. But the Reds, who had 12 of their 13 hits with two outs, lost for the 10th time in 11 games.	"Anybody that thinks this is a team that's packing it in because we've been losing some games this month doesn't know the ballclub," Reds manager Bryan Price said. "You've got one of the top closers in the American League and next thing you know we're one swing of the bat away from having the lead and having our closer in the game."	Cincinnati starter Amir Garrett, who has struggled in four starts since returning from the disabled list, gave up three walks in the third inning after the Reds had taken a 2-0 lead. Dickerson drove in a run with his first hit, and Logan Morrison's two-run single put the Rays ahead 3-2.	Jesus Sucre and Dickerson homered in the fourth to push Tampa Bay's lead to 6-2. Sucre's homer was the Rays' 25th in 13 games.	"We have to start playing better defense, but we can hit," Morrison said. "If our defense can pick it up and we don't have to use (Colome) so much, we can make it a little easier on ourselves. But a team like that with a good lineup, you give `em extra outs, it's going to get tight."	Garrett (3-6) has given up seven home runs and 18 earned runs in 13 1/3 innings his last four starts.	FIRST PITCH AT 103	The ceremonial first pitch was thrown by 103-year-old Lt. Cmdr. Jim Downing, who was a gunnery mate on the USS Virginia during the attack on Pearl Harbor. Downing, who was onshore when the attack began, is the second-oldest living survivor of Pearl Harbor.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: RHP Homer Bailey (elbow) will probably make his first start of the season at Washington this weekend if he feels well after a bullpen session in Louisville on Wednesday . ... LHP Brandon Finnegan (left shoulder) is scheduled to make his third rehab start Wednesday with Triple-A Louisville.	Rays: SS Tim Beckham, who took a pitch off his left hand Monday night, was out of the starting lineup. ... C Wilson Ramos (right knee surgery) and reliever Brad Boxberger (right flexor strain) could be ready for their season debuts this weekend or early next week.	UP NEXT	Reds: RHP Tim Adleman (4-3) is 2-1 with a 2.25 ERA over his previous five starts. He takes the hill in Wednesday's series finale.	Rays: RHP Erasmo Ramirez (3-2) looks to rebound Wednesday from a four-start stretch where he went 0-2 with a 10.06 ERA. As for the possibility that Ramirez's rotation spot is in jeopardy, Cash said "I don't think we're there yet."	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

ATLANTA --  Mired in an awful season, the San Francisco Giants desperately needed a break.	The Atlanta Braves provided one.	After Dansby Swanson botched a potential double play, rookie Austin Slater hit a three-run homer that sparked the Giants to a 6-3 victory over the Braves on Tuesday night and snapped a seven-game losing streak.	"I knew I hit it good," Slater said. "I didn't know if I hit it high enough. I'm glad it got out."	His second big league homer broke a stretch of 16 scoreless innings for the Giants, who were routed 9-0 in the series opener.	"The kid bailed us out," manager Bruce Bochy said.	Matt Moore (3-7) pitched seven strong innings for his first win in over a month, and the shaky Giants bullpen protected the lead.	Julio Teheran (6-5) was up 2-0 and cruising toward his first home win since opening night at SunTrust Park, only to be let down by his defense in the eighth inning. The Braves were charged with three errors in all, but Swanson's miscue was the big one.	On the very next pitch, Slater lined one into the right-field seats for his second homer of the season. The Giants went on to score five runs in the inning, also taking advantage of throwing errors by reliever Ian Krol and first baseman Matt Adams.	Mark Melancon worked the ninth for his 11th save in 15 chances.	The Braves jumped ahead in the third. Johan Camargo lined one over the head of center fielder Denard Span for a run-scoring triple and came home on a sacrifice fly by Ender Inciarte.	It looked like the lead would stand up until the Atlanta defense fell apart.	Hunter Pence reached on a grounder to third base that was generously ruled a hit after Camargo dropped the ball trying to make the throw. Brandon Belt followed with a sharp grounder to second baseman Brandon Phillips, who picked it off and threw to Swanson for what should have been a force out at the very least.	Swanson was looking to get two -- only he bobbled the ball away trying to rush his relay throw. Umpire Quinn Wolcott initially ruled Pence was out, but the call was overturned when the review showed the rookie shortstop never had control of the ball.	Slater's homer put the Giants ahead for the first time all night, and they tacked on two insurance runs while getting only one ball out of the infield.	"It was a weird inning," Braves manager Brian Snitker said. "We didn't make enough plays in that inning. It's hard when you give a major league team extra outs."	Josh Osich and Sam Dyson worked out of trouble in the bottom half, Belt homered in the ninth to pad the lead and Melancon closed it out.	SMALL CONSOLATION	San Francisco (27-46) not only snapped its season-long losing streak, the Giants also avoided matching the franchise's worst 73-game record in more than a century.	The 1985 Giants had just 26 wins in their first 73 games. That team went on to finish last in the NL West with a 62-100 mark.	One must go back a lot further to find an even worse start. In 1902 -- 56 years before the franchise moved from New York to San Francisco -- the Giants were 22-48 after 73 games, not counting a tie and two no-decisions.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Giants 3B Eduardo Nunez continues to be bothered by an ailing hamstring, forcing him to sit out the game and undergo a precautionary MRI to ensure there's not a more serious problem.	Nunez missed three games last weekend before returning to the lineup for the series opener in Atlanta. He was able to play the entire game, but apparently tweaked the hamstring running out an infield single in the first inning.	When Nunez reported tightness Tuesday morning, the Giants decided to hold him out of the game. Bochy hopes he'll be able to return to the lineup in a day or two.	UP NEXT	Giants: RHP Jeff Samardzija (2-9, 4.81) will try to avoid becoming the first pitcher in the majors with double-figure losses this season. He is tied for the most losses with Boston's Rick Porcello.	Braves: After initially planning to bring Bartolo Colon off the 10-day DL, Atlanta announced that a stiff back would keep the 44-year-old out of action a bit longer. Rookie LHP Sean Newcomb (0-2, 2.19) will move up to take his regular turn in the rotation.	---	Follow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 .

MILWAUKEE --  Chad Kuhl got a lift when Andrew McCutchen put on another hitting clinic at Miller Park, and it was enough to get over a growing hump.	Kuhl got his first victory since April, McCutchen homered for the fifth time in seven games and the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the Milwaukee Brewers 7-3 on Tuesday night.	Jose Osuna's three-run homer highlighted the Pirates' six-run first inning. McCutchen's two-run single and David Freese's RBI hit accounted for the other runs, all scored before Zach Davies (7-4) recorded a second out.	McCutchen matched his season high with three hits and has hit 19 homers at the home of the Brewers, his highest total outside of 89 at PNC Park.	"I was in a good spot before I got here," McCutchen said of his approach at the plate. "I'm just remaining consistent with that and having the same approach."	McCutchen is batting .406 with six homers and 19 RBI in 17 games in June. He has hit safely in each of his last 10 games at Miller Park and is batting .442 with four home runs and 13 RBI in that span. Asked if there was something in Milwaukee that brought out his best, he had a quick reply.	"Oh, no. I thought like I was already the best before I got here," McCutchen said. "Just following suit."	Kuhl (2-6) went 12 starts without a win after beating Atlanta 6-4 on April 8. The young right-hander allowed two runs and seven hits over five innings, walked two and matched his career high of six strikeouts.	His slider was particularly effective against the Brewers.	"I had that working for me tonight," he said. "I need that in some big situations. That put-away slider that I've been looking for. It came up big tonight."	The Brewers had their chances against Kuhl but couldn't capitalize, going 2 for 11 with runners in scoring position.	"Tonight, we created opportunities," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. "Felt like we had traffic in a whole bunch of innings, but the hit with runners in scoring position was not there."	McCutchen, who also singled and walked, hit his 14th home run in the third and 30th against the Brewers, which tied him with the New York Mets' Jay Bruce for the most among current opposing players.	Relievers Edgar Santana, Tony Watson, Daniel Hudson, Juan Nicasio and Felipe Rivero combined to protect the lead and help the Pirates improve to 4-0 in Kuhl's four career starts against Milwaukee.	Nick Franklin homered in the second and doubled in a run in the third for Milwaukee.	The Brewers got a run and two reviews in the sixth.	First baseman Osuna stretched for a low throw and cradled the ball at the top of his glove, but Orlando Arcia was called safe when the ball came loose. After a 2-minute, 3-second review, the call was confirmed. Arcia scored on a double by Keon Broxton. A couple of pitches later, he was out trying to steal third, a call confirmed after a 1:20 review.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: C Francisco Cervelli missed the game with flu-like symptoms. Nicasio, who hadn't pitched for three consecutive games due to arm fatigue, came on to start the eighth.	Brewers: INF Jonathan Villar, on the 10-day disabled list with a lower back strain, could begin a rehab assignment this week. The team wasn't sure where.	THAT'LL LEAVE A MARK	Pittsburgh's Josh Harrison was hit by a pitch in the first and in the sixth. That's 14 times this season he's been plunked, the most in the majors. He came into the game tied with the Cubs' Anthony Rizzo.	"It's unfortunate," Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said of the number of times Harrison has taken one for the team. "It's getting a little out of hand."	UP NEXT	Pirates: RHP Trevor Williams (3-3, 5.16 ERA) makes his 15th appearance and ninth start of the season. He faced Milwaukee on Sept. 22, 2016, at Miller Park when he allowed one run in 2 2/3 innings of relief.	Brewers: RHP Junior Guerra (1-1, 2.84 ERA) makes his seventh start of the season and first against the Pirates. He went 1-0 with a 1.50 ERA in three starts against Pittsburgh last season.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

CHICAGO --  Anthony Rizzo said all his talking is making him an annoying teammate.	The new leadoff hitter is making up for it with his bat, lifting the Chicago Cubs with another first-inning homer Monday night in a 4-0 victory over the San Diego Padres.	"I'm sure my teammates are starting to get a little tired of it because I'm constantly in their ears," Rizzo said. "Non-stop, telling them, `Make sure you don't miss it."	He hasn't been missing anything at the top of Joe Maddon's batting order.	"It's like on nightly basis, he's ready to go," Maddon said. "He ready, he's chirpy, he's loving this and it's helping us out incredibly."	Rizzo's home run on the second pitch from Jhoulys Chacin (6-6) was the third leading off in seven games since Rizzo was moved to first in the order. In those seven games, he is 6 for 6 with a walk to open the first inning.	It also extended his hitting streak to a career-high 14 games and came on the day Rizzo took a call from the league office about a collision at home plate with Padres catcher Austin Hedges the previous night.	MLB Chief Operating Officer Joe Torre told Rizzo on Tuesday that he violated Rule 7.13, which protects catchers from such collisions, but that he would receive no discipline. He was called out on the play.	Rizzo's home run was his 17th of the season. Rookie Ian Happ added his ninth in the eighth inning for the Cubs, who won their third straight.	Mike Montgomery (1-3) allowed three hits and two walks in six innings, striking out four. Twelve of his other 14 outs came on ground balls.	The left-hander started the season in the bullpen, but his last three appearances have been as a starter.	"I think it was just a great overall win for us, a great feeling all around," Montgomery said. "It felt like a well-played ballgame, the bullpen came in and did a great job shutting it down. It's a lot of fun when you can win like that."	Carl Edwards Jr. and Pedro Strop both allowed two baserunners apiece but pitched out of jams while each throwing an inning, and Justin Grimm had a perfect ninth.	The Padres had five hits but left eight runners stranded.	"I don't think it's really men in scoring position, I just think we have to be better offensively all the way across the board," Padres manager Andy Green said. "I think each guy has got to kind of look at themselves and realize how they're being pitched, continue to use their mind and continue to use their fight."	Addison Russell hit an RBI single in the fourth inning to make it 2-0. Pinch-hitter Albert Almora Jr. added an RBI double in the eighth.	Chacin struck out six batters in six innings, allowing two runs and five hits. Catcher Luis Torrens had two hits.	RINGS TRUE	Padres pitchers Trevor Cahill and Clayton Richard received their World Series rings from the Cubs hours before Tuesday's game.	Cahill had a 2.74 ERA in 50 appearances for the Cubs last season, but didn't make the playoff roster. Richard pitched in 25 games with a 6.43 ERA before being released and picked up by the Padres.	Cahill (seven games) and Richard (15) have appeared exclusively as starters this year for San Diego.	LINE ONE	Rizzo said he had no intent to injure Hedges on Monday's controversial play, which earned the call from Torre.	"It's a tough baseball rule and there's a lot of gray area," Rizzo said. "The league looked at it, and it's over with now."	Green and Hedges both said they expect the catcher to return to the lineup soon after suffering a deep thigh bruise in the collision.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: 2B Yangervis Solarte (strained left oblique) was removed from the game in the first inning without taking the field or batting. Green said he hurt it before the game in one of his final swings in the batting cage. The manager said he anticipates a trip to the disabled list for the clean-up hitter.	Cubs: Outfielders Jason Heyward and Kyle Schwarber were held out with injuries. Heyward badly scraped up his left hand sliding for a foul ball on Sunday and missed his second straight game, while Schwarber fouled a ball off his right ankle on Monday.	UP NEXT	The teams will meet for the series finale Wednesday as Cubs RHP Eddie Butler (3-2, 4.41) faces Padres RHP Miguel Diaz (1-1, 7.36).	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Miguel Sano has taken to calling Kennys Vargas "Lil' Big Papi," a nod to retired Dominican slugger David Ortiz.	Vargas certainly looked the part on Tuesday night, albeit from the right side of the plate.	Vargas hit a 483-foot drive and Sano added another long homer to help the Minnesota Twins bounce back from a demoralizing sweep by beating the Chicago White Sox 9-7 on Tuesday night.	When he got to the dugout, "they tell me I'm a monster," Vargas said with a laugh.	The homers helped the Twins overcome a rough outing from Ervin Santana (9-4), who gave up six runs on 10 hits and struck out six in five innings. Brandon Kintzler pitched the ninth for his 18th save in 21 tries.	Jose Abreu went 4 for 5 with a home run and two doubles for the White Sox, and Avisail Garcia had a homer and two RBI. He leads the American League with a .339 batting average.	Derek Holland (5-7) allowed seven runs and nine hits in 2 2/3 innings for Chicago.	"It was a pretty embarrassing performance. I'm really upset about the whole thing, because I had the stuff coming out of the `pen," Holland said. "To go out to the game and let it slip up like that is just unacceptable."	The Twins won for just the 15th time in 39 games at Target Field, tied with the White Sox for fewest home wins in the American League. This one was much-needed after Cleveland took four straight at Target Field to sweep the Twins out of first place in the AL Central last weekend.	Sano got things started for the Twins with a two-run shot in the first inning, and Vargas' drive landed in the second deck in left-center to highlight a five-run third that put Minnesota up 7-4. Only Yankees rookie Aaron Judge (495 feet) and Milwaukee's Keon Broxton (489 feet) have hit longer home runs this season, according to MLB's Statcast.	The White Sox pulled to 8-7 on Abreu's solo homer in the sixth, but Garcia made two errors in right field in the eighth to give the Twins a little cushion.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Twins LHP Hector Santiago will make a rehab start for Triple-A Rochester on Wednesday. He is scheduled to throw four innings or 60 pitches.	STRANDED	The White Sox left 14 runners on base, including the bases loaded in the sixth inning and two in the seventh and eighth.	"The more chances we give ourselves, the greater the chance is in the long haul that we're going to drive those guys in," manager Rick Renteria said. "I think falling behind the way we did a little bit later on and still battling back and giving us an opportunity, I'll take it."	BULLPEN BOUND	Phil Hughes appears headed back to a relief role for the time being.	Hughes is scheduled to join Rochester on Wednesday and pitch one inning of relief as the Twins look for ways to utilize him without taxing his arm. He has been on the disabled list with biceps inflammation since May 22.	Hughes pitched out of the bullpen early in his career with the New York Yankees, making 44 appearances in 2009, but hasn't done it extensively since 2011. Twins manager Paul Molitor said moving Hughes to the bullpen is the only remedy they see that could work right now.	"As far as long term how we are going to get him stretched out, that's still a question for us," Molitor said. "In the short term, he has a chance to help us in shorter stints."	GEE ON BOARD	The pitching-starved Twins reached a verbal agreement with right-hander Dillon Gee on a minor league deal.	The 31-year-old Gee chose free agency after being outrighted by Texas last weekend. He had a 4.15 ERA in 13 innings for the Rangers this season. He was coming off thoracic outlet syndrome and will report to Rochester.	UP NEXT	White Sox: LHP David Holmberg (1-0, 2.63 ERA) pitches the second game of the series. He is 1-0 with a 3.71 ERA in four starts this season.	Twins: RHP Jose Berrios (6-1, 2.74) gets the ball. The 22-year-old Berrios has gone at least six innings in five of his seven starts and is coming off of a career-high eight innings in a win over Seattle last week.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Chris Sale had just shut down one of the hottest teams in baseball, helping the banged-up Boston Red Sox take over sole possession of first place in the AL East for the first time all season.	And he looked as if he wanted to punch a wall.	Sale was two outs shy of his second consecutive complete game when Boston manager John Farrell trundled to the mound Tuesday night. But the left-hander's pitch count had already reached 110 on the way to an 8-3 victory over the Kansas City Royals, so Farrell's decision to summon a reliever was relatively easy.	If a bit hard to swallow for his competitive ace.	"A little frustrating," Sale said, "but at the end of the day we got the win. We're good."	Sale (9-3) gave up a homer to Mike Moustakas in the second inning and a two-run shot to Jorge Bonifacio in the ninth before leaving the game. The five-time All-Star allowed two other hits and a walk while pushing his major league-leading strikeout total to 146.	More importantly, he got a win after going the distance in a 1-0 loss to Philadelphia last week.	"We scored a bunch of runs today. That takes a lot of pressure off a pitcher," Sale said. "You can make mistakes and not have to worry about it. You can just pound the strike zone."	Xander Bogaerts and Sandy Leon each drove in a pair of runs for Boston, which got plenty of production from a lineup missing Pablo Sandoval, Dustin Pedroia and Mitch Moreland to various injuries.	First baseman Sam Travis and third baseman Deven Marrero, recalled from Triple-A Pawtucket earlier in the day, drove in early runs to get the Red Sox off and running. Mookie Betts and Chris Young also had RBI as the new division leaders kept piling on.	Boston jumped a half-game ahead of the rival New York Yankees, who have lost seven in a row for their longest slide in a single season since April 2007.	"It's good to see the way guys have responded when guys have been down," Farrell said. "To do it on the road, to continue to win, that's a sign this team is becoming special."	Most of Boston's damage came against Royals youngster Matt Strahm (2-4), who struggled to follow up his dazzling first career start. The left-hander with a delivery eerily similar to Sale's was hammered for five runs on seven hits and a walk before exiting with nobody out in the fourth.	Strahm allowed one unearned run in five innings last week against the Angels.	"Just mistakes. I've just got to do better with more quality pitches," he said. "Just making quality two-strike pitches was my nemesis today."	Sale dominated a Royals lineup that had slugged its way to eight wins in nine games, striking out the side in the fifth for good measure. The long, lean lefty was finally lifted after Bonifacio's homer and a base hit by Brandon Moss.	The dominant performance came after Sale twirled a complete game in his last start at Kansas City, allowing two earned runs while striking out 10 in a 7-4 victory last Sept. 16 for the White Sox.	"He locates all his pitches, throws hard and has great stuff," Moustakas said. "You just try to put the ball in play, try not to get to two strikes. I was able to do that in that first at-bat."	PAINFUL PANDA	Sandoval went on the disabled list before the game with an inner ear infection. The pain began for the Red Sox third baseman a few days ago, but Farrell said Sandoval's temperature kept climbing. The DL stint also gives Sandoval a mental break after a rough start to the season.	ROSTER MOVES	Along with putting Sandoval on the DL, the Red Sox optioned RHP Austin Maddox to Triple-A Pawtucket.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: Pedroia (ribs) still felt discomfort while swinging in the cage before the game, though Farrell said it's possible the second baseman could play Wednesday. ... LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (right knee) went through fielding practice before the game. He plans to throw to hitters on Saturday.	Royals: LHP Danny Duffy (right oblique) threw about 40 pitches off the mound to hitters before the game and reported no problems. He plans to throw a side session Friday and could begin a rehab assignment next week. "Felt great, looked great," manager Ned Yost said.	UP NEXT	Red Sox: LHP Drew Pomeranz tries to build on a solid start at Houston in the series finale Wednesday afternoon. Pomeranz allowed one run while pitching into the seventh inning against the Astros.	Royals: RHP Ian Kennedy will be coming off his first win since Sept. 11 when he starts for Kansas City. Kennedy retired the first 17 hitters he faced in a 3-1 victory over the Angels.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

DENVER --  Nolan Arenado came through with another big swing for the Colorado Rockies.	Arenado hit a two-run triple off Zack Greinke in the eighth inning, and the streaking Rockies rallied past the Arizona Diamondbacks 4-3 on Tuesday night in the opening game of their NL West showdown.	Carlos Gonzalez homered and saved a run with a diving catch to help Colorado win its sixth straight. The NL West leaders extended their advantage to two games over third-place Arizona, which had won seven in a row. Second-place Los Angeles remained a half-game back of the Rockies after routing the New York Mets.	"I wish the Dodgers and Diamondbacks weren't playing that good. I wish we were leading the division by more games," Arenado said. "But these are the cards we're played. We've got to enjoy it and compete."	Arenado has risen to the challenge. He completed the cycle Sunday with a game-ending, three-run homer against San Francisco, and this time his triple off the scoreboard in right field turned a 3-2 deficit into a 4-3 advantage.	For the second straight game, the Coors Field crowd was chanting "MVP! MVP!" Gonzalez said the same thing to Arenado during a pitching change in the eighth.	"I told him, `That's an MVP thing. You're carrying the team. You're hitting clutch hits," Gonzalez said. "From my view, it's just incredible."	David Peralta and Paul Goldschmidt homered for the Diamondbacks.	"Tough loss," Peralta said. "It happens. It's part of the game. We just have to be ready for tomorrow. We still have two games and can still win this series."	Arizona and Colorado, perhaps baseball's two biggest surprises this season, both entered on a roll. The Diamondbacks are a major league-best 23-9 since May 15, while the Rockies' 23-11 mark since then ranks third.	Those two teams, along with the Dodgers, have the top three records in the National League.	The series opener Tuesday was the biggest game between the clubs since the 2007 NL Championship Series that Colorado won in a sweep. The Diamondbacks took a 3-2 lead on the solo homers by Peralta and Goldschmidt, but the Rockies rallied in the eighth against Arizona's ace.	Charlie Blackmon and DJ LeMahieu singled off Greinke (8-4) with one out. Arenado followed with his second triple in as many games off the scoreboard in right.	"Our third baseman is doing Kobe Bryant things," Gonzalez said. "He's just on a different level. It's fun to watch. He's carrying this team on his shoulders."	Arenado laughed at the comparison to the Los Angeles Lakers great.	"I'm not at that level yet," he said. "That's (our) favorite basketball player, so we always say we have to have a Kobe mentality. That's pretty cool and nice of him to say, but hopefully I'll get on that guy's level one day."	Adam Ottavino (1-1) got the win despite allowing Goldschmidt's 17th homer. Greg Holland pitched the ninth for his 25th save in 26 chances.	The Rockies took a 2-0 lead with a run in the second on a throwing error and a home run by Gonzalez in the fourth. It was his fifth career homer off Greinke.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: OF A.J. Pollock (groin strain) experienced quad tightness during a game for Triple-A Reno on Monday. Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said Pollock would take it easy and will be evaluated after going through "normal pregame activity" on Thursday.	Rockies: LHP Tyler Anderson (left knee inflammation) could be activated from the 10-day disabled list after a successful rehab start Sunday. Anderson, who last pitched for the Rockies on May 30, went five innings and allowed one run for Triple-A Albuquerque. ...

LOS ANGELES --  Corey Seager suddenly joined the Los Angeles Dodgers' home run parade Tuesday night, and right-hander Brandon McCarthy thinks he knows what prompted him.	The Dodgers' other young star, rookie Cody Bellinger, has been making history en route to the National League home run lead.	"Whatever Bellinger's doing, I don't understand," McCarthy said. "I think Seager got mad and decided to hit some balls out."	Seager hit a trio of homers in a game for the second time in his career, leading a five-homer attack for the Dodgers in a 12-0 win over the New York Mets for their fifth consecutive victory.	The Dodgers have hit nine home runs the past two nights against the Mets. Bellinger, who hit two on Monday, hit his 22nd of the season Tuesday -- all in just 52 games. He has 10 homers over his past 10 games.	"We're having a great time," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. "As much as we're excited for Cody, we're playing very good baseball and ready to go tomorrow."	Seager finished with six RBI and has 12 home runs. Over his last 10 games, he is hitting .415 with four home runs, 13 RBI and five doubles.	"Hitting is contagious," Seager said. "Everyone's starting to roll. When one guy starts going -- a guy like Bellinger comes in -- everyone's excited, everyone wants to get on base, everyone wants to be the guy."	McCarthy (6-3) pitched four-hit ball through six innings for Los Angeles. He walked one, struck out four and lowered his ERA to 2.87. Brock Stewart got his first career save with three hitless innings in his first outing of the season.	"He's just been on the attack," Roberts said of McCarthy. "Outside of a few pitches that he yanked on the glove side, he was really good. His whole mix was on tonight, and he was filling up the strike zone."	Yasmani Grandal added a solo home run for the Dodgers, his seventh homer of the season.	Rookie Robert Gsellman (5-5) gave up four homers and eight runs over 4 1/3 innings. For the second consecutive night, the Mets fell behind 4-0 in the first inning.	"It's tough for me to sit here night after night, look up, and we're just not making pitches," Mets manager Terry Collins said. "If you're going to battle, you've got to make pitches."	MORE SEAGER	Seager also hit three home runs on June 3, 2016, against Atlanta. Mookie Betts, Juan Gonzalez and Boog Powell are the only other players in major league history with a pair of three-homer games before their 24th birthday.	Older brother Kyle Seager hit a game-ending double in the 10th inning for the Seattle Mariners in a 5-4 win over the Detroit Tigers later Tuesday night.	TOUGH HOMECOMING	Gsellman is a Los Angeles area native who was making his first career start in front of his family and friends. Said Collins: "I understand Robert being a little geeked out tonight, with the fact that it's his first game back in his hometown. First time in the big leagues to pitch in front of his family. But it's about making pitches, it's about execution. That's what the game's all for."	SIX ALL-STARS	Roberts believes he has six players deserving of All-Star recognition -- Clayton Kershaw, Kenley Jansen, Justin Turner, Seager, Bellinger and Grandal. Said Roberts: "I'm biased, but it's a no-brainer to me."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: INF Wilmer Flores was out of the lineup, but not for medical reasons. Said Collins: "You can kind of see he's dragging a little bit. So we're going to let him get off his feet for a while." Flores has been starting regularly this month, but after hitting .412 in June's first nine games, he's hit only .071 in its last eight games. ... Asdrubal Cabrera (thumb) had two singles and an RBI while playing seven innings at shortstop for Class A St. Lucie.	Dodgers: Have used the disabled list 26 times this season, but for the first time year did not offer a medical update Tuesday. They still have six on the DL, but none close to returning.	UP NEXT	Mets: Rookie RHP Tyler Pill (0-2) is scheduled to make his third career start. A Los Angeles area native, he allowed five runs (three earned) and eight hits in five innings against Pittsburgh in his previous start.	Dodgers: Struggling LHP Rich Hill (3-3) will attempt to get his season back on track Wednesday. A frustrated Hill gave up seven runs, eight hits and two walks in four innings during his last start against the Indians. He has failed to pitch more than five innings in any of his previous eight starts.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  George Springer has developed into a powerful tone-setter for the Houston Astros.	Springer's eighth leadoff homer of the season sparked a five-run first inning and the Astros once again made themselves at home in Oakland with an 8-4 victory over the Athletics on Tuesday night.	"We're wowed by him because he's setting such a great tone at the top of the order and doing it with a lot of power," Houston manager A.J. Hinch said. "The first at-bat of the game you have to be ready. He's kind of must-see TV at the top of the order."	Brian McCann and Yuli Gurriel each added an RBI double, and Alex Bregman hit a two-run single in the first against Sonny Gray (2-3) to give the Astros their eighth straight win at the Coliseum and 13th in the last 14 meetings with the A's overall.	Francis Martes (2-0) was the beneficiary of the early outburst and won his second straight start to begin his career. Houston's heralded prospect allowed three runs and six hits in 5 2/3 innings.	Chad Pinder hit a solo homer and Khris Davis and Jaycob Brugman added RBI hits for the A's, who cut the deficit to one but couldn't climb out of the early hole.	"We kept going and found some good at-bats and scored some runs, got ourselves back in the game," manager Bob Melvin said. "We're an at-bat away from tying the game."	Carlos Correa gave the Astros some insurance with a two-run single in the eighth, and Carlos Beltran added a solo homer in the ninth.	Martes got plenty of support from his hitters, most notably Springer, who homered for the third straight game to give him 21 this year. Springer hit a 3-1 pitch from Gray over the wall in left field, tying the franchise record for leadoff homers in a season held by Craig Biggio (2001) and Springer (last season).	Springer is five shy of the major league record set by Alfonso Soriano in 2003.	"I don't look into stuff like that," he said. "I just try to hit the ball hard and help the team. I'm hitting first and whatever happens, happens. I guess it's cool."	The next two Astros reached before Gray got Correa to hit into a double play. Gray struggled to get that third out, though, allowing three hits, one walk and a batter to reach on an error before finally escaping the inning.	"I just kind of got behind in some counts, threw some two-strike pitches that maybe caught too much of the plate," Gray said. "In the first, I kind of got away from the game plan a little bit and started to leave some balls kind of over the middle more."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: Josh Reddick was activated off the concussion disabled list and started in left field. He had two hits, a walk and a run scored. ... RHP Lance McCullers Jr. (lower back) is scheduled to come off the DL and start Saturday at Seattle.	Athletics: 3B Matt Chapman sat out for a second straight day with a left knee infection but could be back on the field Thursday.	ROUGH FIRST	Gray had been a fast starter this season, allowing just two total runs in the first two innings of his initial nine starts. That all changed with a five-run first against the Astros that was the worst opening inning in Gray's 106 career starts. He settled down after that and didn't allow another run before leaving after five innings.	WELCOME TO THE MAJORS	A's reliever Michael Brady made his major league debut in the ninth and got a rude greeting when Beltran homered to lead off the inning.	UP NEXT	Houston RHP Mike Fiers (4-2) looks to win his seventh straight decision on the road. Oakland LHP Sean Manaea (6-3) has won five consecutive decisions overall, with a 2.84 ERA in those six starts.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

SEATTLE --  Kyle Seager couldn't let his brother get all the attention in the family on Tuesday night, even if he had to acknowledge the younger Seager probably had the better game.	"That's a tough day to match," Seager said of his brother Corey's three home runs for the Los Angeles Dodgers. "I think I'm going to give him the edge today."	Seager had his own noteworthy moment with a game-winning RBI double to score Tyler Smith and give the Seattle Mariners a 5-4 win over the Detroit Tigers in 10 innings. Seager's one-hop shot off the right-field wall didn't quite match the three homers by his brother. But the hit gave Seattle it's fourth walk-off win this season and came after the Mariners missed chances with runners in scoring position in the eighth and ninth.	"I've been feeling pretty good. Sometimes you're feeling good and don't get many hits," Seager said. "Certainly doubles are good. I like those."	The rally in the 10th didn't take much. Nelson Cruz walked on a 3-2 pitch from Justin Wilson (3-3) to open the inning. Smith came on as a pinch runner and reached second with no outs on a wild pitch. Seager then turned on a fastball and lined it over the head of right fielder J.D. Martinez, allowing Smith to score easily.	"He got in a good count against a really good left-handed pitcher. That was the pitch he needed to get on and he didn't miss it," Seattle manager Scott Servais said.	Steve Cishek (1-1) pitched the top of the 10th to get the victory.	It was a game dominated by home runs, including Ian Kinsler's 44th career leadoff homer on the third pitch of the game. Kinsler is tied with Brady Anderson for fifth all-time in leadoff homers. Justin Upton and J.D. Martinez also went deep for the Tigers, while Taylor Motter and Ben Gamel each had solo shots for Seattle. Cruz also had a two-run double.	Seattle held a 4-2 lead going to the eighth when one of those homers pulled Detroit even against reliever Dan Altavilla. With two outs, Kinsler scored from second base on a pitch in the dirt that bounced away from catcher Mike Zunino. Kinsler was stealing on the play and never stopped after rounding third. Martinez followed with his 12th home run to tie it 4-all.	It was just the fifth time in 24 games this season Detroit has lost when hitting at least two home runs.	STARTING OFF	Ariel Miranda threw seven strong innings and was in line for his seventh win until Altavilla faltered in the eighth. Miranda allowed just four hits and none after Martinez's two-out single in the third, retiring 13 of the final 14 batters he faced.	The streak was snapped only by Seager's fielding error at third base with one out in the seventh. Miranda finished seven innings for the fourth time in 15 starts and rebounded after getting knocked around for 10 hits and six earned runs in his previous outing against Minnesota.	Almost as good was Detroit starter Jordan Zimmermann, who threw 6 2/3 innings allowing three runs and striking out seven.	"Basically the whole game I had to battle," Zimmermann said. "It seemed like the first guy got on every inning and I had to work out of a lot of trouble. Getting toward the end I was pretty gassed. ... I didn't have my best stuff tonight. I was happy to go 6 2/3."	TIP THE CAP	Gamel had the best at-bat of the night in the seventh against reliever Daniel Strumpf. Gamel fell behind 0-2, fouled off four straight pitches at 2-2 and on the ninth pitch lined his third homer of the season.	"He fouled off a bunch of pitches. He ended up the home run, which obviously I don't like, but sometimes you got to give the hitter credit," Detroit manager Brad Ausmus said.	REHAB UPDATE	Servais said Hisashi Iwakuma will need at least one more rehab start before rejoining the rotation. Iwakuma lasted just two innings Monday night at Triple-A Tacoma. He was originally scheduled to return Saturday against Houston, but that start will now likely go to Christian Bergman or Sam Gaviglio. Servais hopes shortstop Jean Segura will be able to return from a high ankle sprain by this weekend, possibly as early as Thursday.	UP NEXT	Tigers: RHP Justin Verlander (4-4) will be looking for his first decision in four starts. He allowed two runs over seven innings in his last start against Tampa Bay.	Mariners: James Paxton (5-2) tries to snap a two-game skid. Paxton was battered for seven runs over 3 2/3 innings in his last start against Texas.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

MIAMI -- When Max Scherzer's bid for the third no-hitter of his big league career ended with an infield single in the eighth inning, he picked up the ball and flung it toward his dugout.	Not as a souvenir. Seven innings of dominance followed by an eighth-inning disaster left Scherzer in no mood for keepsakes.	Backup catcher A.J. Ellis beat out a chopper for the first hit off Scherzer, who then gave up two unearned runs as the Miami Marlins rallied to beat the Washington Nationals 2-1 Wednesday.	After Ellis reached, Scherzer tried to gather himself as pitching coach Mike Maddux visited the mound.	"Those type of plays happen," Scherzer said. "Obviously you're frustrated, but you've got to move on. I hit the reset button. We went through how we wanted to finish, and I just wasn't able to do it.	An error by backup first baseman Adam Lind, who bobbled a low throw, and a hit batter loaded the bases with two outs. Scherzer threw a wild pitch that scored the tying run , and Giancarlo Stanton lined an RBI single -- the Marlins' only other hit -- to put them ahead.	"A couple of sliders got away from me," Scherzer said. "That's what cost me. That's what lost the game."	Scherzer (8-5) threw no-hitters against the Pirates and Mets in 2015, and a third seemed in his grasp when he began the eighth with a 1-0 lead.	He retired 18 in a row before Ellis topped a high-hopper that bounced in front of the plate and glanced off the tip of Scherzer's glove as he reached overhead for it. The ball rolled to shortstop Trea Turner, who failed in his attempt to make a barehanded pickup and rush a throw.	Scherzer said the chopper was nearly a routine 1-3 putout.	"I was able to get a glove on it, and I thought I had caught it," Scherzer said. "When I looked at the glove, it was empty."	"A cheap infield hit," Nationals manager Dusty Baker said.	Scherzer's pitch count of 98 entering the eighth was a concern. He and Baker agreed he was still strong, but Nationals catcher Jose Lobaton wondered whether the right-handed workhorse could finish.	"He was running out of gas," Lobaton said.	Scherzer ended up at 121 pitches, one less than his high in three seasons with the Nationals.	"It was his game," Baker said. "He was still throwing the ball great. Who could you bring in who was throwing better than him?"	The Marlins pitched well, too, and Washington totaled only five hits against Dan Straily and three relievers. Kyle Barraclough (3-1) pitched the eighth, and A.J. Ramos worked around a two-out single in the ninth for his 10th save.	Miami took the three-game series against the NL East leaders, winning twice by a single run.	"All you need is a little blooper or a hit like Ellis got to get us started," Stanton said. "It worked out for us."	The only no-hitter in the majors this year was achieved on the same mound by Miami's Edinson Volquez against Arizona on June 3.	The crowd of 22,659 for the 12:10 p.m. start included thousands of youngsters on camp day, and they gave the game a scream-filled soundtrack.	The score was 0-0 until Ryan Raburn hit his first homer of the year in the fifth. Raburn was a late replacement for outfielder Michael A. Taylor, who was scratched because of soreness.	That was the lone run allowed by Straily, who went six innings.	Scherzer walked Christian Yelich with two out in the first and hit Derek Dietrich with a pitch with one out in the second. That was the last baserunner Scherzer allowed until the eighth.	"It stinks that we lost," Raburn said, "but he pitched his tail off."	Scherzer has held the opposition hitless through five innings in 11 of his 82 starts for Washington.	"That was probably the best I've seen him," Stanton said. "Balls were zooming. He was mixing his fastball and slider speeds and angles."	MAX STATS	Scherzer had 11 strikeouts, reaching double figures for the sixth game in a row, the team's longest such streak such the franchise moved to Washington for the 2005 season.	He lowered his ERA to 2.08, best in the NL. He also leads the league with 145 strikeouts.	HEART OF THE ORDER MISSING	The Nationals' Ryan Zimmerman and Daniel Murphy, who rank 1-2 in the NL in batting, were given the afternoon game off. Bryce Harper went 0 for 4, ending his career-best 13-game hitting streak.	INJURED BROADCASTER	Marlins Spanish-language announcer Rafael "Felo" Ramirez is back in Miami following a lengthy hospital stay in Philadelphia after he fell stepping off the team bus. Ramirez, who has called games since the team's inaugural 1993 season, turns 94 Thursday.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: Baker declined to elaborate on Taylor's ailment. ... 3B Anthony Rendon (sore neck) was back in the lineup after missing two games.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  This dash to third base was a bit different for Mallex Smith.	The Tampa Bay left fielder rushed in to tag out speedy Billy Hamilton after a lengthy rundown, highlighting the Rays' 8-3 win over the Cincinnati Reds on Wednesday.	"When you get the fast guy like that, you've got to bring our fast guy and run him down," Rays right fielder Steven Souza Jr. said.	Hamilton stole his major league-leading 31st base in the fourth inning. But he later got trapped when he thought about scoring from second base on a two-out grounder by Eugenio Suarez that shortstop Daniel Robertson bobbled.	It took five throws to nab Hamilton between home and third, with six Rays lined up ready to take part in the rundown. Smith hurried from the outfield and was stationed at third to take a throw and tag Hamilton.	"Who knew he could play infield?" Souza said.	According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Smith was the first left fielder to make a rundown putout since Milwaukee's Ryan Braun on April 8, 2016, on Houston's Carlos Gomez after four throws on a stolen base attempt.	Smith singled twice, extending his hitting streak to 12 games. The string has taken place since he was recalled from Triple-A Durham on June 9 to replace Gold Glove center fielder Kevin Kiermaier, out with a broken right hip.	"He's ignited our offense," Rays manager Kevin Cash said.	"He creates havoc," Souza added.	Trevor Plouffe homered for his new team and Taylor Featherston also connected for Tampa Bay. Souza and Logan Morrison each drove in two runs.	The Rays also cost themselves on the bases. Plouffe and Featherston both were thrown out at third attempting to advance on hits, and Souza was picked off second.	"We overcome some mistakes, obviously," Cash said.	Erasmo Ramirez (4-2), who was 0-2 with a 10.06 ERA over his previous four starts, held the Reds hitless until Scott Schebler launched his 20th home run leading off the fifth.	Schebler added an RBI single in the sixth. Cincinnati dropped the final two games of the series after winning the opener to stop a nine-game skid.	"It's extremely disappointing," Reds manager Bryan Price said. "It would have been a good feel to not just break a losing streak but to win a series."	Chase Whitley entered with the bases loaded and one out in the eighth, and worked out of the jam. He pitched the ninth to get his second save.	Plouffe was cut by Oakland last week. He hit a solo homer in a two-run fourth off Tim Adleman (4-4) that put Tampa Bay up 3-0.	"First impressions go a long way, and this park didn't leave a good one," Adleman said of Tropicana Field. "That's tough to have a white roof when you play with a white ball, and catwalks everywhere. That doesn't seem like a major league baseball game."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: RHP Homer Bailey (right elbow) will return to start Saturday at Washington.	Rays: OF Colby Rasmus sat out because of hip soreness. He missed the first month of the season recovering from hip surgery. ... SS Tim Beckham, hit by a pitch on the left hand Monday, didn't play.	GETTING A BREAK	Rays 3B Evan Longoria, mired in a 2-for-19 slide, was rested.	LEGO LEAGUE	Lego artist Nathan Sawaya threw the ceremonial first pitch with a baseball he made out of Legos.	SPECIAL STRETCH	Reds 1B Joey Votto walked three times and has reached base safely in 21 straight games. He also had a 27-game on-base stretch earlier this season.	UP NEXT	Reds: RHP Luis Castillo will be called up from Double-A Pensacola to make his major league debut Friday night against Washington RHP Stephen Strasburg (8-2).	Rays: RHP Chris Archer (5-4) looks to improve on his 3-7 record and 4.69 ERA against Baltimore in the opener of a three-games series with Orioles on Friday night.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Salvador Perez borrowed a Miguel Cabrera bat from Kansas City Royals teammate Drew Butera for the first time Wednesday.	"It's a magic stick," Butera said.	It was magic for Perez, who hit his first career grand slam, connecting in the eighth inning to rally the Royals over the Boston Red Sox 6-4.	"Miggy gave the bat to Butera when Detroit was playing here," Perez said. "Drew doesn't use it. It's too heavy for him. Today, coming into the clubhouse, I put it in my locker. I like the bat.	"Today was the first day I used it and I'll use it Friday, too, before you ask me. I don't want to break that one. I've got to call Miggy and say, `You've got to send me some more bats."	The Royals have won nine of 11 and moved within a game of .500.	Perez homered over the Kansas City bullpen in left field on the ninth pitch from Robby Scott (0-1). With Boston leading 4-2, reliever Matt Barnes started the inning by walking Jorge Bonifacio and Lorenzo Cain on 12 pitches.	"We uncharacteristically lost the strike zone," Red Sox manager John Farrell said. "For a group that has been so good at not issuing too many walks over the course of the year, we had an inning that got away from us. Matt was up in the zone. He couldn't get the ball down.	"This one stings because that group has been so good, so consistent for the better part of the whole season."	Scott was summoned to face Eric Hosmer, but walked him on four pitches to load the bases for Perez. The All-Star catcher fouled off three full-count deliveries before hitting his 15th home run of the season.	"I was happy with where the pitch was, but it was too good," Scott said. "There's not much else to say about it."	According to ESPN Stats and Information, Perez was the first Kansas City player to hit a grand slam in the eighth inning or later with the Royals trailing since Frank White in 1986. Perez went 3 for 3 in the win.	Jorge Soria (3-2) worked a spotless eighth. Kelvin Herrera pitched the ninth for his 17th save in 19 chances.	Andrew Benintendi and Xander Bogaerts hit successive home runs in the Boston fourth off Ian Kennedy.	Benintendi's drive was estimated at 454 feet and landed in the right-center waterfall. The leadoff homer was Boston's first hit, and the 100th of Benintendi's career.	Five pitches later, Bogaerts went deep to left, tying the score at 2. It was the fourth time this season the Red Sox have hit back-to-back home runs.	"I tried to go inside and the ball just ran back over," Kennedy said of the homers.	Red Sox lefty Drew Pomeranz worked 6 1/3 innings, allowing two runs and six hits.	Kennedy was removed after 4 2/3 innings, giving up four runs, two earned, three hits and three walks. He has just one victory in his past 17 starts.	Errors by Kennedy and first baseman Cheslor Cuthbert helped Boston score twice in the fifth.	ORTIZ'S CEREMONY	The Red Sox will retire David Ortiz's No. 34 in a pregame ceremony Friday at Fenway Park. "When you consider the careers that are on that fa�ade, the numbers that are up there and the fact that his being done so soon after retiring, I think speaks volumes," Farrell said. "What he's meant to the city, what he's meant to the organization. To see him at the ballpark, see the smile, to hear the booming voice, it will be a good day for us."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: 2B Dustin Pedroia missed his third straight game with rib soreness after being hit by a pitch Sunday. "When he went down to swing in the cage, there's still some restriction," Farrell said. "Hopefully he'll be back in the lineup Friday." ... LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (right knee subluxation) will throw a 30-pitch two-inning simulated game Saturday.	Royals: RHP Nathan Karns (forearm strain) threw off a flat surface, his first time tossing since having a setback 11 days ago. ... LHP Danny Duffy (oblique strain) will throw a bullpen session Friday and could begin a minor league rehab stint next week.	UP NEXT	Red Sox: After a day off Thursday, RHP Rick Porcello will start Friday against the Angels.	Royals: RHP Jakob Junis will start Friday against the Blue Jays.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

CHICAGO --  A dash of power, followed by patience at the plate, paid off for the San Diego Padres.	Erick Aybar hit a tying home run in the sixth inning, Luis Torrens walked with the bases loaded against Koji Uehara in the eighth and the Padres stopped a three-game losing streak by beating the Chicago Cubs 3-2 on Wednesday.	Torrens, a rookie who started at catcher for the second straight game for the injured Austin Hedges, took a 3-1 fastball that sailed inside with two outs to force in the go-ahead run.	"It's tough to get some veteran guys to do that," manager Andy Green said. "Sometimes they want to win the game so bad swinging the bat that they don't realize the walk is just as powerful in that situation."	Uehara (2-4), the fifth of six Cubs relievers, replaced Pedro Strop starting the eighth and allowed singles to Wil Myers leading off and Cory Spangenberg with one out.	Aybar was intentionally walked, loading the bases, Matt Szczur fouled out and then the 21-year-old Torrens walked.	"I think always focusing on little things, focusing on work and making adjustments," Torrens said through a translator.	Jose Pirela started the comeback with an RBI single in the fifth off Eddie Butler, and Aybar tied the score against Brian Duensing.	Chicago rookie Ian Happ hit a two-run homer in the fourth against reliever Craig Stammen, going deep for the second straight game and third time in four. Happ is hitting just .221, but has gone deep 10 times.	"I feel like the at-bats are getting better," Happ said. "You're seeing some balls go out of the yard and hopefully if I keep making contact, some more will fall."	Phil Maton (1-0), the third of five Padres relievers, pitched a scoreless seventh for his first major league win. Brandon Maurer got two outs for his 13th save in 15 chances.	Maton, a 24-year-old from Chatham, Illinois, was delighted with where he got the victory.	"Real cool" Maton said. "Growing up in central Illinois, all the Cubs fans lived in the area. Especially this awesome atmosphere, hard to beat it."	Miguel Diaz, making his third major league start, left with one out in the third inning because of a right forearm strain. He allowed one hit and a walk, then was replaced by Stammen.	Cubs starter Eddie Butler gave up one run, five hits and three walks in four-plus innings, leaving after Stammen doubled leading off the fifth and scored on Pirella's single.	Chicago's Anthony Rizzo went 0 for 4, stopping a career-high 14-game hitting streak. He failed to reach base in his opening at-bat for the first time since being moved the leadoff spot eight games earlier.	FACEOFF	Nolan Patrick, a projected No. 1 pick on Friday at the NHL draft, threw out the ceremonial first pitch. He was joined two other top prospects, Casey Mittelstadt and Gabriel Vilardi, in a pregame ceremony.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: Green expects Diaz to miss his next start. He said the right-hander was "experiencing tightness" and "having some trouble spinning the baseball."  . 2B Yangervis Solarte (strained left oblique) is "probably a day away from heading to the DL," Green said before the game. The cleanup hitter was removed from Tuesday's game in the first inning. ... Hedges (bruised thigh), hit hard by Rizzo in a collision at the plate on Monday, was available to pinch hit but did not play.	Cubs: OF/C Kyle Schwarber went 0 for 3, dropping his average to .171. He missed Tuesday's game, a day after fouling a pitch off his right ankle on Monday. ... OF Jason Heyward missed his third game after scraping his left hand sliding in an attempt to catch a foul ball on Sunday.	UP NEXT	Padres: Rookie RHP Dinelson Lamet (2-2, 7.50) starts Friday's homestand opener against Detroit and RHP Michael Fulmer (6-5, 3.45), the AL Rookie of the Year. Lamet struck out 12 at Milwaukee on Saturday.	Cubs: RHP Jake Arrieta (6-5, 4.64) is to open an 11-game tip Friday at Miami, which starts LHP Jeff Locke (0-2, 4.58). Arrieta has failed to finish the fifth inning in his last two starts, allowing seven runs, nine hits and five walks in nine innings.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BALTIMORE --  The Cleveland Indians and Baltimore Orioles can smash the ball. Both teams play sound defense, and each has a veteran manager in the dugout.	So, when it comes down to explaining why the Indians lead the AL Central and the Orioles are sinking toward the bottom of the AL East, only one word is necessary: pitching.	Carlos Carrasco struck out 10 , Francisco Lindor homered and the Indians defeated the skidding Orioles 5-1 Wednesday night for their seventh win in eight games.	Carrasco (8-3) allowed seven hits and walked none over six-plus innings to win his third straight start. The right-hander struck out every Baltimore starter except Trey Mancini to reach double figures for the 11th time in his career.	Cleveland held a 3-0 lead when Carrasco yielded three straight singles to open the seventh. Andrew Miller entered and got a force at the plate before striking out Caleb Joseph and Ruben Tejada.	"That's the ballgame," Indians manager Terry Francona said. "That's pretty impressive. For them to get nothing? That certainly carried the heavy lifting."	Miller said his goal was simply to "just limit the damage."	If only it was that easy for Baltimore. Not only did the Orioles lose for the 10th time in 14 games, but they have allowed at least five runs in 18 consecutive games -- two short of the major league record set by the 1924 Philadelphia Phillies.	Once the Indians took control with a three-run fifth, Baltimore was all but finished.	"There wasn't much margin for error with Carrasco. He's having another good year," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. "I think that's what a lot of people miss about them is, as good of an offensive club and a defensive club as they are, their pitching was good last year and will be again this year."	Dan Otero gave up an RBI double to Jonathan Schoop in the ninth, ending Cleveland's bid for its major league-leading ninth shutout. After Baltimore put runners on the corners with two outs, Bryan Shaw retired Tejada for his second save .	Kevin Gausman (3-7) gave up three runs and six hits in 5 2/3 innings with nine strikeouts for the Orioles.	Gausman was cruising until the fifth, when the Indians peeled off four straight hits to go up 3-0. After Roberto Perez doubled in a run, Lindor followed with a two-run homer.	"It's kind of the way things have gone, really, throughout the whole season so far for me," Gausman said. "Pitching well and it kind of gets away from me."	Cleveland added two runs in the ninth against Miguel Castro.	MULTI-HIT WONDER	Cleveland's Jose Ramirez went 2 for 5, extending his steak of multihit games to nine -- matching the club record held by three other players and last accomplished in 1936. Ramirez is 23 for 42 over his last nine games.	BETTER LATE THAN POSTPONED	For the second time in three nights, the start of the game was delayed by rain. This one began 44 minutes late, and Monday's got underway 29 minutes behind schedule.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: OF Brandon Guyer was hit on the ankle by a pitch during a rehabilitation appearance with Triple-A Columbus on Tuesday, but X-rays revealed no damage. Francona said Guyer, on the disabled list since May 13 with a sprained left wrist, will return to Cleveland later this week to reconvene with team officials.	Orioles: RHP Darren O'Day (shoulder) pitched a simulated game and should come off the disabled list Friday. ... All-Star closer Zach Britton (forearm strain) felt fine after pitching a scoreless inning in his first rehab appearance Tuesday. He could come off the DL as soon as July 5. ... C Welington Castillo was given a day off with a sore shoulder. ... 1B Chris Davis (oblique) received a platelet-rich plasma injection Tuesday.	UP NEXT	Indians: RHP Mike Clevinger (2-3, 3.89 ERA) seeks his first victory in five starts when Cleveland wraps up an eight-game road trip Thursday night.	Orioles: LHP Wade Miley (3-4, 4.29 ERA) tries to get back on track after allowing 15 earned runs over 10 2/3 innings during his past three starts.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

NEW YORK --  Yankees manager Joe Girardi finally got to use the overpowering 1-2 at the back of his bullpen, getting innings from Dellin Betances and Aroldis Chapman in the same game for the first time since early May.	Of course, he would have rather not needed both Wednesday night, but that's a problem for another day.	First, to celebrate a much-needed victory.	Didi Gregorius and Matt Holliday each hit a go-ahead homer, and New York piled on from there to beat the Los Angeles Angels 8-4 and snap a season-high seven-game losing streak.	New York's skid was its longest since 2007. The Yankees haven't lost eight straight since August 1995. They moved back ahead of Boston for first place in the AL East a night after losing the division lead for the first time since mid-May.	"It's nice," Girardi said. "It's been a frustrating week, no doubt about it."	Jordan Montgomery (5-4) pitched two-run ball over 5 2/3 innings, and relievers Chad Green and Betances got the ball to Tyler Clippard in the ninth.	Clippard, pitching a night after being booed off the mound, allowed a leadoff double to Andrelton Simmons and a two-run homer to Martin Maldonado, his second of the game.	Clippard, New York's go-to seventh-inning man, has allowed at least a run in four of his past five appearances, including three in 1/3 of an inning Tuesday night.	"Trying to get him a clean inning and it didn't work," Girardi said. "He'll get back on track."	Instead, Girardi called on Chapman to close out. The hard-throwing left-hander went 1-2-3 in his second appearance since coming off the disabled list Sunday.	Montgomery pitched with an extra day of rest and gave up five hits, including a two-run homer by Maldonado, while striking out five. The left-hander is 3-1 with a 2.55 ERA over his past six starts.	Maldonado had the first multihomer game of his career. He and Andrelton Simmons each had three hits for the Angels.	Austin Romine added a two-run single for New York in the sixth. The backup catcher had three hits, and is batting.350 with 12 RBI with runners in scoring position this season.	Aaron Hicks scored Romine with a single, and Starlin Castro and Chase Headley added RBI in the seventh.	RUNS ON RICKY	Ricky Nolasco (2-9) lost his seventh consecutive start to match George Brunet's franchise record from 1967. The Angels have lost 10 straight with the right-hander on the mound.	Nolasco allowed the homers to Holliday and Gregorius, and has given up 23 long balls this season, tied for the major league lead with Cincinnati's Bronson Arroyo.	"Ricky's been a good major league starting pitcher," manager Mike Scioscia said. "And he's not that far off from being where we feel he's going to be as productive as he was towards the end of last year.	"We all feel this is really correctable with Ricky," Scioscia added.	BACK TOGETHER	Betances and Chapman hadn't pitched in the same game since Chapman blew a save against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field on May 7, a game New York won 5-4 in 18 innings.	Betances struck out two in a perfect eighth Wednesday in his first game since June 15.	BIG APPLE BIG FLIES	Gregorius lofted a two-run homer for New York down the right field line in the second inning that started the scoring. It was the eighth homer of the season for Gregorius and his second in three games.	Holliday, making his seventh start this season at first base, went the other way for a solo homer in the fifth inning that made it 3-2. It was his 15th homer.	MOVING ON	The Angels waived right-hander Doug Fister to release him from his minor league contract. The 6-foot-8 starter was 1-0 with a 4.02 ERA in three starts with Triple-A Salt Lake.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: Huston Street was set to be evaluated Wednesday. The right-hander allowed one hit over 1 1/3 innings for Salt Lake in a rehab outing Monday.	Yankees: 1B Greg Bird received a cortisone shot to address a bruised right ankle. Bird's minor league rehab assignment was cut short after he went 3 for 21 at Triple-A from June 1-14. He hasn't played for the Yankees since May 1. ... CF Jacoby Ellsbury, out since sustaining a concussion May 24, ran the bases and was set to take batting practice.	UP NEXT	Yankees RHP Luis Severino (5-2, 2.99 ERA) tries to rebound from a tough start in a matchup with Angels RHP Jesse Chavez (5-7, 4.85). Severino allowed four runs and four walks over six innings in a 7-6 loss to Oakland on June 16. He had gone seven straight starts allowing three or fewer runs.	---	Follow Jake Seiner on Twitter at https://twitter.com/jake-seiner	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

PHILADELPHIA -- The Cardinals used the long ball to rally and small ball to win.	Tommy Pham's second solo homer off Hector Neris in the ninth inning tied it and the St. Louis Cardinals came back from a 5-0 deficit to beat the Philadelphia Phillies 7-6 in 10 innings Wednesday night.	Jedd Gyorko hit a two-run homer and pinch-hitter Jose Martinez also connected for St. Louis.	"Any time you come back like that, it feels real good, shows we have a lot of character," Pham said.	The game went to extra innings after Freddy Galvis lined a double down the left-field line with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, but Odubel Herrera ran through a stop sign, around third-base coach Juan Samuel and was thrown out by 10 feet. He didn't even attempt to slide and was pulled from the game in a double switch.	"I was playing aggressive, I wanted to win the game, I put my head down and kept running," Herrera said through a translator. "I saw (the stop sign) late. It's my mistake."	Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said Herrera let his "emotions get the best of him."	Martinez led off the 10th with a double to right off Edubray Ramos (0-6). He advanced to third on a balk and scored when Ramos made a throwing error on a pickoff attempt at first base after Dexter Fowler was intentionally walked. Yadier Molina added an RBI single.	Phillies starter Nick Pivetta had a career-high 10 strikeouts and allowed three runs and four hits in six innings. The rookie right-hander fanned nine in seven scoreless innings in his previous outing against Boston -- also a no-decision. The Cardinals won their second straight extra-inning game after losing five of six.	The Phillies have lost 13 of 14 and 39 of 50. They have the worst record in the majors (22-48).	Cardinals starter Michael Wacha gave up five runs -- two earned -- and nine hits in four innings. Brett Cecil (1-2) got two outs to earn the win. Seung Hwan Oh allowed a run but finished for his 16th save in 18 tries.	The Phillies jumped ahead 3-0 in the first inning. The runs were unearned because of a fielding error by second baseman Greg Garcia.	After Garcia booted a double-play grounder, Maikel Franco drove in the first run with a fielder's choice grounder and Herrera ripped a two-run double to right-center.	Garcia made a throwing error in the fourth that allowed another run as the Phillies took a 5-0 lead.	Pham hit his eighth homer in the fifth. Gyorko went deep in the sixth for his 11th homer. Martinez hit one off Joaquin Benoit in the eighth to cut it to 5-4. Pham drove one out to straightaway center to tie it in the ninth.	"He's a dangerous hitter to any part of the field," Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said of Pham. "An exciting player."	GOING DEEP	The Cardinals have hit three or more homers in five consecutive games. They have 19 homers since June 16.	FREE BASEBALL	The Phillies have played three straight extra-inning games and 11 this season, going 4-7.	SIGNED AND READY	Outfielder Adam Haseley, selected eighth overall in last week's amateur draft, agreed to a minor league contract with the Phillies that includes a $5.1 million signing bonus.	The 21-year-old, a left-handed hitter, batted .390 with 14 homers and 56 RBI in 58 games at Virginia this year. Haseley could begin his pro career at Single-A Clearwater.	"Wherever they want me to go," Haseley said. "I'm just looking forward to getting going."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: CF Fowler left the game with left quad tightness after scoring from second base on a single for the seventh run.	UP NEXT	Cardinals: RHP Carlos Martinez (6-5, 2.86 ERA) starts the series finale Thursday afternoon. He's 3-0 with 20 strikeouts in 23 innings in three starts vs. the Philadelphia.

ATLANTA --  The Braves are making a habit of winning games in their last at-bat. They've done it more than any team in the majors.	Matt Kemp hit a two-run homer off Cory Gearrin in the 11th inning to lift Atlanta to a 5-3 win over the San Francisco Giants on Wednesday night.	The homer, the third of the game for Atlanta, was Kemp's seventh game-ending shot of his career.	Matt Adams hit a two-run homer and Tyler Flowers also homered off Jeff Samardzija.	It was the Braves' 12th win in their final at-bat, the most in the majors.	"Like I keep saying, they never quit," said Braves manager Brian Snitker. "They just grind through games. They keep coming at you."	Gearrin (1-2) walked Nick Markakis with one out before Kemp's homer barely cleared the right field wall. He found a circle of teammates waiting to celebrate at home plate.	Braves Sean Newcomb, who gave up one run in six innings, was denied his first win when Hunter Pence's homer off Braves closer Jim Johnson tied the game at 3-3 in the ninth. It was Johnson's fifth blown save in 18 chances.	Luke Jackson (2-0) pitched the 11th for the win.	The Giants, who snapped a seven-game losing streak by beating the Braves 6-3 on Tuesday night, have lost 10 of 12. They have not won two straight road games since May 19-20 at St. Louis and they fell to 1-6 on their eight-game road trip.	"It's another tough loss for us," said Giants manager Bruce Bochy. "It's our third comeback on the road trip and we've lost them all."	Adams has flourished in what was intended to be a fill-in role at first base while Freddie Freeman recovered from a fractured left wrist. Freeman said Wednesday he plans to play third base when healthy to keep Adams' bat in the lineup.	Brandon Belt's triple into the right-field corner off Newcomb drove in Pence for a 1-0 lead in the second.	Denard Span tripled off Arodys Vizcaino with one out in the eighth and scored on Vizcaino's wild pitch to Brandon Crawford.	Newcomb retired his final 13 batters and allowed one run on three hits in six innings. He was pulled after throwing 80 pitches.	"I understood," Newcomb said. "There were some righties coming up I had already seen two or three times."	Samardzija allowed three runs on six hits in seven innings. He had eight strikeouts.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Giants: A MRI revealed inflammation in 3B Eduardo Nunez's left hamstring. He will test the hamstring on the field on Friday in San Francisco and could land on the DL if there is no improvement. He has tried to play through hamstring discomfort most of the season and has missed four of the last five games.  ... LHP Madison Bumgarner (left shoulder) threw 35 pitches over two innings in his second simulated game. He is scheduled to throw three innings in a rookie league game on Sunday.	Braves: Freeman (fractured left wrist) hopes to be cleared to hit following a CT scan on Friday. Freeman took grounders at third base and said he is targeting July 14 against Arizona as his first game off the DL.	WET NIGHT	The start of the game was delayed by rain. There is more rain in the forecast for Thursday night's final game of the series.	SAVED BY THE REVIEW	Flowers' homer bounced off the top of the wall into the netting attached to the left field foul pole and bounced back to left fielder Austin Slater. A review confirmed the homer.	Flowers was grateful for the ruling, because he was standing on first base watching the ball.	"Thank goodness it went out," Flowers said. "Not so much that it was a homer, but not to end up with a single and be embarrassed by that.	TOP DRAFT PICKS SIGN	The Braves have signed their first 24 draft picks, including right-hander Kyle Wright, the No. 5 overall selection. The team also signed OF Drew Waters, the No. 41 overall pick.	UP NEXT	Giants: RHP Matt Cain (3-6, 4.99) is 4-3 with a 3.16 ERA in nine career starts against Atlanta. He was the losing pitcher despite allowing only one run in seven innings in a 2-0 loss to the Braves on May 26 in San Francisco.	Braves: LHP Jaime Garcia (2-5, 3.59) pitched 6 2/3 innings in the 2-0 win over the Giants on May 26. For his career, he is 4-1 with a 2.54 ERA against San Francisco.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Darwin Barney's two-run homer capped a big first inning and was just enough for the Toronto Blue Jays to earn a victory -- and again get within one game of their first .500 record this season.	Still, the shot by Barney over the left-field wall that capped a quick six-run outburst in a 7-5 win Wednesday night wasn't quite as exciting as Rangers slugger Joey Gallo's drive that ricocheted off of it for an inside-the-park homer.	"It went up, I looked back to find the wall and when I looked back to find the ball again I had no idea where it was," said Blue Jays left fielder Steve Pearce, who crashed hard into the wall trying to make the play -- and left the game an inning later with a bruised right knee.	Ryan Goins drove in three runs for Toronto, including a two-run double in the first that preceded Barney's homer off Tyson Ross . Barney was 4 for 40 in his previous 15 games.	In the series finale Thursday, Toronto (35-36) will try for the ninth time this season to get to .500.	Gallo's 19th homer, an opposite-field shot leading off the fifth, was among his career-high three extra-base hits -- he also had two doubles and scored three runs. The 6-foot-5, 230-pound slugger was 6 for 50 over his previous 14 games before a night off Tuesday.	"As soon as it hit the wall and he went down, I thought I might have a chance at scoring. It was pretty exciting," Gallo said.	"Day down I think freshened him up a little bit," Rangers manager Jeff Banister said. "It's always fun to watch a big man like that run around the bases. ... It's fun to watch when this guy is swinging the bat well."	Joe Biagini (2-6) struck out five in 5 2/3 innings for his first win in seven starts since May 12.	Roberto Osuna worked the ninth for his 19th save. The right-hander has converted his last 18 chances since consecutive blown saves in late April.	Ross (1-1) threw 41 pitches in the first and allowed seven runs over three innings in only his second start since signing with Texas as a free agent in January. San Diego's opening day starter in 2016 missed the rest of the season because of right shoulder issues, then was out to start this season while recovering from surgery for thoracic outlet syndrome.	Goins' RBI groundout in the third put Toronto up 7-0, before Shin-Shoo Choo's two-run homer in the bottom of the inning.	Gallo doubled again in the sixth and scored on a two-run single by Delino DeShields, the last Texas hit.	"They just kept creeping back; we scored early," Toronto manager John Gibbons said. "We took advantage of the kid in the first."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: Pearce, who was 3 for 3 at the plate, was replaced in left field to start the sixth. "At first, when the adrenaline was in there, I thought I could go," he said. ... RHP Leonel Campos was put on the 10-day disabled list, a day after he strained his right groin covering first base. The Blue Jays' 12 players on the DL match Tampa Bay for most in the majors.	Rangers: LHP Cole Hamels (right oblique strain) threw 81 pitches in 5 2/3 innings for Double-A Frisco and could return to the Texas rotation as early as next week. He's been out since late April.	SHORT HOPS	Jose Bautista made his Blue Jays-record 857th career start in right field, breaking a tie with Jesse Barfield. ... Choo had two hits and two walks, reaching base multiple times for the seventh game in a row and 10th time in 11 games. He has reached base in 26 of 51 plate appearances over his last 11 games.	INSIDE THE PARK	The Rangers have 26 inside-the-park homers in their history. Gallo's was only the fourth at home in 24 seasons in their current ballpark.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays: The Blue Jays are 0-8 when attempting to even their record, including a 6-1 loss Tuesday night, and have been outscored 62-20 in those defeats.	Rangers: Texas wraps up a seven-game homestand before playing 20 of its next 26 games on the road. The Rangers have lost eight of their last 12 at home.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

MILWAUKEE --  Domingo Santana delivered the blow that put the Milwaukee Brewers ahead on the scoreboard. Orlando Arcia came up with the play that saved the game.	With the tying run on second and two outs in the ninth, Arcia ranged to his left, spun around and delivered a strike to first base to secure a 4-3 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Wednesday night.	"It is a really tough play in that situation," Arcia said through a translator. "You just try to make a perfect throw. You don't want the ball to get away and have the run score. You just try to make as perfect of a throw as you can. Thankfully, I was able to do that."	Pirates left fielder Adam Frazier was rounding third base when Arcia threw the ball and likely would have scored if first baseman Eric Thames had not made a difficult pick.	"I was yelling, `Don't throw it," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. "To myself, that's what I was thinking. That's his play, for sure. It took a great play on Thames' end too. It is a special play in a big moment."	Thames cut Pittsburgh's lead to 3-2 with a run-scoring groundout in the seventh. Two batters later, Santana kept a 2-0 offering from Hudson (1-3) just fair down the right-field line to give the Brewers the lead.	"Off the bat, I thought it might go foul," Hudson said. "It just stayed fair. He did a good job. He did a good job of sitting on it and shooting it that way."	Oliver Drake (3-2) received the win after pitching a scoreless seventh. Jacob Barnes struck out the side in the eighth and Corey Knebel recorded his 11th save with the help from Arcia in the ninth.	Pittsburgh took a 1-0 lead in the third on consecutive doubles by Adam Frazier and Josh Harrison. The Brewers answered in the bottom half on a two-out RBI single by Santana.	John Jaso put Pittsburgh in front in the fifth with a two-out double that scored Frazier. Josh Bell made it 3-1 in the sixth with a solo shot off Brewers starter Junior Guerra.	Guerra used six strikeouts to help limit damage to just three runs despite issuing five walks and allowing seven hits over six innings.	Williams recorded back-to-back strikeouts to end the sixth but immediately ran into trouble in the seventh. Keon Broxton led off with a single and Arcia followed with a double down the left-field line.	Reliever Tony Watson came on to get Thames to bounce into a run-scoring groundout and then struck out Eric Sogard before giving way to Hudson to face Santana.	Williams finished with a career-high seven strikeouts and worked into the seventh inning for just the second time in nine starts this season.	STILL STREAKING	With a strikeout of Harrison in the ninth, Knebel extended his streak of consecutive appearances with at least one strikeout to 37, matching Aroldis Chapman for the modern era record (since 1900) by a reliever to begin a season.	"That's an impressive streak, certainly," Counsell said. "You mention a guy like Aroldis Chapman, you take notice. That's incredible. It really is. It is a worthy streak that should be talked about."	IN THE FOLD	The Brewers introduced first-round draft pick Keston Hiura in a news conference at Miller Park on Wednesday. Hiura signed his contract and then took batting practice on the field before the game.	It was believed that Hiura would need surgery to correct an elbow injury that prevented him from playing the field at UC-Irvine this season. However, Brewers director of amateur scouting Tod Johnson said team doctors feel surgery is not necessary and cleared Hiura to begin a throwing program at rookie level Arizona.	Hiura, picked ninth overall, will begin in rookie ball with the expectation of advancing to Class-A Wisconsin before the end of the season.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: C Francisco Cervelli was out of the lineup for the second straight game. He sat out Tuesday due to flu-like symptoms and was scheduled to have the day off Wednesday.	Brewers: INF Jonathan Villar (lower back strain) and OF Ryan Braun (strained left calf) will begin minor-league rehabilitation assignments Thursday with Class-A Wisconsin. The two will play through the weekend with the Timber Rattlers and potentially could be activated Tuesday before Milwaukee's three-game series in Cincinnati, according to Counsell. ... RHP Wily Peralta was placed on the 10-day DL with a right calf strain. LHP Brent Suter was recalled from Triple-A Colorado Springs.	UP NEXT	Pirates: RHP Ivan Nova (7-4, 2.91 ERA) will start the series finale on Thursday afternoon. He has pitched at least six innings in each of his first 14 starts. Nova is 1-0 with a 2.25 ERA in two career starts against Milwaukee.	Brewers: RHP Chase Anderson (5-2, 2.92 ERA) will look to continue his run of success, as he is 10-3 with a 2.77 ERA over his last 26 starts dating to July 25, 2016. Anderson had a 2.16 ERA in five starts against Pittsburgh in 2016.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

MINNEAPOLIS --  The Minnesota Twins struggled so badly last season that even the elite talents of Jose Berrios and Miguel Sano were swallowed up by a club-record 103 losses.	Their skills have sure been shining through this year.	Berrios finished eight innings for a second straight start and Sano homered for the second consecutive game as the Twins beat the Chicago White Sox 4-2 on Wednesday night behind two of their brightest young stars.	After going 3-7 with an unsightly 8.02 ERA in 14 turns as a rookie, Berrios (7-1) has a sparkling 2.67 ERA in eight starts since being recalled from Triple-A.	"There's a lot to be said about the path that he's been on. He's gone deep now a couple times when we've really needed it," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.	Berrios struck out eight with just four hits and one walk against him.	"This year, he's got a different mentality," Sano said. "I know he's working really hard, all season. He comes here to pitch."	The White Sox had one single over their last 18 at-bats against the 22-year-old right-hander.	"I'm trying to stay humble, stay down to earth, keep enjoying the moment and help the team keep competitive," Berrios said.	Sano hit his 18th home run, tying the game to start a three-run third inning off a 3-0 fastball from David Holmberg (1-1) with an opposite-field drive to the second deck in right-center . The 24-year-old Sano, on a break from third base to serve as the designated hitter, is third in the AL with 52 RBI.	He hit 25 homers in 116 games last season, but an ill-fated tryout in right field set a discouraging tone and he batted just .236. This year, he's up to .291 with a .973 on-base-plus-slugging percentage.	Brandon Kintzler pitched a scoreless ninth inning for the second straight night, notching his 19th save in 22 opportunities. The Twins (36-33) improved to 7-3 against the White Sox this season, using their last-place rival for a much-needed lift following a four-game sweep here over the weekend by division-leading Cleveland.	AL batting leader Avisail Garcia put the White Sox in front with an RBI single in the first inning, and Adam Engel came home during a groundball double play in the third inning after a leadoff double.	But Berrios was in command the whole time with a lively two-seam fastball doing most of the damage.	"Last year, I gave a lot of credit to the hitter," Berrios said. "This year, I don't care who is hitting. So I'm trying to think about my pitches and make them."	NOT FOR LONG	Holmberg lasted only 3 1/3 innings, his shortest of five starts after being promoted from the bullpen. The left-hander gave up seven hits and two walks while striking out four. Two of the four runs he allowed were unearned, due to a fielding error on shortstop Tim Anderson.	Brian Dozier had an RBI double and Max Kepler added an RBI single, as they both joined Eduardo Escobar with two hits apiece. Ehire Adrianza drove in a run and had three of Minnesota's four steals.	"They were putting the ball in play hard, and they were putting pressure on the defense," Holmberg said. "I was pitching from behind in the count, and I'd rather it had been the other way."	Over their last 28 games, the White Sox have only five quality starts of six innings or more and three runs or less.	"It's not sustainable. It just isn't," manager Rick Renteria said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox: 3B Todd Frazier was on the bench and Garcia was the DH for rest, with the team having begun on Tuesday a stretch of 16 straight days with a game.	Twins: LHP Glen Perkins (shoulder strain) was diagnosed with biceps tendinitis after his latest throwing session at extended spring training and shut down for a week. ... LHP Hector Santiago (shoulder strain) and RHP Phil Hughes (shoulder weakness) pitched trouble-free rehab assignments for Triple-A Rochester. Santiago will join the Twins in Cleveland on Friday.	UP NEXT	White Sox: LHP Jose Quintana (3-8, 5.07 ERA) will take the mound on Thursday afternoon, coming off one of his best starts of what has been his worst of six major league seasons. Quintana, an All-Star in 2016, is 0-4 in his last five appearances against the Twins.	Twins: LHP Nik Turley (0-1, 12.46 ERA) will take another turn in the rotation in the series finale, despite 17 hits, four walks and 12 runs allowed over 8 2/3 innings in his first two major league starts.	---	More AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

DENVER -- Wanting to give his team a little bit of a break on a broiling day in Denver following a tough loss the night before, Arizona Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo had his players skip pregame batting practice in favor of staying inside to do individual work in the batting cages.	And when they finally took the field, they came out swinging.	Taijuan Walker pitched six solid innings and slapped an RBI single during Arizona's biggest inning ever on the road -- a 10-run fourth -- and the Diamondbacks went on to beat the Colorado Rockies 16-5 on Wednesday night.	"We pulled the guys off the field to hit in the cages to keep them rested, keep them strong," Lovullo said. "So they were ready. I know they were in here working really hard and it translated. I don't know exactly if hitting in here had something to do with the production. I just think the guys were ready for the challenge."	Shaking off Tuesday's tough loss in which Colorado rallied late for a one-run win, the Diamondbacks sent 14 men to the plate and pounded out nine hits, including a two-run double and RBI single by Brandon Drury in his two at-bats in the inning. Drury finished with four hits and a career-high six RBI and the Diamondbacks established season highs in run and hits (20).	"No game is over here in Colorado but that 10-run inning, we could kind of relax a little bit, so it was huge for the team," Drury said.	David Peralta and Paul Goldschmidt also connected for two hits in the inning and combined for three RBI, helping the Diamondbacks snap the Rockies' winning streak at six games and setting up Thursday's match between the NL West rivals as the decisive game in the series.	"I think the backbreaker was the pitcher (getting an RBI hit). From there, it sort of unraveled," Rockies manager Bud Black said.	The Los Angeles Dodgers, Rockies and Diamondbacks are all bunched at or near the top of the division and among them have best records in the NL.	Nick Ahmed added a two-run homer off reliever Carlos Estevez in the seventh. Goldschmidt collected three hits and three RBI and Peralta had four hits and an RBI.	Walker (6-3), who had eight strikeouts, allowed three runs and six hits, including a solo home run by Mark Reynolds in the second. He has not allowed more than three earned runs in any of his seven starts on the road this season and perhaps most importantly did not allow the Rockies to score after Arizona's big inning.	"I think that's the biggest thing for us pitchers, because our offense is really good, so when we score a lot of runs, as a pitcher you want to go out there and have those shutdown innings," Walker said. "I think those are the innings that win games for the team."	Jeff Hoffman (4-1) could not get out of the fourth inning in taking his first loss of the season. He allowed nine runs and eight hits in 3 2/3 innings.	"It was one of those things where I was not making good pitches and they were doing what they were supposed to do with them," Hoffman said. "I'm one to try to move on to the the next pitch. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to do that tonight."	Nolan Arenado had a two-run double for the Rockies in the fifth.	SCARY MOMENT	A seventh-inning fastball from Estevez skipped off the left hand of Chris Iannetta as he dropped to the ground and smacked into face mask of home plate umpire Andy Fletcher, knocking it askew. Fletcher and Iannetta, who was struck in the mouth by a pitch May 12 and went on the 7-day concussion disabled list, were both checked by team trainers. Iannetta, who narrowly avoided being hit in the head again, remained in the game and Fletcher finished calling the top of the seventh. But Fletcher, apparently still feeling some of the effects from taking a pitch to the head, left the game midway through the seventh and second base umpire Ron Kulpa moved behind the plate to call balls and strikes the rest of the way. In a statement released by the Rockies, officials said Fletcher was being evaluated for a concussion and would not work Thursday's finale.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: OF Yasmany Tomas, on the 10-day DL with right groin tendinitis, continues to take batting practice and engage in light running and throwing but there's still no word on when he will return.	Rockies: RHP Chad Qualls, placed on the 10-day DL because of back spasms, threw on the side Wednesday and seems on target to return in the next week. ... OF Gerardo Parra, who suffered a strained right quad earlier this month, is getting better but it remains uncertain when he'll be back. "He's doing better," Black said before the game. "He's running on the field, he's hitting. It gets a little tricky at the end, when it gets closer."	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: RHP Zack Godley (2-1, 2.34 ERA) has allowed three or fewer runs in each of his eight starts this season.	Rockies: The win total by rookie RHP Antonio Senzatela (9-2, 4.10 ERA) ranks second in the NL and he has been successful at Coors Field, where he has gone 7-1 in eight starts.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

LOS ANGELES -- Another day, another power outburst by the Los Angeles Dodgers. And the struggling New York Mets were in no mood for Yasiel Puig's antics.	Puig riled the frustrated Mets with a long look at his three-run homer, Yasmani Grandal added two solo shots and the streaking Dodgers took over first place in the NL West by battering New York pitching again for an 8-2 victory Wednesday night.	Rich Hill turned in his best five innings of the season for the Dodgers, who have won six straight and 12 of 13. They jumped a half-game ahead of Colorado, which had its six-game winning streak snapped with a 16-5 loss to Arizona.	Puig posed at home plate and admired his fourth-inning drive off rookie Tyler Pill, irritating Mets first baseman Wilmer Flores, who said something to Puig as the Cuban slugger rounded the bag.	Puig looked back at Flores as he was trotting toward second and cursed at him, Flores said.	"I just told him to run the bases, that was it," Flores said. "I don't think he knows what having respect for the game is. We're playing horrible right now, we don't need his (behavior)."	Puig claimed he did not remember the exchange.	"He disrespected us," Flores said. "I think there's a way to enjoy a home run. That was too much."	Between innings, Mets veteran Jose Reyes and outfielder Yoenis Cespedes, also from Cuba, spoke with Puig on the field.	"After I talked to Cespedes, he told me, `Try to run a little bit faster,' and tried to give me some advice," Puig said through a translator. "I don't look at it that way, but it is what it is."	It's far from the first time Puig has annoyed an opponent, but there was no obvious attempt at retaliation from the Mets.	"We've got bigger problems than somebody's home run trot right now," manager Terry Collins said.	Outscored 30-8 in the first three games of this four-game series, the banged-up Mets (31-40) have dropped six of seven overall and are nine games under .500 for the first time since Sept. 2, 2014.	They've given up 12 homers in the series, and the Dodgers have gone deep in 13 consecutive games.	"Historically, it's a moment in time you have to appreciate," Hill said.	Hill (4-3) gave up a leadoff home run to Curtis Granderson, then held the Mets scoreless for the rest of his five innings. He struck out a season-high eight and allowed four hits, but became the first pitcher in major league history to last five or fewer innings in each of his first nine starts in a season.	The Dodgers tied the score on Hill's sacrifice fly in the third, his first RBI since June 19, 2009.	They took the lead in the fourth after rookie Cody Bellinger doubled and advanced to third on right fielder Jay Bruce's throwing error. Logan Forsythe's double drove in the go-ahead run. After an intentional walk to Joc Pederson, Puig launched his 13th home run.	Grandal added his first solo shot in the sixth and second in the eighth. He has three homers in his last two games and nine on the season.	Pill went six innings, yielding six runs and five hits.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: RHP Zack Wheeler was placed on the 10-day disabled list with biceps tendinitis. The Mets are hoping Wheeler (3-5, 5.29 ERA) will only miss one start. Collins said it was undetermined who would take Wheeler's next turn.	Dodgers: Manager Dave Roberts said OF Andre Ethier, out all season with a herniated lumbar disk, is not expected back until rosters expand Sept. 1. ... LHP Julio Urias (shoulder) remains on the Triple-A disabled list. Roberts said Urias was seen by team doctor Neal ElAttrache this week and the club was still gathering information. ... Roberts said 1B Adrian Gonzalez's herniated disk pain has subsided since his epidural but Gonzalez still does not have full range of motion.	UP NEXT	Mets: LHP Steven Matz (1-1) makes his third start of the season in the series finale Thursday night. Matz went seven innings in his two previous starts after missing more than two months with a sore elbow. He has a 1.50 ERA in three career starts at Dodger Stadium.	Dodgers: LHP Hyun-Jin Ryu (3-6) is another Los Angeles starter trying to add some length to his outings. Ryu has pitched past the sixth inning just once in his last 11 starts. He did throw a season-high 105 pitches in his most recent start.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- The Houston Astros have found success stringing together hits, even just base hits. They had five singles in the decisive sixth Wednesday night.	Carlos Correa homered, Mike Fiers struck out five over six innings to win his fourth straight decision, and the majors-best Astros won for the ninth straight time in Oakland, beating the Athletics 5-1.	Evan Gattis hit a two-run single in the sixth against A's lefty Sean Manaea to break a scoreless tie and back Fiers (5-2). The right-hander also won his seventh straight road decision in his last 11 away outings for Houston (49-24).	"The five singles in an inning continues to be the theme where we can put together innings and score runs without the home run," manager A.J. Hinch said. "That impressed me that we just took what he gave us, hit the ball hard, got some good results and scored some runs."	Jake Marisnick added an RBI single in the decisive sixth inning of the Astros' 14th victory in the last 15 overall against Oakland. Marisnick added a sacrifice fly in the eighth after the A's got on the board with pinch-hitter Stephen Vogt's RBI groundout.	Correa connected for his 14th homer in the ninth against Josh Smith and also turned a couple of snazzy double plays.	"That's why our team's so dynamic," third baseman Alex Bregman said. "We've got speed, we've got power, we've got power arms."	Manaea (6-4) lost for the first time in seven starts since a May 15 defeat at Seattle. He had won five consecutive decisions overall, but is yet to beat Houston in six starts.	"They're unbelievable, one through nine, you don't catch any breaks," Manaea said.	Vogt, a catcher, played left field for the first time since July 2, 2014, at Detroit and had several balls immediately hit his way as Oakland lost a third straight game since an impressive four-game sweep of the New York Yankees over the weekend.	"We could have done something a little differently, but if it got down there we wanted another left-handed bat in the lineup and he wanted to play, so he did a nice job with that," manager Bob Melvin said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: INF Marwin Gonzalez, who injured his left hand earlier this month, didn't play against a lefty starter -- his second straight game out of the lineup. He is healthy but Hinch said he wants to wait until the weekend at Seattle to use Gonzalez against left-handed pitchers. ... Rehabbing RHP Collin McHugh, who is dealing with elbow discomfort and is yet to pitch this year, threw 24 pitches in live batting practice in Florida and "felt fine" according to Hinch. The plan is for him to do another similar session.	Athletics: 3B Matt Chapman sat out for a third straight day with a left knee infection. An antibiotic is helping. "Swelling's coming down a little bit, range of motion better. I'm not sure when we're going to be comfortable putting him in the field yet, but it's not today," Melvin said. ... RF Matt Joyce returned to the lineup leading off after missing Tuesday with back tightness. ... SS Marcus Semien, who had right wrist surgery April 18, will begin his spring training-like rehab assignment Friday with Class-A Stockton. It's not going to be just a handful of games, Melvin said. ... RHP Chris Bassitt, working back from Tommy John surgery in May 2016, threw 15 pitches over two simulated innings.	ROAD STREAK	Houston's nine straight victories at the Coliseum mark the Astros' longest road winning streak in a single venue since 11 in a row at Cincinnati's Great American Ball Park from 2007-09. Houston will go for a sweep in Thursday afternoon's series finale.	UP NEXT	Rookie RHP David Paulino (1-0) looks to follow up his first major league victory with another stellar start in the series finale opposite A's RHP Jesse Hahn (3-4), who is 2-0 with a 2.81 ERA in three outings since coming off the DL on June 6.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

SEATTLE --  After five innings of offensive futility, Jarrod Dyson was just looking to get on base. He did, and turned the game around.	Dyson's bunt single broke up Justin Verlander's bid for a perfect game in the sixth inning Wednesday night and sparked the Seattle Mariners to a 7-5 comeback win over the Detroit Tigers.	Nelson Cruz had three RBI and Mitch Haniger homered as Seattle overcame a 4-0 deficit with three runs in the sixth and four in the seventh to hand the Tigers their fifth consecutive defeat.	Verlander retired his first 16 batters but didn't make it through the sixth. With one out, the speedy Dyson gave the Mariners their first baserunner, beating out a drag bunt between the mound and first that Verlander was unable to reach.	"I was just trying to get something going," said Dyson, whose earlier throwing error helped Detroit build a 4-0 lead. "The guy was having a perfect game on us. I'm not just going to keep going up there hacking at him. I know how our matchups have been in the past. He always wins the battle, so I had to just try to play my game and I was able to get down a good bunt."	Mike Zunino walked and Jean Segura, just activated from the disabled list, followed with a broken-bat single to load the bases.	Ben Gamel lined a single to make it 4-1. Robinson Cano struck out looking, but Cruz followed with a two-run double to left field, chasing Verlander after 110 pitches. He struck out 11 and walked one.	Verlander had no problem with Dyson bunting to break up a no-hit bid.	"It was a perfect bunt," Verlander said. "That's part of his game. I don't think it was quite too late, given the situation, to bunt, especially being as how that's a major part of what he does. I really didn't have any issues with it. It wasn't like I got upset about it."	Haniger tied the score with his sixth homer, driving an 0-1 pitch from Shane Greene (1-1) over the wall in left to open the seventh. Segura and Gamel reached on consecutive two-out singles and Cano followed with a two-run double to right-center to give the Mariners a 6-4 lead. Cruz's single to center scored Cano.	"Sixth and seventh inning, they just hit us," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said. "They got hits, they scored runs, scored seven runs in those two innings and that was the ballgame."	Tony Zych (3-2) pitched 1 2/3 scoreless innings for the win. Nick Vincent worked the eighth and Edwin Diaz finished for his 12th save, despite allowing a two-out homer to Ian Kinsler, his seventh.	Verlander, who has pitched two no-hitters, was charged with three runs and four hits.	Detroit scored twice in the sixth to open a 4-0 lead against starter James Paxton. Miguel Cabrera and J.D. Martinez opened with consecutive singles and both runners advanced on a throwing error by Dyson in center. Justin Upton followed with a two-run single.	James McCann led off the third with his eighth home run to put the Tigers in front. They made it 2-0 in the fourth when Martinez doubled and Upton followed with an RBI single.	"The way he was throwing out there, I just thought if we could get him in the stretch, get him off his comfort zone, and we did," Mariners manager Scott Servais said about Verlander. "Dyson made a great bunt and kind of took it from there. I can't say enough, when you're facing that quality of a pitcher who's on top of his game, you just have to hang in there, hang in there, keep grinding, keep grinding. Once we got him in the stretch, we got some pitches we could hit. We didn't kill the ball by any means against him, but we got enough to get it going and get into their bullpen."	STAYING HOT	Gamel extended his hitting streak to 13 games. During that span, he's hitting .463 with seven doubles, one triple, one home run and 21 runs, raising his batting average to .354.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners RHP Hisashi Iwakuma (right shoulder inflammation), who allowed four runs in two innings Monday in his second rehab start at Triple-A Tacoma, is expected to throw a bullpen before making another rehab start. "I don't expect to take a normal turn, which probably would have been Saturday," Servais said. "He'll probably take a day or two extra before he goes back out."	MARINERS MOVES	Segura (high right ankle sprain) was activated from the DL and batted leadoff. INF Tyler Smith was optioned to Triple-A. ... RHP Andrew Moore was called up from Tacoma. RHP Christian Bergman was optioned to Triple-A, and RHP Tyler Cloyd was designated for assignment. ... Seattle signed RHP Sam Carlson, its second-round draft pick and the 55th overall selection, out of Burnsville High School in Minnesota.	UP NEXT	Tigers: LHP Daniel Norris (4-4, 4.42 ERA) has won his last two starts, allowing five runs over 11 innings. He is 0-1 with a 5.19 ERA in four career appearances against the Mariners.	Mariners: Moore makes his major league debut. One of the team's top pitching prospects, Moore began the season at Double-A Arkansas. He quickly earned a promotion to Triple-A, and was 3-1 with a 3.19 ERA and 44 strikeouts in eight starts at Tacoma.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

PHILADELPHIA -- Aaron Nola felt like himself again.	Nola pitched shutout ball into the eighth inning, Freddy Galvis and Tommy Joseph homered, and the Philadelphia Phillies beat the St. Louis Cardinals 5-1 Thursday to stop a five-game losing streak.	Nola (4-5) allowed one run, four hits and two walks in 7 1/3 innings and struck out eight.	"I know what I'm capable of and know what I can do," Nola said. "Today was me. I felt confident in all of my pitches."	The 24-year-old right-hander had a promising start to his career, but he did not pitch after July 20 last season because of right elbow trouble. He has been inconsistent this season.	"That looked like the old Nola, and that was great to see," Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said. "That's the Nola we have come to love. He was outstanding, hitting paint on both sides."	Joseph drove in three runs as Philadelphia, a major league-worst 23-48, won for just the second time in 15 games.	"Positive vibes, right?" Joseph said. "You have to keep your heads up. It's a long season. It's easy to get lost in the record, but we have the opportunity to make a personal difference and team difference every day."	Paul DeJong homered on a hanging curveball leading off the eighth, pulling the Cardinals to 3-1, and Matt Carpenter walked with one out. Pat Neshek relieved and got Tommy Pham to ground into an inning-ending double play, and Luis Garcia followed with a perfect ninth.	Carlos Martinez (6-6) gave up three runs -- two earned -- and six hits with four strikeouts in six innings. The Cardinals, who made three errors, had won their previous five games against the Phillies.	"He was making pitches on the corners, getting a little help early and a lot of early outs so that kept hit pitch count down," Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said of Nola. "His breaking ball was good."	Galvis homered in the first and Joseph leading off the fifth. With two on and two outs, Andres Blanco scored from second on an errant flip to second by shortstop Aledmys Diaz after his fine grab of Galvis' liner up the middle.	Left fielder Jose Martinez dropped Odubel Herrera's fly ball in the eighth for a two-base error, and Joseph followed with a two-run, two-out single.	BASERUNNING GAFFE II	Herrera was picked off third base in the fourth inning. In Wednesday's 7-6 loss, Herrera ran through third-base coach Juan Samuel's stop sign in the ninth and was out by 10 feet.	"I can't say I was happy," Mackanin said. "You have to be aware. He didn't take that hard step back. I'm not pleased about it."	GOING DEEP	St. Louis has homered in 11 straight games and has 20 home runs since June 16. The Cardinals had scored four or more runs in their previous 11 games.	STREAKING I	Cardinals' Yadier Molina extended his hitting streak to 10 games with a seventh-inning single. He is batting .293 over the stretch.	STREAKING II	Neshek extended his scoreless innings streak to 15 innings while making it 18 straight innings at home without allowing a run.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: OF Dexter Fowler did not play, a day after experiencing left quadriceps tightness.	UP NEXT	Cardinals: RHP Adam Wainwright (7-5, 5.75) is to start for St. Louis as the Cardinals open a three-game home series against the Pirates. Wainwright set career highs for earned runs (nine) and home runs allowed (three) over 1 2/3 innings in a 15-7 loss Saturday at Baltimore, the shortest start of his big league career.	Phillies: Philadelphia opens a nine-game trip at Arizona on Friday night. Mark Leiter (0-0) was in the clubhouse Thursday and is expected to be recalled from Triple-A Lehigh Valley to make his first big league start. The 26-year-old right-hander, who made 12 relief appearances for the Phillies earlier this season, is a son of former big league pitcher Mark Leiter and the nephew of former pitcher Al Leiter.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

MINNEAPOLIS -- Playing cards. Kicking soccer balls. Dancing to the music. Watching movies. Just hanging out with the guys.	Whatever the Chicago White Sox needed to pass the time with the uncooperative weather was well worth the wait.	Jose Abreu and Todd Frazier each hit two-run homers in the first inning, Jose Quintana cruised behind the extra support, and the White Sox beat Minnesota 9-0 on Thursday after a rain-delayed start of 4 hours, 50 minutes that was the longest in Twins history.	"They've been able to respond well," White Sox manager Rick Renteria said. "That's just part of who they are."	Frazier first described the experience as "miserable." Then he raved about strong team chemistry and a loose clubhouse atmosphere that aided the wait.	"We're having a good time," Frazier said. "We enjoy each other's company."	Quintana (4-8) departed with two outs in the seventh inning after throwing 113 pitches. He scattered just five singles and struck out nine without a walk for his second consecutive victory. To stay relaxed, Quintana watched "Fast and Furious 7" and "Get Out" on his tablet, giving two thumbs up to the former but not the latter.	"Too much time on the iPad. I may be bored, so I wanted the game to start quick," he said. "It's a little hard, but we don't have control with that. You just stay focused on the game and be ready."	The White Sox have scored 20 runs in the past two turns for Quintana, whose run-support average of 3.91 per game since 2012 entering the afternoon was the third lowest in the major leagues among active pitchers. That included no runs in four of his first seven starts this year.	Beginning to find his rhythm for a White Sox rotation that badly needs some stability, Quintana has a 2.25 ERA in four starts this month. His changeup was the key to this one, helping him strike Twins slugger Miguel Sano out three times.	"We had trouble picking it up all day, and the curveball was there, too," Twins manager Paul Molitor said. "He did what a veteran, polished starter will do."	Unlike rookie Nik Turley (0-2), who recorded only two outs while giving up six hits and five runs before the first of five Twins relievers -- including backup catcher Chris Gimenez's sixth appearance of the season -- was summoned. The White Sox had seven runs before the Twins even got eight outs.	Matt Davidson had three hits with a home run , and Adam Engel had four hits and the first two RBIs of his career.	TWO FOR ONE	By the time Turley threw his first pitch at 5 p.m. local time, perhaps 10 percent of the announced paid attendance of 27,684 remained. The Twins granted all ticket-holders an exchange for a seat of equal or lesser value for any game from Aug. 29 through Oct. 1.	TURLEY TO TRIPLE-A	Turley was sent to Triple-A Rochester afterward. Infielder Ehire Adrianza (abdominal issues) went to the disabled list too, so the Twins will promote two pitchers from the minors Friday. In three starts, Turley gave up 23 hits and 17 runs over just 9 1/3 innings. In this one, his changeup turned into a batting-practice fastball.	"My curveball's my best pitch, so I should have gone to it more," Turley said. "I regret not going to it."	THE GREAT ABREU ROAD TRIP	Abreu has hit all 13 of his home runs on the road, a White Sox record to start a season. The last time he went deep at Guaranteed Rate Field was Sept. 15, 2016.	REMEMBER WHEN?	The White Sox once waited out a 7 1/2-hour rain delay in Chicago, finally declaring a postponement before the game ever began against Texas on Aug. 12, 1990.	The White Sox preferred to reschedule for four days later when both teams had an off day, but the Rangers didn't want to return to Chicago for one day before starting a home series against the White Sox the following weekend. So the game was actually made up as a doubleheader in Texas, five days after the marathon wait.	UP NEXT	White Sox: RHP Mike Pelfrey (3-5, 3.56 ERA) will pitch Friday in Chicago to start a three-game series against Oakland. He's 3-1 with a 2.03 ERA over his past six turns. For the Athletics, RHP Jharel Cotton (4-7, 5.40 ERA) will start.	Twins: LHP Adalberto Mejia (1-3, 5.53 ERA) will take the mound Friday in Cleveland to begin a three-game series. He has topped five innings just twice in nine starts. RHP Trevor Bauer (6-5, 5.54 ERA) will pitch for the Indians.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Carlos Gomez was munching on a doughnut and a piece of watermelon simultaneously before the game, when he predicted he would hit a home run.	Then there was the recording of a rooster call the Texas center fielder wanted played for one of his teammates.	Turns out things went even better than he planned.	Gomez went deep twice for a career high-matching five RBI and the Rangers beat the Toronto Blue Jays 11-4 on Thursday for a split of the four-game series.	"I've been feeling really well at the plate the last couple of games, and I've been keeping up the good work," said Gomez, who has five homers in his six games since returning from the disabled list after missing a month with a right hamstring strain.	Mike Napoli and Robinson Chirinos also homered for the Rangers (36-36), won for the ninth time in 13 games to get back to .500 before playing 20 of their next 26 games on the road.	After his pregame snack, Gomez had sent a recording of a rooster call to the public address announcer, asking it to be played for Rangers slugger Joey Gallo, whose last name in Spanish translates to rooster.	Instead, the call got played when Gomez came to bat in the second inning and had a single.	"I want to put it up to make fun of him, so they confused it and put it on mine," Gomez said.	That rooster call got played again after Gomez hit a three-run shot in the third that ricocheted off the left-field foul pole and put Texas up 6-0. He added a two-run homer in the seventh.	"When he's locked in, he's extremely challenging, he's a true professional hitter with a ton of power," manager Jeff Banister said.	The Blue Jays (35-37), who beat Texas in the AL Division Series each of the past two seasons, lost for the ninth straight time when they had a chance to reach .500 for the first time this season. They have been outscored 73-24 in those nine losses.	"It's been a battle trying to get back to that .500 mark. ... It seems we get knocked around pretty good on that day," Jays manager John Gibbons said. "If it was a team that never won big games and hadn't experienced it, I'd look at it differently. We just can't seem to give over that hump yet, and we will."	Martin Perez (4-6) went six innings, and all four runs he allowed came with two outs in the fifth. The lefty struck out three, walked two and hit a batter.	Marcus Stroman (7-4) matched a career high allowing seven runs over four innings, giving up three homers. The right-hander has lost consecutive starts after going 6-0 in his 10 games before that.	"The long ball hurt me," Stroman said. "Just didn't have a good feel of my sinker and all of the other pitches kind of played off of that. I'll make a few adjustments."	BELTRE WATCH	Adrian Beltre put the Rangers ahead to stay with an RBI double in the first. Beltre added another double in the seventh, his 2,962nd hit, one behind Sam Crawford for 33rd all-time. He had a sacrifice fly in the eighth for his 1,587th RBI.	SHORT HOPS	The Rangers won four games during the seven-game homestand. They scored at least 10 runs in three of those wins. ... Chirinos, the No. 2 catcher, homered for the fourth time in his past seven starts. He also doubled twice. ... Shin-Soo Choo walked twice, making the eighth consecutive game he has reached base multiple times. He has reached base in 28 of 56 plate appearances his past 12 games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: 3B Josh Donaldson was a late scratch from the lineup as the DH because of left knee soreness. ... LF Steve Pearce didn't play a day after bruising his right knee when crashing into the wall on Joey Gallo's inside-the-park home run.	Rangers: RHP Jeremy Jeffress (strained lower back muscle) was put on the 10-day DL, and RHP Preston Claiborne's contract was purchased from Triple-A Round Rock. Jeffress first felt something wrong when warming up before pitching Tuesday. "The next morning I couldn't get up out of bed," he said.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays: J.A. Happ (2-4) starts the opener of a weekend series in Kansas City.	Rangers: Yu Darvish (6-5) pitches against the New York Yankees in his first MLB matchup against fellow Japanese starter Masahiro Tanaka (5-7).	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

MILWAUKEE --  Travis Shaw and Corey Knebel were too much for the Pittsburgh Pirates.	Shaw drove in three runs with a home run and two doubles and Knebel set a modern-era record for most consecutive games by a reliever with a strikeout at a season's start and the Milwaukee Brewers beat the Pirates 4-2 on Thursday.	"The guy is seeing all of my pitches really well," Ivan Nova said of Shaw. "Give him the guy credit, too. He's one of the hitters I've tried to find a way to get out."	Knebel struck out Josh Bell on a foul tip leading off the ninth. The 25-year-old right-hander retired Elias Diaz and Andrew McCutchen on popouts, finishing a four-hitter for his 12th save in 15 chances.	"He came back today and was just as good as he's been every single day," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said of Knebel. "Credit to him. He should be proud of what he just accomplished. That's pretty special."	Aroldis Chapman had set the mark since 1900 as part of a streak of 49 games for Cincinnati that began in August 2013 and ended the following August.	Shaw put the Brewers ahead 3-2, lining a run-scoring double off Nova in the fifth.	"I pitch hard inside, the guy hits a bullet to first base," Nova said. "Threw a curve ball, he hit a homer. Threw a sinker over the plate, he almost hit a homer. So, you have to tip your cap to him."	Shaw hit a drive off the yellow line on the top of the left-field fence with two on in the seventh. Shaw raised an arm to signal home run while he ran the bases, and the ricochet was caught by John Jaso. The left fielder threw to third baseman Josh Harrison, who fired home to Diaz. Domingo Santana, who had been on first, jogged into the tag for the inning's final out.	Shaw's been playing with the emotional weight of a newly born daughter who has heart complications.	"He's doing an outstanding job with everything going on," Counsell said. "I really think the park is the easy place for him, a place he's able to come do his job. He's doing it really well."	Chase Anderson (6-2) allowed two runs and two hits in six innings.	Nova (7-5) gave up four runs and 11 hits -- matching his career high -- in seven innings. He threw a season-high 107 pitches.	Pirates manager Clint Hurdle appreciated that Nova gritted his way through seven innings, especially after a tough first inning.	"It wasn't his A game today, probably a B game," Hurdle said. "It just showed you his ability to continue to compete, make pitches and keep a team in the game."	Josh Bell hit an RBI single in the first. Eric Thames tied the score with an RBI single in the bottom half that stopped an 0-for-15 skid, and Shaw homered for a 2-1 lead.	Gregory Polanco hit a homered in the fourth, and Shaw hit a go-ahead double in the fifth.	SOGARD SO GOOD	The Brewers' Eric Sogard set a career high with his fourth game with three or more hits this season. He extended his hitting streak to 10 games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: C Francisco Cervelli was placed on the seven-day concussion DL for the second time this season. His first trip came after taking a foul tip off his mask at Baltimore on June 6. He came back June 14 and did not play in the four-game series with Milwaukee. C Jacob Stallings was recalled from Triple-A Indianapolis.	Brewers: INF Jonathan Villar (lower back strain) and OF Ryan Braun (strained left calf) are with Class A Wisconsin for rehab assignments and were to play Thursday night against Kane County. There's a chance the two could be activated Tuesday for a three-game series in Cincinnati.	UP NEXT	Pirates: RHP Jameson Taillon (3-2) starts Friday against St. Louis, where Pittsburgh has lost seven straight, including three games in April.	Brewers: RHP Jimmy Nelson (5-3) is to be on the mound Friday at Atlanta for the start of a six-game trip after beating San Diego 2-1 Saturday with a six-hitter for his first big league complete game.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

DENVER -- Zack Godley got off to a rough start, quickly recovered and turned in a gem for the surging Arizona Diamondbacks.	Godley shook off a leadoff home run to throw well into the eighth inning, Paul Goldschmidt and Chris Owings hit three-run homers, and the Diamondbacks beat the Colorado Rockies 10-3 on Thursday.	Goldschmidt finished with three hits and four RBI to increase his season total to 64, tops in the majors.	Arizona took two of three in the NL West matchup and is now tied with Colorado for second place in the division behind the Dodgers. The Diamondbacks have won 12 of 14 and are a season-high 19 games above .500 after a 7-1 road trip.	"We came in here and did what we needed to do," Godley said. "More for ourselves than anybody it showed we're playing good ball. Keep trying to carry that over into the next day."	Godley's day started with Charlie Blackmon reaching down to send an 84 mph curveball into the Arizona bullpen, but he shut down the Rockies from there and retired 13 straight in one stretch.	Blackmon drew a walk in the third, then Godley erased him with a double-play ball to end the inning. He didn't allow a hit after Nolan Arenado's one-out single in the first and retired 19 of the next 20 batters before Raimel Tapia and Pat Valaika singled and doubled to lead off the eighth.	"He made a great swing on a good pitch. In that spot you have to tip your hat," Godley said of Blackmon's 16th homer. "Kind of settled in and the defense played unbelievable behind me."	Godley (3-1) allowed three runs on four hits and struck out eight in seven-plus innings. He also helped himself with an RBI single in the eighth.	"He did a great job, pitched into the eighth inning and did everything we needed him to do on a day like today," Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said. "Teams play tired baseball on these day games and our guys went out there with energy. Zack set the tone."	The Diamondbacks hit a Colorado rookie pitcher hard for the second straight night. Wednesday they scored 10 runs in the fourth off Jeff Hoffman, and Thursday they battered right-hander Antonio Senzatela (9-3) for nine runs in five innings.	Senzatela started well this season but he has struggled of late. His ERA was 2.81 heading into May but is now at 4.79 after Thursday. He is 2-1 with an 8.86 ERA in four starts in June.	"Today, I feel really good. But I threw a couple (pitches) up and they got me," Senzatela said. "I didn't have really good fastball command. It was a bad day."	Owings' homer in the third, his ninth, made it 5-1, and Goldschmidt hit his 18th to cap a four-run fourth to make it 9-1.	"It's tough to overcome two three-run homers, really tough to overcome that," Rockies manager Bud Black said.	The Rockies have dropped two straight after winning six in a row.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: OF Yasmany Tomas (right groin tendinitis) ran the bases and was scheduled to take batting practice Thursday. Manager Torey Lovullo said Tomas is feeling better but not 100 percent. "There's something in there that is continuing to make him feel uncomfortable," Lovullo said. "We don't want to keep pushing forward unless he's ready to go."	Rockies: LHP Tyler Anderson (left knee inflammation) was activated from the 10-day disabled list and was assigned to the bullpen. RHP Carlos Estevez was optioned to Triple-A Albuquerque. Anderson, who was in the rotation before going on the DL in early June, pitched the ninth inning.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: LHP Patrick Corbin (6-6, 5.19 ERA) starts the first of four games against Philadelphia on Friday. Corbin is 5-0 with a 3.35 ERA in his last seven starts at Chase Field.	Rockies: LHP Kyle Freeland (8-4, 3.42 ERA) opens a big three-game series against the Dodgers in Los Angeles on Friday night. He is 1-0 with a 1.80 in two career starts against L.A.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- Josh Reddick will take a three-hit game any time. This one meant just a little bit more to the Houston Astros outfielder, though.	"You always want to do well against your former team," said Reddick, who played in Oakland for parts of five seasons. "I enjoy beating them regardless. Whether I got 0 for 4 or I go 4 for 4. So, it is fun."	Reddick homered and scored four runs, Jake Marisnick and Marwin Gonzalez each went deep and the Astros beat the Athletics 12-9 on Thursday.	The major league-leading Astros completed a four-game sweep with their 10th straight victory in Oakland and their 15th win in 16 games against the A's overall. They've won 12 of their last 14 road games. Their 27-8 record away from home is the best in the majors.	Reddick also doubled, tripled and drew a walk, and Marisnick and Gonzalez each drove in three runs.	Reddick didn't get a shot at a single to complete the cycle after tripling in the eighth inning.	"I think anybody would want to have a shot at it just to see," Reddick said. "Once you get to that one, you want to see the boys bat around for you and get up there to get the opportunity to do it.	"I got asked a few times if I was going to stop if it was in the gap. I was, like, `Nah, I can't do that.' If it's in the gap, I'm going two. I don't have it in me to be that guy to get the personal goal."	David Paulino (2-0) struck out six and gave up three runs, seven hits and two walks. The 23-year-old rookie right-hander struck out five of his first six batters in his sixth career start.	Astros center fielder George Springer left with a left hand contusion after being struck by a fastball from Jesse Hahn (3-5) leading off the game. The ball also grazed Springer's left shoulder. Springer is tied for second in the AL with 21 home runs. X-rays taken during the game were negative, manager A.J. Hinch said. Springer's status is day-to-day.	Springer said after the game he has no intention of going on the disabled list.	"No," Hinch said. "I'm hoping he'll be able to play tomorrow."	Hahn gave up 10 runs (nine earned) in two innings. He acknowledged that hitting Springer threw him off.	"Yeah I think maybe that affected (me)," Hahn said. "For me, my game is coming inside on righties, throwing my sinker in on righties and I kind of babied it in there after that. I started spiking a lot, yanking stuff and it just wasn't good."	Oakland trailed 10-0 after two innings and 12-3 going into the eighth, when Adam Rosales' two-run double highlighted a six-run inning.	Nori Aoki was 3 for 5 with a double for Houston.	A's catcher Bruce Maxwell, called up from Triple-A Nashville earlier in the day, was 3 for 4 with a double.	FIRST TO 400	The Astros became the first team in the majors to reach the 400-run mark. "Shows how special our lineup can be," Reddick said.	ROSTER MOVES	Athletics: C Stephen Vogt was designated for assignment. Maxwell and 1B/OF Matt Olson were called up from Triple-A Nashville.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: 2B Jose Altuve didn't play on Thursday, and Hinch said he wanted to give the reigning American League batting champion an off day.	Athletics: INF Matt Chapman was placed on the 10-day disabled list with a bacterial skin infection on his left knee (retroactive to June 19).	UP NEXT	Astros: RHP Joe Musgrove (4-6, 5.09 ERA) will make his third start since coming off the disabled list with shoulder discomfort in the series opener against the Mariners.	Athletics: RHP Jharel Cotton (4-7, 5.40) will face the Chicago White Sox for the first time. Cotton has allowed 12 home runs over 39 2/3 innings over his last seven starts.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

BALTIMORE --  The Cleveland Indians put on another offensive show against a Baltimore Orioles pitching staff that's poised to set a record for extended futility.	Austin Jackson had three hits and three RBI, Erik Gonzalez homered and the Indians pounded out 13 hits in a 6-3 victory Thursday night.	The Indians won three of four from the Orioles to complete a 7-1 road trip that began with a four-game sweep of Minnesota. Cleveland has scored at least five runs and reached double figures in hits over nine consecutive games, and homered in 11 straight.	"It kind of starts at the top and it trickles its way down to the bottom, from the 1-hole hitter to the 9-hole hitter," Jackson said. "It seemed like everyone was having good at-bats."	Baltimore's struggling pitchers were overmatched against that kind of firepower. The Orioles were outscored 28-10 in the series and have given up at least five runs in 19 straight games, one short of the major league record set by the 1924 Philadelphia Phillies.	Starter Wade Miley (3-5) gave up four runs in five-plus innings and Gonzalez hit a solo shot off Richard Bleier in the sixth to make it 5-2 and extend the streak.	"We're going out there and working our tails off trying to work on track," Miley said, "and I think we're moving in the right direction."	Cleveland starter Mike Clevinger (3-3) walked four and hit two batters in five innings, but he only gave up two runs to earn his first win in five starts since May 20.	"That's the ultimate bend but don't break," Indians manager Terry Francona said.	The victory lifted Cleveland a season-high seven games over .500 (39-32) and lengthened its lead over second-place Minnesota in the AL Central to 2 1/2 games.	Seth Smith homered for the Orioles, who have lost 11 of 15.	"There's not a single person that has any sympathy for us, and I get it," cleanup hitter Mark Trumbo said.	Baltimore played without manager Buck Showalter, who left the team to attend the birth of his first grandchild. Bench coach John Russell took over as manager.	After Smith put the Orioles ahead with his fourth leadoff homer of the season, Jackson hit an RBI triple and scored on a single by Yan Gomes in the second inning.	Baltimore pulled even in the bottom half when Clevinger hit two batters and walked Jonathan Schoop with the bases loaded .	In the third, Jackson followed a pair of walks with a two-out, two-run single for a 4-2 lead.	RAMIREZ STOPPED	Cleveland's Jose Ramirez went 1 for 4, ending his run of successive multihit games at nine -- the team's longest streak since 1936.	Ramirez hasn't had a day off since May 21, so Francona asked him if he wanted to take a break.	"He's like, `Not now," Francona said. "I get it, man. I'll just stay out of his way."	ROSTER MOVE	Indians: Clevinger was recalled from Triple-A Columbus before the game, and RHP Cody Allen was placed on the paternity list.	Orioles: After the game, RHP Gabriel Ynoa was optioned to Triple-A Norfolk.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: LF Michael Brantley (sprained ankle) took batting practice Thursday and is expected to do running drills Friday. Francona said Brantley, who is eligible to return Monday, shouldn't need a rehab assignment.	Orioles: RHP Darren O'Day (shoulder) is expected to come off the 10-day disabled list Friday. ... CF Adam Jones was given the night off. It was a preventive measure, because Jones missed time recently with a sore hip and Baltimore's next six games are on artificial turf. ... Closer Zach Britton (forearm strain) pitched a scoreless inning for Class A Delmarva on Thursday. He will pitch again for the Shorebirds on Saturday.	UP NEXT	Indians: Trevor Bauer (6-5, 5.54 ERA) makes his team-high 15th start in the opener of a three-game series against the visiting Twins.	Orioles: Back in the starting rotation after being exiled to the bullpen, Ubaldo Jimenez (2-2, 6.25 ERA) helps launch a three-game series on the road against AL East rival Tampa Bay.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

NEW YORK --  Cameron Maybin and the Los Angeles Angels turned a little mayhem into a lot of runs.	Albert Pujols lined a go-ahead single that drove in Maybin during a messy, four-run rally in the seventh inning and the Angels overcame Aaron Judge's major league-leading 25th homer to beat the New York Yankees 10-5 on Thursday night.	The Angels took advantage of three errors and two wild pitches -- including a heater by Dellin Betances that sailed to the backstop -- during a late surge. Los Angeles sent the AL East leaders to their eighth loss in nine games.	"Love creating chaos," the speedy Maybin said. "Making those guys frantic."	Maybin led off the game with a home run against Luis Severino (5-3). But with the Angels trailing 5-4, it was Maybin's potential double-play grounder that skipped past second baseman Starlin Castro for an error and set up the comeback.	Maybin then stole his AL-high 22nd base, prompting a wild throw on the play. In the eighth, he drew a pickoff throw at first that bounced away, letting another run score.	Behind 5-1 early, the Angels kept swinging. Maybin wound up scoring three times, and has safely reached in a career-high 26 straight games.	"You get knocked down," Maybin said, "but we don't get knocked out."	Yankees manager Joe Girardi saw a lot that needed fixing.	"I believe we're much better than what we've been playing, but right now we're going through a hard time like a lot of teams do. I mean, there's some things we have to get ironed out, there's no doubt about that," he said.	Yusmeiro Petit (2-0) tossed two perfect innings in relief of starter Jesse Chavez, who labored through 93 pitches in just four innings. Petit and three other relievers retired 14 straight batters until Chris Carter singled with two outs in the ninth.	Judge launched a three-run shot into the netting that protects Monument Park in straightaway center field in the second. The drive drew chants of "MVP! MVP!" for the rookie slugger, and extended his streak of safely reaching base to a career-best 24 games.	Cliff Pennington had three hits for the Angels. He singled and scored on Pujols' single in the third, singled off Severino to begin the seventh-inning rally and doubled to open a two-run eighth.	Kole Calhoun's sacrifice fly off Chasen Shreve made it 5-all in the seventh. Maybin stole second, continued to third on catcher Gary Sanchez's throwing error and scored on Pujols' single off Betances for a 6-5 lead.	Betances compounded the problems with an especially wild pitch -- it caromed so hard and far off the screen, Sanchez almost threw out a runner at third.	"Right when I was about to throw the pitch I realized this could be bad, because Gary looked like he was waiting curveball and I was throwing fastball. So I tried to do my best to not kill him there," Betances said.	Andrelton Simmons added a two-run double that made it 8-5. Betances had gone 22 straight appearances without permitting an earned run.	Yankees reliever Domingo German threw a wild pitch in the eighth and also bounced a pickoff toss to first that allowed a run to score.	Los Angeles took two of three from the Yankees for the second time in 11 days. At 4-2, the Angels posted their first season series win over New York since 2008.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: RHP Huston Street was activated from the disabled list. He'd been out since spring training because of a strained back muscle. ... OF Mike Trout (thumb) will begin hitting off a tee this weekend. ... RHP Matt Shoemaker (forearm) is going back to the West Coast for further evaluation.	BYE	Chavez has given up a home run in 13 straight games, the longest active streak in the majors. He already had set the Angels' team record in that dubious department.	JUDGE'S FAN CLUB	Angels bench coach Dino Ebel introduced himself to Judge during batting practice, and had a request. "My boys are 8 and 9, and they're in awe of him. They said it would be awesome if I could get a picture with him," Ebel said." The new star obliged, further impressing the longtime major and minor league coach. "He's amazing to watch," he said. "I'd heard he was a really good person, too."	UP NEXT	Angels: RHP Alex Meyer (3-3, 3.52 ERA) starts at Fenway Park on Friday night vs. Rick Porcello (3-9, 5.05) and the Red Sox. Meyer has a 1.19 ERA in four starts since coming off the DL.	Yankees: RHP Masahiro Tanaka (5-7, 5.63) opposes Texas RHP Yu Darvish (6-5, 3.35) for the first time in the majors. Tanaka said he recalled their last matchup, won by Darvish six years ago in Japan's top league. "I think it's something hopefully that Japanese baseball fans are looking forward to," Tanaka said through a translator.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

MIAMI --  Addison Russell has found a groove after a slow start.	Russell tied a career high with four hits, including a home run, to pace the Chicago Cubs to an 11-1 victory over the Miami Marlins on Thursday night.	"Addison looks really comfortable," Cubs manager Joe Maddon said.	Russell drove in two and also had two doubles, giving him three extra-base hits in a game for the first time in his career. He is hitting .382 (13 for 34) with four home runs and 10 RBI in his last 10 games. He batted .207 with three homers in 55 games prior to this stretch.	"I feel fine, I feel OK," Russell said. "I feel like I'm sticking to my approach, seeing the ball well, and just most importantly having good ABs."	Kris Bryant had a three-run homer, Willson Contreras added a two-run shot and Ian Happ also had four hits and drove in a pair for the Cubs, who have won four of five.	"It was really good to see," Russell said. "The bats came alive tonight."	Jake Arrieta (7-5) pitched seven innings, allowing one run and six hits. He struck out three and did not walk a batter over 82 pitches.	"I had low energy today, but that made me stay within myself and maintain a good delivery and focus on executing a good sinker down in the strike zone and our defense was phenomenal tonight," Arrieta said.	Arrieta also picked up two of the Cubs' 16 hits.	"He pitched well tonight and he got two knocks, a Silver Slugger guy," Russell said. "He's quite a talent."	It was the first of an 11-game, 11-day trip for the Cubs, who entered having won six of their previous 22 road games.	"I don't want to get too crazy over one game, but it was a nice game," Maddon said.	Jeff Locke (0-3) allowed five runs and seven hits in four innings for the Marlins.	"It's just a constant struggle so far, finishing off innings," Locke said. "There's three outs to an inning, not just two. That's what we've had a hard time with. ... That's where our hiccups been now. That needs to change."	Arrieta knocked in the Cubs' first run with an infield hit in the second and Mark Zagunis followed with a groundout scoring another run in his first major league at-bat after being called up from Triple-A Iowa in place of struggling slugger Kyle Schwarber.	Marcell Ozuna hit his 20th home run for the Marlins to cut the deficit to 2-1.	Bryant's three-run shot, his 16th, extended the Cubs' lead to 5-1 in the fourth.	"The three-run homer was large," Maddon said.	Russell's solo shot, his seventh, and Contreras's two-run homer, also his seventh, pushed the lead to 8-1.	"Ozuna's homer gets us to 2-1 and you feel like we've got a game here," Marlins manager Don Mattingly said. "... Then we didn't seem to be able to stop them the rest of the day."	Russell had an RBI double in the eighth, and Happ followed with a two-run double to cap the scoring.	OZUNA PILING UP HITS	Ozuna went 2 for 4, giving him his 30th multihit game of the season. His career high for multihit games in a season is 39 set last year.	ARRIETA SHARP AGAINST THE MARLINS	Arrieta improved to 3-0 with a 1.38 ERA in four starts against the Marlins. He has struck out 26 and walked four in 26 innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: Placed RF Jason Heyward (left hand abrasion) on the 10-day disabled list retroactive to June 19.	Marlins: Placed RHP Brad Ziegler (right back strain) on the 10-day disabled list retroactive to June 21 and re-instated RHP Junichi Tazawa from the 10-day DL.	UP NEXT	Cubs: RHP John Lackey (5-7, 4.98 ERA) will start the second game of the series Friday. Lackey is 1-2 with a 5.01 ERA in five starts against the Marlins.	Marlins: RHP Jose Urena (5-2, 3.64) will take the mound Friday. Urena has won his last four decisions over six starts.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

ATLANTA --  Lane Adams says he believes the baseball cliche that hitting is contagious.	In the Braves' biggest inning in six years, the hot hitting spread all the way to his spot on the bench.	Adams delivered a pinch-hit, three-run homer in Atlanta's eight-run fifth inning and the Braves held off San Francisco in the ninth to beat the Giants 12-11 in a rain-delayed game Thursday night.	It was the Braves' most runs in an inning since they scored eight in the ninth at the Dodgers on April 19, 2011. Their nine hits in the inning were their most since April 7, 2004, when they had nine in the fourth against the Mets.	"When one guy gets going, the rest fall in line," Adams said. "... It was a great inning."	The big inning left Atlanta with a 12-6 lead. Braves manager Brian Snitker said the eight-run inning "was great" because "we needed them all."	The homer was the first of Adams' career.	The Braves won three of four in the series to cap San Francisco's 1-7 road trip.	"You can look at the good things and the silver linings, but the bottom line is we lost seven games," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "That's not a good trip."	The Giants, last in the NL West, have lost nine of 10. They gave the Braves a scare by scoring two runs off closer Jim Johnson in the ninth.	"That was big," said Hunter Pence, who had two hits but hit a groundout to second base to end the game with two runners on base. "Unfortunately we weren't able to finish it off. We battled pretty hard this whole game."	Brandon Phillips led off the Braves' big inning with a homer off Matt Cain (3-7), the first of six straight hits.	The Braves and Giants combined for seven homers, including four by Atlanta, and 31 hits. Nick Markakis had four hits, including a two-run homer in the first. Matt Adams hit his third homer of the series, and 13th of the season, in the fourth.	Buster Posey drove in three runs with a homer and two doubles for San Francisco. Joe Panik led off the fifth with a homer. Brandon Belt hit his 13th homer off Ian Krol in the eighth.	Jaime Garcia allowed six runs and seven hits in 4 1/3 innings. Rookie Jason Hursh (1-0) recorded the final two outs in the fifth for his first major league win.	Johnson gave one-out singles to Nick Hundley and Denard Span in the ninth before walking Belt to load the bases. Hundley scored on Kelby Tomlinson's fielder's choice grounder, and Panik's fly ball to left field cut the lead to one run.	Johnson earned his 14th save in 19 chances.	Rain delayed the start of the game for the second straight night. The delay lasted 1 hour, 26 minutes.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Giants: Bochy said a decision will be made soon on IF Conor Gillaspie, who has missed 32 games with back spasms. A move with Gillaspie could be connected to the status of 3B Eduardo Nunez (left hamstring), who likely would need to show improvement Friday to avoid the DL.	Braves: Phillips (left groin tightness) and Matt Kemp (left hamstring) left for what Snitker described as precautionary reasons.	STRUGGLES FOR CAIN	Cain doubled in two runs in the second, but he couldn't hold a 5-2 lead. Cain fell to 0-5 in eight road starts as he allowed seven runs and 10 hits in four innings. He gave up a season-high three homers.	RIO RUIZ SENT DOWN	The Braves optioned 3B Rio Ruiz to Triple-A Gwinnett and recalled IF Jace Peterson. Ruiz lost playing time to Johan Camargo, and the Braves want him playing on a regular basis in Gwinnett.	UP NEXT	Giants: LHP Ty Blach (4-4, 4.23) will start in the opening game of a home weekend series in his first career appearance against the Mets on Friday night.	Braves: RHP Mike Foltynewicz (4-5, 4.26) will open the weekend series against Milwaukee on Friday night. Foltynewicz allowed four runs in six innings in a 4-3 loss at the Brewers on April 30.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

SEATTLE -- Andrew Moore justified his surprising call-up with a solid performance -- although Robinson Cano made his job a whole lot easier.	Cano hit a grand slam and a two-run homer, Moore pitched seven effective innings to win in his big league debut, and the Seattle Mariners held off the Detroit Tigers 9-6 on Thursday night for their fifth straight victory.	"That was unbelievable," said Moore, called up Wednesday from Triple-A Tacoma to replace struggling Yovani Gallardo in the rotation. "It felt like I blinked and it was over. It absolutely flew by. That was pretty special, just the way we kind of took that last punch where they started coming back."	Cano's seventh-inning grand slam off Francisco Rodriguez, his 13th homer, put the Mariners up 9-3. His two-run shot off Daniel Norris (4-5) in the third staked Moore to a 5-1 lead.	"The home runs hurt us," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said. "I thought we'd fought our way back into the game a little bit, and Cano's grand slam kind of puts it out of reach."	Moore (1-0) allowed three runs and six hits in seven innings. The 23-year-old right-hander, a second-round pick in 2015 out of Oregon State, struck out four and walked none. He began the season in Double-A, then went 3-1 in eight starts at Tacoma.	"Heck of a debut," Mariners manager Scott Servais said. "You can't say a whole lot more. What an effort. It's kind of what we've seen out of Andrew Moore since the day he put a Mariners jersey on. I think people at Oregon State saw the same thing, and probably at his high school."	The Mariners moved above .500 for the first time this season at 38-37.	Detroit got within three runs at 9-6 in the eighth with four consecutive two-out hits against Max Povse, also making his debut. Povse, called up from Double-A on Sunday, allowed a two-run homer to Miguel Cabrera and an RBI single to Justin Upton. Tony Zych got the final out of the eighth and Steve Cishek pitched a perfect ninth for his first save.	Norris allowed five runs on five hits in six innings as the Tigers lost their season-high sixth straight.	The Mariners capitalized on Norris' lack of command for three runs in the second. Nelson Cruz drew a leadoff walk and Danny Valencia worked a one-out walk. Ben Gamel followed with a two-run double to right-center, extending his hitting streak to 14 games. Guillermo Heredia then singled in Gamel.	Ian Kinsler got a run back for Detroit with two outs in the third with his eighth homer.	Mitch Haniger singled with one out in the bottom half and Cano then lined a 2-1 pitch over the wall in center for his first homer since June 6.	"I'm not looking for my power numbers, but sometimes you've got men in scoring position or in situations," Cano said. "Like tonight, you hit a homer and you put the team ahead. That's what you're looking for. For me, it's not about how many homers I hit. It's just to do my job with men in scoring position."	The Tigers pulled within 5-3 in the fifth on an RBI groundout by Jose Iglesias and a run-scoring single by Kinsler.	"I think once that first pitch, then the nerves kind of went away," Moore said. "But before that, definitely a little bit amped up. It wasn't too bad before the game, but once I threw in the first pitch, that was pretty cool."	TIGERS WOES	The six-game losing streak dropped the Tigers (32-40) to eight games under .500 for the first time since the end of the 2015 season (74-87). "We've got a team that represents what our record is," Kinsler said. "Until we win more games, that's what we represent. We need to start winning games. We need to start playing better. That's the bottom line." It was the first time the Tigers had been swept in a four-game series by Seattle since August 1998.	MARINERS MOVES:	RHP Tyler Cloyd, designated for assignment Wednesday, was optioned to Tacoma after clearing waivers. Cloyd pitched one inning for Seattle after being called up June 2, picking up a victory. He appeared in five games earlier with Tacoma after beginning the season in the independent Atlantic League.	TRAINER'S ROOM:	Tigers: DH Victor Martinez, on the 10-day DL (irregular heartbeat), began light activity Wednesday sooner than anticipated. "They cleared him yesterday to do light, very light, cardio," Ausmus said. "He did 10 minutes on the elliptical and then he hit off a tee."	UP NEXT:	Tigers: RHP Michael Fulmer (6-5) opens the three-game series at San Diego. Fulmer has lost four of his last five starts, but has not given up a home run in 58 innings since April 29.	Mariners: Felix Hernandez (2-2, 4.73) is expected to be activated from the DL (right shoulder inflammation) and start the series opener against Houston. The ace right-hander was 2-0 with 4.15 ERA in three rehab starts at Tacoma.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

LOS ANGELES --  The heat took away the heaviness in the air. The opponent is just struggling.	Oh, and there's that one other thing:	"We're probably the hottest team in baseball right now," the Los Angeles Dodgers' Enrique Hernandez said.	Tough to argue that, especially with the way they're swinging the bats. Joc Pederson hit a go-ahead home run in the seventh and Los Angeles used the long ball again to power past the New York Mets 6-3 on Thursday night and complete a four-game sweep.	Justin Turner and Hernandez also hit home runs for the Dodgers, who had a club-record 15 in the series. It is also the most the Mets have allowed in a four-game series.	"That's stunning," Mets manager Terry Collins said. "That's a stunning number. There were a lot of nights I've been at Dodgers Stadium where the ball at night doesn't fly. It flew out of here this series like nothing."	After Pederson's homer off Paul Sewald (0-2), Los Angeles scored twice more in the inning on bases-loaded walks by Jerry Blevins -- including one to reliever Pedro Baez (1-0) in just his third career plate appearance.	"I was just bad today," Blevins said. "That happens sometimes. Sometimes you stink."	The Dodgers have won seven consecutive games and 13 of their last 14. Kenley Jansen pitched out of a bases-loaded jam in the eighth and got the final four outs for his 16th save. It was his sixth four-out save of the season.	"The thing we're so excited about is everyone is making a contribution," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.	The Dodgers not only had another three home runs, they drew nine walks from three different New York pitchers.	"When guy after guy is taking a quality at-bat, and not necessarily hitting a homer but getting on base, taking walks, moving runners, doing things the right way -- that's when you have success in breaking down starting pitchers and getting into teams' bullpens," Turner said. "And that's what we want to try to do every night."	Curtis Granderson and Travis d'Arnaud homered for the Mets, who have lost seven of their last eight and are a season-worst 10 games under .500 at 31-41.	Mets starter Steven Matz held the Dodgers without a hit until Turner's solo homer with two outs in the third. Cody Bellinger followed with a ground-rule double and Hernandez hit a two-run homer. They were the only hits Matz allowed in six innings. In his third start of the season, Matz allowed three runs, struck out eight and walked five.	"They had a red-hot series and they're really aggressive right now," Matz said.	BALL PITCH	Guard Lorenzo Ball, taken out of UCLA as the No. 2 overall pick in the NBA draft by the Los Angeles Lakers, is scheduled to throw out the first pitch Friday night at Dodger Stadium.	FRUSTRATED METS	The home runs, the walks, the poor overall pitching, the four consecutive losses. It was one rough series for the Mets. Said Collins: "Walks and home runs have killed us. That's one thing we have never done here in years. We don't walk guys and we don't give up a lot of home runs. And right now we're doing both."	POLITICAL DEAL	Jamie McCourt, who along with her then-husband Frank were forced by Major League Baseball to sell the team after it faced bankruptcy, has been nominated as the ambassador to Belgium by President Donald Trump.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: SS Asdrubal Cabrera (left thumb sprain) is expected to be activated Friday in San Francisco. Jose Reyes has been New York's primary shortstop since Cabrera's injury, but is expected to return to third base.	Dodgers: LHP Julio Urias (sore shoulder) remains out of action at the team's training facility in Phoenix. Urias is expected to return to Los Angeles during the weekend for further evaluation as the Dodgers attempt to gauge the seriousness of his injury. "It's still kind of fuzzy," Roberts said.	UP NEXT	Mets: RHP Seth Lugo (1-1) is scheduled to make his third start of the season Friday when the Mets open a three-game series in San Francisco. Lugo missed the start of the season with a partially torn ligament in his right elbow.	Dodgers: LHP Alex Wood (7-0) will take his perfect record into the three-game series opener at home against the division-rival Rockies. Wood started the season in the bullpen, but has gone 6-0 with a 2.08 ERA in 10 starts.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

WASHINGTON --  On a night when right-hander Stephen Strasburg struggled and the Nationals put themselves in an early hole, Washington used the long ball and an unlikely component -- the bullpen -- to pull out a satisfying victory.	Bryce Harper singled in the winning run in the 10th inning, Brian Goodwin homered twice and the Nationals rallied past the Cincinnati Reds 6-5 on Friday night.	Anthony Rendon and Daniel Murphy also homered for the Nationals, who trailed by four runs in the second inning and 5-2 in the sixth before storming back to deal the Reds their 12th loss in 13 games.	Trea Turner singled off Raisel Iglesias (2-2) with one out in the 10th and took third on a single by Goodwin before Harper hit a liner that struck the right-field wall on one bounce.	Harper initially dodged his teammates before finally accepting their hugs and high-fives.	"It was a lot of fun to watch and a lot of fun to be part of," Harper said.	Matt Albers (3-1) pitched the 10th to cap an impressive night for the Nationals' bullpen, a maligned group that blanked the Reds on one hit over the final five innings.	The unit has been a sore spot for Washington -- blowing 12 of 32 save chances -- but this was refreshingly different.	"Our bullpen was tough on them," manager Dusty Baker said. "We talk a lot of stuff about them, but they were outstanding."	Goodwin homered in the first inning and again in the seventh, the first multihomer game of the rookie's career.	Scooter Gennett connected for the skidding Reds.	"That's one I thought was sitting there to win," manager Bryan Price said. "We just didn't get it done."	Seeking his ninth win, Strasburg gave up five runs and eight hits in five innings, walking two and striking out five. It was only the third time in 15 starts he allowed more than three earned runs, but it was also the third straight start in which he failed to go six innings.	Strasburg blamed the heat as much as the Reds' hitters for his abbreviated outing.	"I was trying to go as long as I can and as hard as I can," he said. "I lost about 10 pounds of water."	Reds starter Luis Castillo pitched five effective innings in his major league debut and left with a 5-2 lead, but the Cincinnati bullpen deprived him of the victory. Castillo allowed two runs and five hits, walking five and striking out five.	"I'm happy with the way he threw the ball," Price said. "I would anticipate he's going to get sharper as the season goes on."	The 24-year-old rookie was replaced by Michael Lorenzen, who promptly served up a home run to Murphy and gave up a sacrifice fly to pinch-hitter Stephen Drew later in the sixth.	Wandy Peralta took over in the seventh and, like Lorenzen, gave up a homer to the first batter he faced. Goodwin's drive to right made it 5-all.	Early on, Cincinnati dominated.	The Reds batted around in a four-run first inning that featured Gennett's 10th home run, a run-scoring fly ball by Scott Schebler and successive RBI singles from Devin Mesorasco and Jose Peraza.	ROSTER MOVES	Reds: Castillo was recalled from Double-A Pensacola before the game and LHP Amir Garrett was optioned to Triple-A Louisville.	Nationals: Wilmer Difo was recalled from Triple-A Syracuse and started in CF for the injured Michael Taylor. RHP A.J. Cole was optioned to Syracuse.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: LHP Brandon Finnegan (left shoulder soreness) made his third rehabilitation start Wednesday and appears close to coming off the DL.	Nationals: Taylor was held out of the starting lineup for a second straight game with an undisclosed injury. Baker refused to offer details, saying, "It's none of your business" and "the opposition doesn't need to know where." Taylor pinch hit in the 10th. ... OF Jayson Werth (foot contusion) is out of the walking boot and "making pretty good progress," Baker said. Werth's rehabilitation involves being in the pool, causing Baker to note: "He pulled his hair back and I wondered if he had any gills yet. He's swimming a lot. I told him he's starting to look like Michael Phelps."	UP NEXT	Reds: RHP Homer Bailey (elbow surgery) comes off the 60-day DL on Saturday to make his first start in the majors since last August. He allowed two runs over 16 2/3 innings in three rehabilitation starts.	Nationals: Joe Ross (3-3, 5.98 ERA) makes his second career start against the Reds.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

BOSTON --  David Ortiz became one of the most celebrated players in Red Sox history during his storied 14-year run in Boston.	On the night he returned to Fenway to have his No. 34 take its place among the franchise's other legends, his former teammates did their part to make sure it was a memorable one.	Hanley Ramirez and Sandy Leon hit two-run homers and the Boston Red Sox beat the Los Angeles Angels 9-4 on Friday to cap a night in which Ortiz's number became the latest retired at Fenway Park.	It was the 250th career home run for Ramirez, a good friend of Ortiz who was also born in the Dominican Republic. Leon finished with three hits and four RBI.	Ramirez said he played with Ortiz on his mind.	"He's my mentor, my big brother. He's everything," Ramirez said. "Today when I saw him on the field crying, it made me cry."	He said his home run was in Big Papi's honor.	"Definitely, definitely, definitely," he said. "I was going to do his thing (pointing his hands in the air) but I forgot."	The homers helped provide a nice cushion for Rick Porcello (4-9), who gave up four runs and struck out eight in 6 1/3 innings to earn the victory. It was the 13th straight start Porcello has gone at least six innings.	"It was vintage Porcello," Red Sox manager John Farrell said. "A couple of pitches that cut his night short, but he was crisp throughout."	This could serve as a needed confidence boost for Porcello, who had been 0-4 with a 7.92 ERA in his previous five starts, allowing 47 hits and 27 earned runs.	He had command of his pitches early, holding the Angels scoreless until the fourth, when a catching error by Leon at home allowed Albert Pujols to cross the plate.	Porcello said he isn't sure if he has completely turned a corner yet after his slow start, but he has felt better in his recent starts.	"Today was a step in the right direction," he said.	Alex Meyer (3-4) allowed five runs and five hits in 3 1/3 innings.	Los Angeles scored three runs in the seventh, but cooled off after Porcello left.	Boston got out to a 3-0 lead in the first inning, scoring on an RBI double by Xander Bogaerts and then getting two more runs off wild pitches by Meyer.	Ramirez gave Porcello a 5-1 lead in the fourth with his two-run shot to right field.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: INF Josh Rutledge was a pregame scratch with left hip soreness. Dustin Pedroia, who was only expected to play on an emergency basis, returned to the lineup a day earlier than expected after missing three straight games with a bruised back.	SLOW START	Meyer said he felt like the back-to-back walks he surrendered to the Red Sox first two hitters set a tone for his night.	"It's unacceptable," he said. "You can't go out there and put two guys on basically before the game starts."	Manager Mike Scioscia said he thinks he was too amped up, but Meyer disagreed.	"I didn't feel like my heart was ever racing," he said.	But he said he must avoid get behind the leadoff hitter 3-0, like he did against Mookie Betts Friday.	"It's really not acceptable you just have to be better than that," he said.	HONORING PAPI	Ortiz wiped away tears from his eyes as the Fenway crowd serenaded him with chants of "Papi! Papi! Papi! during the pregame ceremony to retire his No. 34.	Pedroia addressed the Fenway crowd on behalf of Ortiz's former teammates during the ceremony and said his impact stretched beyond their experiences together on the baseball field.	"You're not a friend, you're not a teammate, you're our family," Pedroia said.	UP NEXT	Angels: RHP JC Ramirez will be making his 14th start of the season and seventh on the road in 2017. He made four relief appearances last season against Boston. He's tossed 2 1/3 scoreless innings in two career games at Fenway.	Red Sox: LHP David Price held the Angels to eight scoreless innings the last time he faced them in late July last season. He is 5-5 with a 3.26 ERA over 13 career starts against Los Angeles.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	---	Follow Kyle Hightower on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/khightower	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

CLEVELAND --  The Minnesota Twins finally found a way to beat the Cleveland Indians.	Adalberto Mejia combined with three relievers on a four-hitter, leading the Twins to a 5-0 victory in a matchup of the top two teams in the AL Central on Friday night.	Mejia (2-3) held Cleveland to two hits in five innings, but had to work around five walks and two errors. The left-hander got out of bases-loaded jams in the second and fourth and stranded nine Indians runners on base.	"Adalberto probably had the most stressful five-inning, two-hit shutout that I've seen in some time," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.	Cleveland was coming off a 7-1 road trip, including a four-game sweep at Target Field last weekend that gave the Indians first place in the division. The Twins are now 1 1/2 back.	"This obviously shows we can beat them, that they're not unbeatable," Mejia said.	Tyler Duffey, Taylor Rogers and Trevor Hildenberger combined to pitch the final four innings.	Jorge Polanco's two-run homer highlighted Minnesota's four-run second off Trevor Bauer (6-6) and gave the Twins only their third win in 11 games against the Indians this season. Brian Dozier was 3 for 4 with two RBI.	The Indians scored five or more runs and recorded 10 or more hits in nine straight games, but stranded 11 runners and were 0 for 8 with runners in scoring position.	"For not a lot of hits, we had baserunners it seemed like the first five innings," Indians manager Terry Francona said. "Every inning. And good chances. Weren't able to do anything with it."	Mejia, who struck out four, retired the side in order just once -- in the fifth. He didn't allow a hit until Lonnie Chisenhall's slow roller toward third base to start the fourth. Daniel Robertson singled with one out and Mejia couldn't handle Jason Kipnis' tapper to the mound for an error that loaded the bases.	Erik Gonzalez, who struck out to end the second, whiffed again for the second out and Francisco Lindor lined out to left.	Indians third baseman Jose Ramirez wasn't in the starting lineup despite a 10-game hitting streak that raised his average to .321. He grounded out as pinch hitter to end the game against Hildenberger, who was making his major league debut.	Ramirez was 1 for 4 on Thursday, ending his streak of nine consecutive games with at least two hits.	NICE BOUNCE BACK	No one would blame the Twins for being tired in the series opener. Thursday's game against the Chicago White Sox was delayed at the start for 4 hours, 50 minutes by rain. The Twins' 9-0 loss then lasted 3:21.	TAKE A BREAK	Despite grounding out in the ninth, Ramirez is batting .511 (24 for 47) in his last 11 games. With the Indians playing 22 games in 20 days, Francona wanted to give Ramirez a rest.	"You could tell he was dragging," Francona said. "The last couple of days I think he knew he needed one, but he was swinging the bat so well. It's a good day to do it for him, let him get his legs back under him."	RELAX, KID	Hildenberger had his contract purchased from Triple-A Rochester prior to the game. "As soon as the call was made to the bullpen, my stomach dropped," he said. "But as soon as I got on the mound, I immediately calmed down."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Twins: 3B Miguel Sano (sinus infection) was not in the lineup after his symptoms worsened during the team flight. He's 2 for 23 in his career against Bauer.	Indians: OF Michael Brantley (sprained right ankle) ran on the treadmill Friday. He's eligible to come off the 10-day DL on Monday.	UP NEXT	Twins: RHP Kyle Gibson allowed three runs in six innings in a 5-2 loss to Cleveland on June 18. He is 0-3 with a 6.55 ERA in his last four starts against the Indians.	Indians: RHP Corey Kluber posted his fifth career shutout in his last start, striking out a season-high 11 in a 12-0 victory at Baltimore.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

MIAMI --  The Marlins aren't hitting, and they're still winning.	Giancarlo Stanton hit a 458-foot drive for his 19th home run, Jose Urena scattered five hits over six innings and Miami topped the Chicago Cubs 2-0 on Friday night.	The Marlins managed only three hits in the win, which came two days after getting just two hits in a 2-1 victory over Washington. Before this week, the Marlins were 0-21 this season when scoring two runs or fewer.	"It's good to know that sometimes our pitching can carry us," Stanton said.	Christian Yelich added a sacrifice fly for the Marlins. Stanton had two hits and Dee Gordon the other for Miami, while everyone else in the Marlins' lineup was a combined 0 for 19.	"That was a different game, huh? Stupid baseball," a pleased Marlins manager Don Mattingly said. "Just a well-pitched game both ways."	Urena (6-2) won his fifth straight decision. A.J. Ramos pitched the ninth for his 11th save in 12 chances.	Javier Baez and Ian Happ each had two hits for the Cubs. John Lackey (5-8) gave up just three hits and two runs -- one earned -- in six innings, yet still fell to 1-5 in his last seven starts.	It was Miami's fifth shutout win of the season, and the Cubs' sixth time being blanked.	"Johnny Lackey was really good," Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. "I was impressed with him tonight. His stuff was really sharp. He was outstanding. I didn't want to take him out of the game. The fastball had really good carry. He was throwing it where he wanted to. His slider was good."	Stanton's third-inning homer over the side of the Red Grooms sculpture in center opened the scoring, and Gordon scored Miami's second run in the sixth. He stole second, went to third on a throwing error by catcher Miguel Montero and scored easily on Yelich's fly.	That was more than enough for Urena.	His only real brush with trouble came in the fifth when he froze Addison Russell with a breaking ball near the top of the zone for an inning-ending strikeout that stranded two Cubs. Urena celebrated by giving his glove a congratulatory slap as he headed to Miami's dugout.	"The guy today went up to 100 mph with sink," Cubs third baseman Kris Bryant said. "You kind of have to know to hit certain pitches."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: RHP Kyle Hendicks (right hand), who hasn't pitched since June 4, is believed to be nearing a return -- though the Cubs have not set a definitive target date.	Marlins: 3B Martin Prado (right hamstring) returned to the lineup after missing nearly seven weeks. To make room, the Marlins designated INF Christian Colon for assignment. Prado made a nifty play in the seventh, barehanding a bunt attempt by former University of Miami standout Jon Jay and getting the ball to first in plenty of time for the out. Prado also started a game-ending 5-4-3 double play.	LACKEY'S HOMERS	The home run to Stanton was the 21st allowed by Lackey this season, two shy of his 2016 total. Eighteen have been solo. He matched a career-worst by allowing at least one home run in eight consecutive starts, something he also did while with the Angels in 2008.	CUBS LINEUP	The Cubs, never shy about mixing up lineups, had one .300 hitter in the order on Friday -- and batted him last. Jay came into the day hitting .323 and was slotted No. 9, one spot behind Lackey. Anthony Rizzo remained in the leadoff spot for the 10th consecutive game.	ALMOST THERE	Urena hasn't logged more than six innings in any start this season. He went out to start the seventh, but was relieved by RHP Kyle Barraclogh before the inning began when the Cubs sent pinch-hitter Mark Zagunis to the plate -- marking the second big league game for Zagunis.	UP NEXT	Miami LHP Justin Nicolino (0-1, 5.06) faces the Cubs for the first time in his career, when he goes up against LHP Jon Lester (4-4, 3.83) on Saturday afternoon.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Everyone in Tampa Bay's lineup didn't have a hit or drive in a run. It just seemed that way during another tough outing for Baltimore's struggling pitchers.	Evan Longoria and Shane Peterson drove in four runs apiece, Logan Morrison slugged his 22nd homer, and the surging Rays beat the reeling Orioles 15-5 for their fifth win in six games on Friday night.	"Everybody seemed to find a way to connect with the baseball," Rays manager Kevin Cash said after his team rocked starter Ubaldo Jimenez (2-3) for nine runs in 2⅓ innings.	Peterson and Derek Norris hit two-run homers as Orioles pitchers allowed at least five runs for the 20th consecutive game, tying a major league record set by the 1924 Philadelphia Phillies.	"It's not easy coming to the stadium every day knowing that you're going to be struggling," said Jimenez, who walked the first two batters he faced to set the tone for a long night.	"I know we're all expecting things are going to end one of these days. It just can't keep happening," the 33-year-old right-hander added. "The only thing we can do is keep being positive and fight every day."	Longoria had a two-run single during Tampa Bay's four-run first inning, and Peterson and Norris both went deep in the third to chase Jimenez, who walked four and yielded seven hits in his shortest appearance of the season.	"Pretty much I didn't have anything. The fastball wasn't sinking at all, the breaking ball wasn't there," Jimenez said. "I just got hit."	Chris Archer (6-4) wasn't especially sharp for Tampa Bay but the right-hander didn't have to be with the Rays posting a season-high for runs.	Jonathan Schoop and Trey Mancini each drove in two runs off the Tampa Bay starter, who allowed five runs and eight hits over six innings.	Rookie reliever Austin Pruitt inherited a 14-5 lead and pitched the final three innings for his first big league save.	The Orioles fell to 6-14 over a dubious stretch that has seen them allow 10 or more runs six times. The Rays scored five runs on one hit -- Norris' infield single -- in the fifth inning, and Jimenez's ERA jumped from 6.25 to 7.26 during his shortest outing of the season.	Baltimore manager Buck Showalter rejoined the team after missing one game while attending the birth of his first grandchild. He remains at a loss to explain the pitching woes.	"The help's got to come from within," Showalter said, noting the Orioles finished with 11 hits, the same number as the Rays. "They earned some things and we made some things easy for them, obviously."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: RHP Darren O'Day (shoulder) was reinstated from the 10-day DL. ... CF Adam Jones, who has missed time with a sore hip, was back in the lineup after being rested Thursday. Friday's game began a stretch of six straight games on artificial turf for Baltimore.	Rays: SS Matt Duffy, who had his rehab assignment for offseason Achilles tendon surgery shut down due to heel soreness, had a pea-sized calcium deposit removed this week. ... OF Colby Rasmus was placed on the 10-day DL with left hip tendinitis.	HELP ON THE WAY	Cash said there is a "good chance" C Wilson Ramos (right knee surgery) and RHP Brad Boxberger (flexor mass strain) will return from the DL this weekend. Neither has played a big league game this season.	UP NEXT	Orioles RHP Dylan Bundy (7-6) and Rays rookie RHP Jake Faria (3-0) are Saturday's starters. According to Baseball Reference, Faria is the fifth pitcher since 1913 to go at least six innings, allow one or fewer runs and get the win in his first three career starts.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

ATLANTA --  Braves manager Brian Snitker couldn't believe how quickly 23-year-old shortstop Dansby Swanson took control of a tough situation in ninth inning.	"That play Dansby made -- I'm not sure I've ever seen anything like that," Snitker said. "That ball's up the middle, and you go to third base. To have the guts to make that play is the biggest thing to me."	Mike Foltynewicz won his fourth straight decision at home, Swanson made a pair of outstanding defensive plays in the ninth inning and Atlanta beat the Milwaukee Brewers 5-4 on Friday night for its sixth win in seven games.	Eric Thames doubled leading off the ninth, and Domingo Santana hit a two-hopper to the second-base side of Swanson, who spun and threw out Thames at third.	Swanson, the front of his uniform covered in dirt from a busy night, pumped his fist after Johan Camargo reached up to catch the ball and tag out Thames, who slid headfirst.	"I was just thinking about a play kind of like that and just trying to be aggressive," said Swanson, the No. 1 overall draft pick two years ago. "It's just kind of crazy how you can process something before it happens and when it does happen, it just kind of becomes a reaction."	Travis Shaw flied out to the left-field warning track as Santana advanced, and Manny Pina lined out to Swanson, who made a diving backhand catch in the shortstop hole, for the final out.	Camargo had gone to a knee for a backhand stab of pinch-hitter Jesus Aguilar's hard-hit grounder in the eighth and threw to second base, starting an inning-ending double play.	"The ball Aguilar hit was a great double play, and the play that Domingo hit, that's a really nice play," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. "Most shortstops are throwing that ball to first base."	Foltynewicz (5-5) gave up one run, four hits and three walks in five innings with nine strikeouts, improving to 4-0 with a 2.17 ERA in his last five starts at SunTrust Park.	Brandon Phillips homered and drove in two runs, and Arodys Vizcaino earned his first save since last June 26 against the New York Mets.	Foltynewicz enjoyed some rare success against left-handed batters, who were hitting .348 against him coming in. He held Eric Sogard, Marcus Thames, Travis Shaw and switch-hitter Nick Franklin to a combined 1 for 9 with two walks and four strikeouts.	Jimmy Nelson (5-4) allowed four runs, six hits and three walks in five innings. He had gone 4-1 with a 2.24 ERA in his previous nine starts.	"We did a good job to battle back," Nelson said. "Swanson made two good plays there to help them out of that last inning."	Atlanta, which has won three straight, took a 2-0 lead in the first when Phillips homered and Tyler Flowers got an RBI on what could have been an inning-ending double-play grounder. Sogard fielded the grounder to second and flipped to shortstop Orlando Arcia, who dropped the ball. Second-base umpire Ed Hickox ruled Matt Adams out at second, but the call was overturned on video review, causing Arcia to be given an error.	Milwaukee made two errors, raising its NL-leading total to 58.	Keon Bronxton's 12th homer cut the Brewers' deficit in the fourth, but the Braves opened a 4-1 lead in the fifth when Phillips hit an RBI double and scored on Flowers' single.	Santana had an RBI single off Sam Freeman in the seventh, and Swanson singled in the run against Brent Suter in the bottom half. Arcia hit a two-run double against Jose Ramirez in the eighth.	ON THE MEND, QUICKLY	After a CT scan and meeting with Braves team physician Dr. Gary Lourie, Freddie Freeman said his broken left wrist is 80-90 percent healed, up from 50 percent last week. The improvement led Freeman to move up the timetable of his return nearly two weeks on July 6 at NL East-leading Washington. Freeman wants to play three to four games on a rehab assignment and return as the starting third baseman.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: LF Lewis Brinson was in pain after getting hit on the left hand by a fastball from Ramirez in the eighth but stayed in the game.	Braves: LF Matt Kemp was held out of the lineup to rest his left hamstring. Kemp left Thursday's 12-11 win over San Francisco after singling in eight-run fifth inning. He missed two games last weekend with a similar injury and was on the 10-day DL in April with a strained right hamstring.	UP NEXT	Brewers: RHP Matt Garza (3-3), scheduled to start Saturday, has won two of eight starts with a 4.56 ERA against Atlanta.	Braves: RHP R.A. Dickey (5-5), slated to pitch for Altanta, is 2-1 with a 3.64 ERA in four starts and two relief appearances against Milwaukee.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

CHICAGO --  Jharel Cotton told Oakland's relievers he wanted to give them some rest by pitching a complete game. Instead, the bullpen took over after his brilliant start got cut short.	Khris Davis and Matt Joyce homered, Cotton pitched three-hit ball into the sixth inning before leaving with a blister on his right thumb and the Athletics beat the Chicago White Sox 3-0 on Friday night.	Davis hit a two-run homer in the first. Joyce connected leading off the fifth against Mike Pelfrey (3-6) and the Athletics picked up the win coming off a four-game sweep by Houston.	Cotton (5-7) and four relievers combined on Oakland's second shutout of the season.	Oakland manager Bob Melvin was hopeful that Cotton would make his next scheduled start.	"When he's throwing the ball where he wants to and he's throwing all his pitches, he usually has some success," Melvin said.	Cotton gave up a leadoff single to Kevan Smith in the sixth and left after he came up shaking his hand following the first pitch to Adam Engel.	Cotton said the blister started to develop in the second inning, and he was forced to leave when his thumb started bleeding.	"I was cruising until the fifth and the sixth and then this happened," Cotton said of the blister. "It was kind of a bummer that I couldn't at least finish the sixth inning."	Liam Hendriks, Ryan Madson and Sean Doolittle each worked a scoreless inning before Santiago Casilla ran into trouble in the ninth. He allowed singles to Melky Cabrera and Jose Abreu. But with two outs, he retired Matt Davidson on a long fly to center for his 12th save in 15 chances.	Pelfrey gave up three runs and four hits in 4 2/3 innings. Chris Beck came in after he walked consecutive batters, and Avisail Garcia ended the threat when he ran down Ryon Healy's fly while crashing into the wall in the right-field corner.	RENTERIA, ANDERSON TOSSED	White Sox manager Rick Renteria and shortstop Tim Anderson were ejected by plate umpire Jim Wolf in the fifth inning after arguing that Anderson's groundout to catcher Bruce Maxwell should have been called a foul ball.	Anderson said he told Wolf the ball was foul. He also said the umpire agreed but wouldn't overturn the call.	"I told him that was (wrong). And he tossed me," Anderson said.	Anderson and Renteria also thought the umpire was a bit quick with the ejections.	"I think we should be allowed to be disagreeable without getting tossed," Renteria said. "I think it's again emotions go high for everybody including the umpires. They are out there trying to do their job."	RARE ROAD WIN	Melvin had talked before the game about the importance of getting off to a hot start away from home, as Friday was just the 10th road win of the season for the A's, the fewest in the American League.	Davis said Melvin was so happy about Davis' first-inning homer that he made a sly remark to the DH when the videoboard later showed its "Kiss Cam."	"He told me he wanted to give me a kiss for some reason because we jumped out to an early lead," Davis said. "I think I agree with that, that it was important to jump out and score first.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- ��� The Kansas City Royals had been 0-29 when trailing after eight innings. That changed Friday night.	Whit Merrifield hit a two-run, two-out double that capped a four-run rally in the ninth inning, and the Royals beat the Toronto Blue Jays 5-4 on Friday night to reach .500 for the first time since April.	"You always want to be up with the game on the line," Merrifield said. "That's why you play the game.  It's not always going to happen the way it did tonight, but it is fun when it does."	With their 10th win in 12 games, the Royals improved to 36-36. They were 6-6 before play on April 20, then went on a nine-game losing streak that night and dropped as low as 10-20, seven games out of first place. They trail AL Central-leading Cleveland by three games.	Toronto took a 2-1 lead into the ninth and extended it when Josh Donaldson and Justin Smoak hit RBI singles off Joakim Soria (4-2).	Salvador Perez doubled with one out in the bottom half against Ryan Tepera, took third on a wild pitch, and Brandon Moss walked with two outs.	Alcides Escobar greeted Aaron Loup (2-1) with an RBI single, and Alex Gordon hit a run-scoring single on the first pitch from Jason Grilli. Ahead 3-1 in the count, Merrifield doubled on a hop to the left-field wall, and Gordon scored easily from first, crossing the plate with a headfirst slide.	"It's frustrating," Blue Jays catcher Russell Martin said. "It hasn't happened too often in my career, but every time it happens it stings.  You're almost like standing there saying 'I can't believe that just happened.' But, they earned it."	The Royals have 21 comeback victories this season.	"We've said all year we have a team that is definitely capable of making a run," Moss said. "I don't think we pay attention to come-from-behind or whether we get out to a lead earlier or whatever. We're just trying to win a ball game."	Royals rookie Jake Junis gave up two runs and six hits in 6 1/3 innings. Blue Jays starter J.A. Happ allowed one run and four hits in 6 2/3 innings.	"This game can rip your heart out and tonight was one of those nights," Happ said.	Toronto opened a 2-0 lead in the fourth when Troy Tulowitzki hit an RBI double and scored on a wild pitch. Perez singled in a run in the seventh.	ROYALS MOVES	RHP Chris Young, an integral part of the Royals' 2015 World Series championship team, was designated for assignment with a 7.50 ERA in 14 appearances. The Royals signed RHP Neftali Feliz, who was released Monday by Milwaukee. He was 1-5 with a 6.00 ERA for the Brewers and eight for nine in save chances.	BLUE JAYS MOVES	Toronto selected the contract of OF Ian Parmley from Triple-A Buffalo, where he was hitting .289 with 11 stolen bases, and started him in right field. He went 0 for 3 with a sacrifice bunt in his debut. They optioned RHP Cesar Valdez to the Bisons. ... 2B Devon Travis (right knee damaged cartilage) was transferred to the 60-day DL.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: Donaldson, scratched Thursday with a sore left knee, was back at third base and went 1 for 5 with three strikeouts. ... LF Steve Pearce, who bruised his right knee banging into the wall Wednesday, did not play for the second consecutive game.	Royals: LHP Danny Duffy (right oblique strain) is to begin a minor league rehab assignment Saturday with Triple-A Omaha.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays RHP Marco Estrada and Royals LHP Jason Vargas, both Long Beach State alums, are scheduled to start Saturday.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

ST. LOUIS --  Pittsburgh Pirates super-utilityman John Jaso usually has one chance to make an impression in a game. On Friday night, he made the most of a rare second chance.	Josh Bell and Jaso homered as the Pittsburgh Pirates broke their Busch Stadium hex with a 4-3 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals.	Jaso, who entered as part of a double switch in the eighth inning, drove a 3-2 pitch from Seung Hwan Oh (1-4) over the wall in right-center to break a 3-3 tie in the ninth as the Pirates broke a seven-game losing streak in St. Louis.	The eventual game-winning homer came one pitch after Jaso checked his swing on a possible strike three, but third base umpire Alan Porter ruled Jaso's bat did not break the plane of the plate.	"I definitely held up on that swing," Jaso said. "I think it was just an intense situation so everybody was jumping around, including the crowd and everything, but, no, I didn't go."	Cardinals manager Mike Matheny thought the pitch itself was strike three.	"As I saw it with the naked eye it didn't necessarily look like it, but what I'm hearing that the strikes called showed it for a strike, but it's a strike when they call it a strike," Matheny said.	Four of Jaso's five home runs have come in the seventh inning or later and four broke ties.	"I try and keep everything exactly the same that way there's no ups and downs," Jaso said.	Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said that consistency has made Jaso into one of baseball's best pinch-hitters.	"A lot of people get caught up in the hair," Hurdle said referring to Jaso's hair style. "There's a baseball player in there. He's a free spirit but he's a very controlled free spirit as far as working well with the team."	Jameson Taillon threw 104 pitches in six innings, both highs since coming back from testicular cancer surgery on June 12. Only one of the four hits the Pirates righty allowed left the infield.	"I can be a little better about pounding the zone early in counts," Taillon said. "When I'm efficient that's where I have success just going middle down, power sink."	Felipe Rivero (3-1) pitched the Pirates out of a two-on, one-out jam in the eighth. Rivero worked around a ninth-inning walk to secure the win.	Bell's homer gave the Pirates a 1-0 lead in the top of the second. Bell's 14 home runs are the second-most by a Pirates rookie before the All-Star break since Ralph Kiner's 15 in 1946.	David Freese walked and scored to tie it 2-2 in the fourth. Freese advanced to third on a throwing error by second baseman Paul DeJong, the seventh by the Cardinals in their last three games which have led to seven unearned runs.	Freese's two-out RBI single off Trevor Rosenthal in the eighth tied the game 3-3. Freese has hit safely in 13 of 14 games against his former team.	Adam Wainwright got through seven innings for the third time this season and the first time since May 27. Only one of the two runs Wainwright allowed was earned after he had allowed 18 runs in his previous 5 1/3 innings.	Jose Martinez's two-run homer, his second in three games, gave the Cardinals a 2-1 lead in the bottom of the second.	DeJong's solo home run gave the Cardinals a 3-2 lead in the seventh. It was DeJong's fourth homer in his last seven games.	WEB GEMS	Matt Carpenter made a diving stop in the first and Tommy Pham made a diving catch in the second for the Cardinals, each saving would-be singles.	Gregory Polanco made a diving catch to start a 9-3 double play for the Pirates in the sixth.	TRAINING ROOM	Pirates: C Francisco Cervelli is on the seven-day concussion DL for the second time this month.	Cardinals: OF Dexter Fowler (quadriceps) missed his second straight game. ... C Yadier Molina was a late scratch after taking a foul tip off his knee on Thursday.	UP NEXT	Pirates: RHP Gerrit Cole (5-6, 4.28 ERA) has pitched at least six innings while allowing two earned runs or less in seven straight starts. He is 5-4 with a 2.84 ERA in 11 career starts against St. Louis.	Cardinals: RHP Lance Lynn (5-4, 3.33 ERA) has not allowed a run to Pittsburgh in his last 12 innings, including seven shutout innings on April 17. He is 4-0 with a 1.59 ERA in seven starts against NL Central opponents this season.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

NEW YORK --  Once Masahiro Tanaka and Yu Darvish got done dominating, the hitters finally had a chance.	And after midnight, Ronald Torreyes lined an RBI single with two outs in the 10th inning that sent the New York Yankees over the Texas Rangers 2-1 on Friday night for just their second win in 10 games.	"Super happy to be able to get a hit," Torreyes said through a translator. "Super happy for the outcome.	"Without Tanaka, there's no chance, we don't have a chance. He was excellent tonight. He held the game zero-zero," he said.	Brett Gardner also played a big part for the Yankees, hitting a tying home run with one out in the ninth off closer Matt Bush (2-3).	It was scoreless until the late innings as Tanaka and Darvish excelled in the first major league matchup between the Japanese stars. Tanaka pitched eight innings, Darvish was pulled after seven because of tightness in his triceps.	Darvish said he left as a precaution, adding through a translator, "I think I'm going to be fine for my next outing."	Chasen Shreve (2-1) escaped a bases-loaded jam in the top of the 10th, and Torreyes' hit kept the Yankees atop the AL East.	"We needed this," manager Joe Girardi said.	Gary Sanchez, whose passed ball gave Texas a 1-0 lead in the ninth, singled with one out in the 10th off Bush. A single by Didi Gregorius put runners at the corners and after Chris Carter struck out in his last at-bat for the Yankees, Torreyes singled to center field.	Often playfully hoisted by Gregorius in the dugout to high-five Aaron Judge after the tall slugger's home runs, the diminutive Torreyes wound up on the shoulders of his teammates.	Torreyes' first career game-ending hit came at 12:19 a.m. -- the start was delayed 1 hour, 42 minutes because of rain.	Torreyes also made two sparkling defensive plays at third base. He dived to his left to snag Shin-Soo Choo's grounder and threw from his knees to start an inning-ending double play in the third, then made a backhand stab, spun and beat Elvis Andrus with a two-hop throw to first leading off the seventh.	The Darvish-Tanaka duel didn't disappoint the big crowd in the Bronx or the national television audience tuned in Saturday morning back in their homeland.	"Breakfast at Wimbledon," Girardi mused before the game. "Breakfast at Yankee Stadium."	Darvish gave up just two singles, striking out 10 without a walk.	"I was trying to focus on my pitching," Darvish said. "I didn't watch him pitch."	Tanaka was totally in control, too, working around three singles in eight innings, fanning nine and walking two.	"I was excited going into the game but once the game starts, you're not actually going against Darvish, you're going against the Texas lineup," Tanaka said through a translator.	Tanaka retired 16 straight batters after escaping a two-on, no-out jam in the second. He stayed ahead the whole way by throwing first-pitch strikes to 25 of 27 hitters.	Despite the stellar outing, the no-decision left Tanaka at 0-6 in his last eight starts.	Judge singled in the ninth. The rookie who leads the majors in home runs has safely reached base in a career-best 25 straight games.	SO LONG	The Yankees cut Carter after the game, designating him for assignment. He tied for the NL lead with 41 home runs for Milwaukee last year, but hit only .204 with eight homers and 23 RBI this season. 1B Tyler Austin will be promoted from Triple-A.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: LHP Martin Perez ripped a finger nail off his left thumb and broke the tip of the bone in an accident at his New York hotel Thursday night. The team said it's too early to know if he'll make his next start Wednesday night at Cleveland. ... LHP Cole Hamels (right oblique) threw a bullpen session before the game. If all is OK, he could pitch Monday in Cleveland in his first big league start since April 26.	Yankees: 3B Chase Headley missed his second straight game because of back spasms. He had an epidural, and Girardi said Headley might be able to play Sunday. ... OF Jacoby Ellsbury (concussion) is taking batting practice. The team hopes he can soon begin a rehab assignment.	UP NEXT	Rangers: RHP Austin Bibens-Dirkx (2-0, 4.25 ERA) made his major league debut last month after 12 seasons in the minors. This will be his ninth game for Texas and fourth start.	Yankees: RHP Luis Cessa (0-0, 7.36) got hit hard last week by Oakland in his first start of the season.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

PHOENIX --  The postgame shower took a little longer for Mark Leiter Jr. He had assorted condiments to scrub away after a celebratory dousing from Philadelphia Phillies teammates in celebration of his first major league win Friday night.	Leiter was also in a hurry to greet his father, former big-leaguer Mark Sr., who was in attendance Friday night to see his son hold the slugging Arizona Diamondbacks to three hits over six scoreless innings. Maikel Franco and Tommy Joseph both homered in the Phillies' 6-1 victory.	Leiter struck out five with a walk in his first major league start after 12 relief appearances. He bested Diamondbacks starter Patrick Corbin (6-7), who held the Phillies to a run and eight hits for 6 2/3 innings.	Philadelphia won its second straight after five straight losses, three from being swept in a series with Arizona at home last week.	"It's something I'll never forget. I think I was probably more excited for this than I was my major league debut," Leiter said. "Trying to just trust myself and give my team the best chance I could to win and keep us in it as long as possible."	The Diamondbacks had scored 26 runs in their previous two games, both wins, and had won nine of their previous 10 games before Friday. They didn't score until Daniel Descalso's one-out triple drove in Rey Fuentes from first base in the eighth inning.	Reliever Joaquin Benoit gave up the run, but escaped further damage when David Peralta lined out to shortstop Freddy Galvis for the second out. After a walk to Paul Goldschmidt, Benoit struck out Jake Lamb to end the inning.	"They made some good defensive plays late in the game. Obviously the line drive by Peralta was a crucial moment," Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said.	Franco's solo shot came off Jorge De La Rosa in the eighth, an opposite-field home run to right that was Franco's ninth of the season.	The Phillies scored four runs off Arizona reliever T.J. McFarland in the ninth. Two hits, including Howie Kendrick's pinch-hit ground-rule double, led to Cameron Perkins' sacrifice fly, and Kendrick scored on an error.	Joseph's two-run homer landed in the pool beyond the right-field fence, his 12th of the season. Arizona lost for the just the 10th time in 36 home games.	Joseph knew the pool deck well. He had watched batting practice from there in his younger days growing up in the Phoenix area, and his home run was the first by a visiting player to land directly in the pool this season.	"That part of the ballpark is pretty deep out there," Joseph said. "It's definitely a good feeling and I'm happy to have some friends and family in the stands to enjoy it with me."	Galvis' one-out triple in the first eluded a diving attempt by Arizona right fielder Peralta, and Galvis trotted home on Aaron Altherr's grounder.	The Phillies got strong relief from Pat Neshek, who struck out the side in his lone inning. Philadelphia ended a seven-game road losing streak.	ROSTER MOVE	The Diamondbacks optioned OF Jeremy Hazelbaker to Triple-A Reno after Friday's game. He is hitting .318 (14-for-44) with a home run and six RBI in 33 games in the majors this season.	THE LEITER SIDE	Leiter, whose father pitched for the Phillies in 1997 and 1998, became part of the 15th father-son duo in major league history to make a start for the same club, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Leiter is already half of the second father-son combination ever to play for Philadelphia, and the third Phillie to make his first career big-league start this season.	DELGADO BACK IN MIX	The Diamondbacks will pull RHP Randall Delgado back out of the bullpen and give him a start on Sunday against the Phillies. But it might only be a one-time situation so as to give Taijuan Walker, who's spot Delgado is filling, some extra rest. Walker is not injured, Lovullo said.	Delgado had a rotation stint earlier this season and has made four starts.	FIRST-ROUND PITCHES	Josh Jackson, Thursday's first-round pick of the Phoenix Suns in the NBA Draft, and Haason Reddick, the Arizona Cardinals' first-round pick in the NFL Draft this year, threw out ceremonial first pitches before Friday's game. Jackson's toss was well outside.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: RHP Casey Fien was placed on the 10-day DL with a right rotator cuff strain, with Leiter called up in a corresponding move. ... Jerad Eickhoff (upper back strain) could miss more than one start, manager Pete Mackanin said. Eickhoff went on the DL June 20.	Diamondbacks: C-OF Chris Herrmann is dealing with a sore hand and got Friday off. He's set to start on Saturday. ... OF A.J. Pollock (groin strain) is scheduled to play in a rehab game on Sunday provided his workout goes smoothly on Saturday. ... Reliever J.J. Hoover was placed on the 10-day DL with right shoulder inflammation, and RHP Rubby De La Rosa was called up from Triple-A Reno on Friday. C Oscar Hernandez was designated for assignment.	UP NEXT	Phillies: RHP Ben Lively (1-1, 3.33 ERA) will be making his second career start against Arizona on Saturday.	Diamondbacks: LHP Robbie Ray (7-3) is set to face the Phillies on Saturday. He is 5-0 with a 1.06 ERA and 55 strikeouts over his last six starts. He is 1-1 in his career against the Phillies.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SEATTLE --  Felix Hernandez was anxious for his opportunity to be back on the mound pitching for Seattle for the first time in nearly two months. It helped the Mariners' offense made sure Hernandez didn't need to worry about being perfect.	Hernandez pitched six solid innings in his first start since late April and was backed by home runs from Mike Zunino, Ben Gamel and Kyle Seager in the Mariners' 13-3 win over the Houston Astros on Friday night.	A day after climbing over .500 for the first time this season, the Mariners continued their June surge with their sixth straight win thanks to an offense that knocked out Houston starter Joe Musgrove (4-7) early and got a strong performance from Hernandez.	"This lineup is a little scary," Hernandez said.	Jarrod Dyson's RBI double in the second got Seattle started, but it was a six-run third inning that blew the game open. Danny Valencia's two-run single dribbled past the diving attempt of Alex Bregman and two batters later Zunino hit a three-run shot for his 10th home run of the season.	All of Zunino's homers have come since being recalled from Triple-A on May 23, and he has 29 RBI in June -- just four short of the franchise record for any month.	"Our guys have a lot of confidence right now, they feel good walking to the plate, and no pressure on anybody," Seattle manager Scott Servais said. "I think that's what happens when a whole lineup is kind of moving together really well."	Gamel led off the fourth inning with his fourth homer and Seager followed later in the inning with his eighth, helping end Musgrove's miserable night. The Houston right-hander lasted just 3 2/3 innings, allowing 12 hits and nine earned runs, both new career-highs.	"They were all over everything," Musgrove said. "There were even times when I threw good pitches, I had a lot of swing-and-misses tonight, a few good strikes, but every time I made a good two-strike, put-away pitch they laid it out like they knew what was coming. I made too many mistakes in the zone."	Houston manager A.J. Hinch was not pleased by having to turn to his bullpen early and adding more innings to their workload.	"We can't keep absorbing that many innings in the bullpen," Hinch said.	Hernandez (3-2) wasn't great but didn't need to be getting the kind of run support that's been rare during his career. Pitching for the first time since April 25, Hernandez gave up a pair of solo home runs to Bregman and Jose Altuve, but walked just one batter and pitched out of the one major jam he faced. Houston had runners at the corners with one out when Hernandez struck out Yuli Gurriel and got Bregman to fly out.	Hernandez struck out eight, and Yovani Gallardo picked up the save pitching the final three innings in his first relief appearance since 2007.	"I was going crazy when I was on the DL. I knew I was going to come back," Hernandez said.	VENEZUELAN LEADER	Hernandez passed his good friend Freddy Garcia with his 157th victory, the most by a Venezuelan-born pitcher.	WILD INNING	Seattle added three runs in the seventh inning, all scoring on wild pitches from Houston's James Hoyt. Two scored on one play as Brian McCann struggled to locate the ball, allowing Valencia and Dyson to score. Pinch-runner Taylor Motter scored later in the inning on another spiked pitch.	ROSTER SHUFFLE	Astros: LHP Reymin Guduan was recalled from Triple-A Fresno on Friday and threw two innings of relief allowing just one hit. Houston optioned RHP Dayan Diaz.	Mariners: To clear a roster spot for Hernandez, RHP Andrew Moore was sent back to the minors after a successful major league debut on Thursday. Moore allowed three runs in seven innings to get the victory against Detroit. Because of off days, the Mariners won't need a fifth starter for at least a week. Moore will stay on turn in the minors and is expected to rejoin the club when a fifth starter is needed.

He was the AL pitcher of the month in May after going 4-0 with a 0.99 ERA.	Mariners: Sam Gaviglio (3-1) will make his eighth start. Gaviglio got a no decision in his last outing throwing five innings and allowed two earned runs.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

LOS ANGELES --  Much like the Los Angeles Dodgers, left-hander Alex Wood is on some kind of roll.	Wood kept his record perfect and the streaking Dodgers defeated the NL West rival Colorado Rockies 6-1 on Friday night for their eighth consecutive victory.	Los Angeles has won 14 of its last 15 games.	"We're really rolling right now," Wood said. "It's going to be tough for anyone to come in here right now."	The Dodgers have scored at least six runs in each of their last seven games.	"They're on a nice roll," Rockies manager Bud Black said. "They're swinging the bats and Wood's been throwing the ball very well. So you know you're in for a tough task.	"We're aware of what's going on. They're also aware of what's going on with us. They just outpitched us tonight."	The Rockies have lost three consecutive games and surrendered their lead in the NL West to the Dodgers. They trail Los Angeles by 2 1/2 games.	Wood (8-0) went six innings for the Dodgers and could have gone without allowing a run if left-fielder Franklin Gutierrez had not been so slow to try and cut off a Tom Murphy hit. The ball rolled by him for a double to score Raimel Tapia from first in the second inning.	Wood did not allow another hit after the second. He gave up three hits on the night, walked two, retired his last 10 batters and lowered his ERA to 1.86.	"He's just been really aggressive," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. "He just fills up the strike zone, a three-pitch mix, and these guys just weren't really getting good swings."	Rookie left-hander Kyle Freeman (8-4) allowed five runs and a career-high 10 hits and three walks in six innings.	"He hung in there, put a couple zeros on the board, which was good to see," Black said. "I'm sure he'd like to have a couple pitches back."	Yasiel Puig hit a solo home run of Freeland in the fourth. The Dodgers have homered in 15 consecutive games, tied for fourth-longest streak in club history. The last time was in 1977; their record is 24 consecutive.	SEAGER DOWN	Shortstop Corey Seager left the game after scoring in the second inning with what the Dodgers hope is a right hamstring cramp. He is scheduled to undergo more tests and Roberts said he was unlikely to play Saturday.	Seager said he's had hamstring issues twice to each leg and did not believe this one was serious.	"Getting him out of there was the prudent decision," Roberts said.	FREELAND BATTLES	Despite the Dodgers hitting Freeland around some, Black was happy with the way his rookie hung tough in just his 15th career start.	"He's a great competitor," Black said. "That's what we love about Kyle. He battles. He's a fierce competitor. Great for a young guy. Each start he makes he's learning, getting better."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rockies: OF Carlos Gonzalez missed the series opener against the Dodgers. Said Black: "A little bit of a sore shoulder. It's day-to-day." . RHP Chad Qualls (lower back spasms) threw 17 pitches in a bullpen session. Said Black: "He's feeling great. He threw a bullpen and felt good." Qualls can come off the DL on Wednesday.	Dodgers: Placed RHP Chris Hatcher on the 10-day DL with mid-back inflammation. Hatcher, 32, has appeared in 26 games, going 0-1 with a 4.66 ERA. The Dodgers recalled RHP Ross Stripling from Triple-A Oklahoma City to take his roster spot.	UP NEXT	Rockies: RHP Tyler Chatwood (6-7, 4.08 ERA) has a 2.41 ERA on the road, fourth-best in the NL. Has gone 3-1 with a 1.41 ERA in his last five road starts. In one start against the Dodgers this year on May 12, allowed five runs and six hits in 4 1/3 innings.	Dodgers: Despite picking up the victory, LHP Clayton Kershaw (10-2, 2.61) had one of his roughest starts of the season in his last outing against the Mets. He allowed six runs and six hits, four of them home runs. He has already allowed a career-high 17 home runs.	---	https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

SAN DIEGO --  Luis Perdomo's first scoreless outing of the season came at a great time for the San Diego Padres.	Perdomo (2-4) pitched two-hit ball over six innings, Austin Hedges had an RBI double and the Padres handed the Detroit Tigers their seventh straight loss, 1-0 on Friday night.	Having allowed at least one run in each of his starts, Perdomo outworked Detroit's Michael Fulmer and did not allow a hit until the fifth. Perdomo struck out six and walked five.	"I was able to make that adjustment, and luckily I was able to make it early on, early enough in the game that it was able to keep me in the game and make some pitches tonight," Perdomo said. "As you saw early on I was a little bit out of control with my mechanics and I was allowing those walks early on but then I was able to get a feel for it and make that adjustment in the game, which kept me in there."	Hedges doubled to the right-center gap in the second to drive home Cory Spangenberg, who reached base three times against Fulmer (6-6). It was Hedges' first at-bat since a collision at home plate with the Cubs' Anthony Rizzo that sidelined the catcher for two games.	"I was just looking for a mistake and he gave it to me," Hedges said. "His stuff is really good, as you can tell. Everything's hard and sharp"	Perdomo walked four batters in the first three innings, but twice escaped with double-play grounders to keep Detroit off the board.	"He was missing kind of wild the first couple of innings," Green said. "I thought he did a really good job adjusting as the game went on."	Brad Hand pitched a scoreless eighth and Brandon Maurer retired the side in the ninth for his 14th save.	Fulmer allowed one run on two hits over seven innings. He struck out eight and walked four. In Detroit's six shutout losses this season, Fulmer has been the starting pitcher in three.	"It's tough," Fulmer said. "It just seems we are in one of those stretches where nothing seems to go our way. Anything border-line is going against us right now. But, we just have to grind through and stick with it. I still believe in these guys in the clubhouse. I think everybody does."	Justin Upton went hitless in his return to San Diego, where he played the 2015 season.	"I'm just trying to have good at-bats and square a few balls up," Upton said. "It just didn't go our way. Our pitching did a great job, we just couldn't scratch one across."	EJECTED	Manager Brad Ausmus was ejected from the game for arguing a swinging strike call by first base umpire Jordan Baker.	"It was probably because of my emotion concerning the call he made," Ausmus said. "I wasn't real happy with the call of a check swing. I didn't think he went, and I still don't think he went after watching the replay."	QUOTABLE	"In the last week, we have not hit some relatively unknown pitchers," Ausmus said. "It doesn't mean they're not good or didn't have good games, they're just not household names."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: INF Nicholas Castellanos was scratched from the starting lineup with lower back tightness. ... Placed OF Alex Presley on the 7-day concussion disabled list. ... Recalled RHP Bruce Rondon from Triple-A Toledo.	Padres: INF Yangervis Solarte was placed on the 10-day disabled list with a strained left oblique. ... RHP Miguel Diaz went on the 10-day disabled list with a strained right forearm, ... Reinstated C Hector Sanchez from the 10-day disabled list and recalled INF Carlos Asuaje from Triple-A El Paso. ... OF Alex Dickerson will have back surgery and is expected to miss the remainder of the season.	UP NEXT	Tigers: RHP Anibal Sanchez (0-0, 7.90) takes the mound in the second game of the series. Sanchez will be making his second start of the season after pitching predominantly out of the bullpen for Detroit and following a stint in Triple-A Toledo.	Padres: Rookie RHP Dinelson Lamet (2-2, 7.50) will make the start for San Diego, following a career-high 12 strikeout performance last time out in Milwaukee.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Once they took the field, a little bit of controversy didn't seem the bother the New York Mets.	On a day when unhappy veteran shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera asked to be traded, the slumping Mets broke out their bats.	Yoenis Cespedes had three hits including a two-run homer and Lucas Duda had three hits including a solo blast as the New York Mets defeated the San Francisco Giants 11-4 on Friday night.	Cabrera earlier voiced his disappointment with being moved to second base on the day he came off the disabled list with a thumb injury.	"I'm not worried about the attitude of our club," Mets manager Terry Collins said. "Today was an unfortunate situation but as I said before the game, we'll get through it and we got through it."	The win snapped the Mets' four-game losing streak. They had lost seven of eight.	The Giants have lost 10 of their last 11 games, 12 of their last 14 and 19 of their last 24.	Along with Cespedes and Duda, Cabrera, Wilmer Flores and Michael Conforto all had three hits as the Mets finished with 20.	Seth Lugo (2-1) won for the third time in his last four starts. He gave up four runs in 5 2/3 innings and was 1 for 2 with one RBI.	Gorkys Hernandez hit a two-out, two-run single in the bottom of the sixth off Lugo that spoiled his bid for a fifth straight quality start.	"It always makes it easier when your offense can put up numbers like that," Lugo said. "I was a little disappointed with myself for walking a couple in the sixth with a nine-run lead, that's something I need to get better at."	Cespedes' ninth homer of the season highlighted a six-run second inning in which the Mets sent 10 batters to the plate.	In 13 games since coming off the disabled list Cespedes is 17 for 43 with seven extra-base hits including three home runs.	He's 8 for 18 with three home runs in his last four games at AT&T Park going back to last season.	Ty Blach (4-5) gave up seven runs in three innings. He's 0-3 with a 6.84 ERA in his last five starts.	"I thought I threw a few good pitches that they hit but I made a lot of mistakes and they got hit pretty hard," Blach said. "When I leave the ball up, usually I'm too quick on the back side."	Cabrera was activated from the disabled list and inserted into the New York Mets' starting lineup at second base rather than shortstop and he said he wants to be traded. Cabrera had three hits Friday night.	The 31-year-old, a two-time All-Star and a veteran of 11 big league seasons, had not started at second since Sept. 28, 2014. The Mets started Jose Reyes at shortstop against San Francisco on Friday night and Wilmer Flores at third.	TRANSACTIONS:	Mets: Second-round draft selection Mark Vientos signed out of high school for a $1.5 million signing bonus. The infielder was the 59th overall selection in this year's draft. . The Mets also signed their third- and fifth-round picks, OF Quinn Brodey and 1B/OF Matt Winaker (both from Stanford). . Brodey signed for a $500,000 bonus and Winaker for $280,000.	Giants: LHP Bryan Morris was designated for assignment and Steven Okert was called up from Triple-A Sacramento.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Giants: LHP Madison Bumgarner (separated left shoulder) threw 45 pitches in a simulated game on Wednesday at the team's spring training complex in Scottsdale, Arizona. . Utilityman Eduardo Nunez went on the 10-day DL with a hamstring injury. The Giants activated 3B Conor Gillaspie (back spasms).	UP NEXT	Mets RHP Jacob deGrom (6-3, 394 ERA) has allowed one earned run over 17 innings in his last two starts. He's 3-1 with a 3.62 ERA in five career starts against the Giants. San Francisco RHP Johnny Cueto (5-7, 4.42) is 1-6 with a 4.13 ERA in his last nine starts. He's 4-4 with a 3.75 ERA in 12 career starts against the Mets.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.
