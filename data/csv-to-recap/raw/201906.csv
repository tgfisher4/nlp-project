ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Charlie Morton is proving his worth to the Tampa Bay Rays.	The 35-year-old right-hander, signed to a $30 million, two-year contract in free agency, remained unbeaten with his new team on Monday night, limiting the Oakland Athletics to two hits over seven shutout innings of a 6-2 victory.	The win, Tampa Bay's sixth in seven games, nudged the Rays ahead of the New York Yankees for first place in the AL East.	Morton (8-0, 2.10 ERA) is one of the reasons the budget-minded team with one of baseball's lowest payrolls feels this could be a special season.	"He's a huge pickup for this team," centerfielder Kevin Kiermaier said after making a leaping catch at the wall to rob Oakland's Jurickson Profar of an extra-base hit and then delivering a two-run homer for a 4-0 lead in the seventh inning.	"The way Charlie Morton has been going for us all year, the spark and dominance he has brought to the table," Kiermaier added, "I wanted to make that play for him."	Brandon Lowe homered for the third time in two days, snapping a scoreless tie in the sixth inning and helping the Rays take a half-game lead over Yankees, who were rained out at home where they were to play the Mets.	Morton (8-0) extended his career-best winning streak to 11 games dating to Aug. 17, when he was with the Houston Astros.	The stretch covers 21 starts -- 14 of them with Tampa Bay since signing as a free agent -- and is the longest active streak in the major leagues ahead of Milwaukee Davies, who's 7-0 over his past 14 starts.	Morton allowed two hits -- singles to Marcus Semien in the first and third innings -- and retired the last 14 batters he faced. In addition to Kiermaier's highlight-reel catch, Morton benefited from Tommy Pham also making a leaping catch at the wall in left field.	"I'm not surprised by it anymore. They are awesome," Morton said of the defensive gems. "You get so much confidence in the guys behind you. I feel like if a ball is hit really, really hard, you still have a chance with those guys out there."	Stephen Piscotty ruined Tampa Bay's bid for a shutout, driving in Mark Canha with an RBI double and then scoring on Robbie Grossman's run-scoring single in the ninth.	Lowe, who homered twice in Sunday's 6-1 win in Boston, hit a two-run shot off Tanner Anderson (0-1), who was promoted from Triple-A Las Vegas to make his debut with Oakland, which acquired him from Pittsburgh last November.	Kiermaier also had a two-run homer for Tampa Bay, going deep against reliever Yusmeiro Petit in the seventh inning. Ji-Man Choi made it 6-0 with a two-run homer off Joakim Soria in the eighth.	Anderson, who went to high school in nearby Tampa, made six relief appearances for the Pirates last season. He allowed two runs and three hits over 5 2/3 innings in his first big league start.	"My first dream was to play at this level, and it was awesome when that happened last year," said Anderson, who had 40 family members and friends in the stands.	"But my second dream is to pitch in Tropicana (Field), so it was awesome," Anderson added. "A dream come true. Had a lot of support here, which is really cool."	CHEAP SEATS	Attendance was announced as 16,091, a figure helped in part by the Rays putting 5,000 tickets on sale for $5 apiece last week.	The discounted tickets, available on the internet for a limited time, were made available as part of a flash sale, including the first five dates of a seven-game homestand that began Monday.	The allotment for two of the games -- against the Los Angeles Angels on Thursday and Friday -- sold out before last week's deadline.	The Rays entered Monday night averaging 13,802 -- 29th among 30 major league teams.	HONEYWELL UPDATE	Rays pitching prospect Brent Honeywell underwent successful surgery to repair the fracture in his right elbow. The operation was performed by Dr. James Andrews in Pensacola, Florida. The team said ulnar collateral ligament was not damaged and that if Honeywell's recovery goes as hoped, the right-hander could resume throwing next January. Honeywell has been sidelined from the spring of 2018, recovering from Tommy John surgery.	TRAVEL WOES	The Athletics spent an extra 3 1/2 hours in the clubhouse after Sunday's game at Texas and didn't arrive in Florida until after 3 a.m. because their plane was damaged during a thunderstorm. That followed an early morning arrival Friday for a four-game series with the Rangers that included a day-night doubleheader Saturday and a rain delay Sunday. "Feels like we've had five straight nights of naps," manager Bob Melvin said.	UP NEXT	Athletics RHP Mike Fiers (5-3) will start the middle date of the three-game series Tuesday night. Opener Ryne Stanek (0-1) will take the ball first for the Rays.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

PHILADELPHIA -- The Arizona Diamondbacks got to play Home Run Derby in Philly.	The Diamondbacks hit three straight home runs to open the game and finished with a team-record eight in a 13-8 win over the Philadelphia Phillies in a homer-happy game on Monday night.	Scott Kingery hit two of Philadelphia's five home runs for the combined MLB record of 13 homers in one game, passing the previous mark of 12 by the White Sox-Tigers in 1995 and again by the White Sox-Tigers in 2002.	On most nights, five would be enough to win a game. But not this one in steamy Philly, where the Diamondbacks turned their at-bats into extended batting practice. Jarrod Dyson, Ketel Marte and David Peralta hit the dinger, tater and long ball all in a row off Jerad Eickhoff in the first inning to get the record romp rolling.	"With the way we've been swinging the bats, you never know," Dyson said. "We're just trying to keep that going."	The Diamondbacks kept it going, going, gone. Eduardo Escobar became the first Diamondback to homer from different sides of the plate in consecutive innings. Ildemaro Vargas also homered twice, Alex Avila went deep and the Diamondbacks made the Citizens Bank Park outfield seats the place to be for a souvenir.	Well, at least for the fans who wanted one -- an angry Phillies fanatic hurled one homer back on the field.	Eickhoff (3-4) allowed two more two-run homers before he was chased in the fourth inning with the Diamondbacks up 7-3. The Diamondbacks hit two more homers for a team-record seven in a game and added another to set the new mark at eight.	Eickhoff allowed five hits in three-plus inning -- all the hits homers -- and Arizona won its fifth straight game.	"Home runs happen. Solo home runs happen. What I get frustrated with is the free passes than the home runs," Eickhoff said. "The multirun home runs, those are the ones that kill you. The solos, I could care less about."	Dyson hit the first pitch of the game to right field for his fourth homer of the season. Marte followed with his 16th home run on a drive to right. Peralta finished the long-ball barrage when he went deep to center for his ninth homer before most fans had settled into their soggy seats following a 30-minute rain delay.	"You can't really explain it," Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said. "I don't care what kind of ballpark you're in, whether it's a good hitting ballpark or not, when you hit 13 home runs in a game, you're doing a lot of things right."	It was the first time a team had hit three straight home runs to begin the first inning since the Diamondbacks did it on July 21, 2017, at home against Washington ace Max Scherzer.	Eickhoff gave up two-run shots in the fourth to Eduardo Escobar and Alex Avila. Eickhoff failed to retire a batter in the fourth when he was yanked by manager Gabe Kapler. Eickhoff has allowed 16 home runs this season in 57 1/3 innings, and he became the first pitcher in franchise history to surrender three straight homers to start the game.	Escobar hit his second of the game, a solo shot to left, in the fifth off reliever Ranger Suarez. Vargas also added a solo shot in the inning off Suarez for the record seventh home run of the game. Vargas put the exclamation point on the extended batting practice with a two-run homer in the ninth off Austin Davis.	The Diamondbacks had hit six homers in a game six times in franchise history, the last coming June 1, 2018, against the Marlins.	Jean Segura homered in the second inning off Diamondbacks starter Taylor Clarke (3 1/3 innings) and the Phillies tied at 3-all until the Diamondbacks blew the game open with a four-run fourth. Kingery had his first career multihomer game. Rhys Hoskins and Jay Bruce each hit solo shots in the ninth. Detroit and Chicago played each other twice (1995, 2002) when they combined for 12 homers.	"These are not the type of baseball games that we like to be in," Phillies manager Gabe Kapler said.	Arizona could do more than go deep. Escobar added an RBI double in the sixth to make it 11-4 and give him five RBIs and give the win to reliever Zack Godley (3-4) after 3 2/3 innings of scoreless ball.	"It's a good park for hitting," Escobar said. "You have good contact, you have a chance."	But 13?	Arizona connected a day after the Nationals hit four home runs in a row in the eighth inning at San Diego. The D-backs are the first team in baseball history to hit eight home runs in a game and surrender eight (March 28 vs. the Dodgers) in the same season.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: RF Adam Jones returned to the lineup after he missed the past four games with a right hamstring injury.	Phillies: OF Roman Quinn and RHP Edubray Ramos will started rehab assignments with Class A Clearwater. Quinn has been on the injured list since April 25 with a right groin strain. ... RHP Seranthony Dominguez will visit Dr. James Andrews this week for a second opinion on his injured right elbow. He could need Tommy John surgery. "Honestly, I'm hoping for a miracle," he said.	MINOR DEAL	The Phillies acquired international signing bonus slots from the Baltimore Orioles in exchange for RHP Tom Eshelman, the 2017 Paul Owens Award winner, given annually to the best pitcher in the Phillies minor league system.	RECORD DEAL	The Reds hold the NL record for homers in a game with nine in 1999, and Toronto hit 10 in a game in 1987 for the MLB mark.	UP NEXT	The Phillies send RHP Jake Arrieta (5-5, 4.29 ERA) to the mound against RHP Jon Duplantier (1-0, 3.27) on Tuesday in the second game of the three-game set.	The Associated Press contributed to this report.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

BOSTON --  Boston Red Sox manager Alex Cora started to feel it, with his ballclub loading the bases in the 10th inning after rallying to tie it in the ninth.	"This is kind of what David used to do," Cora said on a night when the game seemed secondary to his concern over former teammate David Ortiz. "It's one of those days you don't want to be a part of, honestly. But we have a job to do."	Danny Santana doubled to lead off the 11th for his fourth hit of the game and scored on Elvis Andrus' single, leading the Texas Rangers to a 4-3 victory over the Red Sox on Monday night.	Near the end of the game, Ortiz landed in his adopted city in an air ambulance from the Dominican Republic, where he was shot in the back while at a nightclub on Sunday night. Fans observed a moment of reflection before the game and chanted his nickname -- "Papi!" -- during it.	"You're talking about a guy that put a team and a city on his back, basically his entire career," said Red Sox starter Chris Sale, who struck out 10 in seven innings of three-hit ball and left with a 2-1 lead. "Obviously, you want to be able to pick him up when you can."	But the Red Sox weren't able to manage a walk-off hit like those that were the hallmark of Ortiz's career.	Instead, it was the Rangers who rallied from a 2-1 deficit in the ninth inning to take a 3-2 lead. Boston tied it in the bottom half to send the game into extra innings, but Texas went ahead again in the 11th -- and this time, it stuck.	Santana led off the 11th with a line drive down the line, a ball right fielder Mookie Betts had to dive for to stop it from bounding all the way to the corner for a potential inside-the-park homer. Andrus hit one up the middle past Ryan Brasier (2-3) to make it 4-3.	Jesse Chavez (2-1) pitched the 10th, and Chris Martin worked the 11th for his second save. The Rangers beat the Red Sox for just the third time in 15 games and snapped a six-game losing streak against Boston.	FOR STARTERS	Sale allowed just one unearned run.	Texas' Mike Minor allowed two runs on four hits and two walks, striking out six in eight innings. He walked Betts to lead off the bottom of the first, and Andrew Benintendi followed with a home run to left-center, his seventh of the season.	Minor only allowed four more baserunners.	"I'm proud of Mike," Texas manager Chris Woodward said. "He's trying to prove he's an elite pitcher. He gets down 2-0 to Sale, one of the best in the game, a lot of pitchers with any kind of doubt where they stand, if they're an elite pitcher or not, maybe kind of fold their tent."	FOR RELIEVERS	Brandon Workman pitched a perfect eighth for Boston, but Matt Barnes gave up a one-out single to Santana followed by a double by Andrus. With the infield in, Nomar Mazara fisted the ball over the head of shortstop Xander Bogaerts for a single to give Texas a 3-2 lead -- its first of the game.	It was Barnes' fourth blown save in eight opportunities.	"They took (Sale) out after seven and I think his pitch count was under 100, I think that kind of energized us," Minor said. "Bring in the 'pen, I know we're going to get these guys."	Texas reliever Shawn Kelley allowed two singles to start the ninth before Rafael Devers to hit a high chopper for a 4-3-6-3 double play. Brock Holt hit a blooper to left-center to score pinch-runner Michael Chavis and make it 3-3.	But Holt was easily thrown out at the plate when he tried to score from first on a high fly ball by Marco Hernandez that dropped in down the right field line for a double, sending the game into extra innings.	FALSE STARTS	The Red Sox loaded the bases in the 10th, but Bogaerts lofted an easy fly to center to end the inning.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: OF Willie Calhoun transferred to extended spring training in Arizona. He has been on the IL since May 22 with a left quad strain.	Red Sox: DH J.D. Martinez returned after missing four games with tightness in his back.	UP NEXT	The Rangers will send righty Ariel Jurado (3-2, 2.78 ERA) to the mound in the second game of the series against Darwinzon Hernandez (0-0), who will make his first career start. He pitched 2 1/3 scoreless innings of relief on April 23, his only major league appearance.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

MIAMI --  Michael Wacha was so excited to make his first start in nearly three weeks that he set the alarm in his hotel room for 4 o'clock.	That's 4 p.m.	The well-rested Wacha pitched six scoreless innings in his return to the St. Louis Cardinals' rotation Monday, and they broke a three-game losing streak by beating Miami 4-1.	Wacha (4-2), who was briefly demoted to the bullpen, benefited from three double plays and a pickoff in his first start since May 22. The former All-Star allowed five hits, struck out four and lowered his ERA to 5.63.	"He kind of re-established himself," manager Mike Shildt said. "He was tremendous. He's a legitimate rotation guy, and when right, he can be a top-of-the-line guy. He has proven that. He proved it tonight."	Wacha and his teammates arrived in Miami shortly before sunrise after losing at Wrigley Field on Sunday night, when the Cubs completed a series sweep.	"I probably didn't go to sleep until about 5," Wacha said. "I woke up at 2, had a little food and went back to sleep until 4. Not the normal schedule, but you've got to make it work sometimes."	Wacha said if he hadn't set an alarm, he would have slept some more.	There was no wakeup call for the Cardinals offense. They totaled only four hits but scored three unearned runs in the sixth, when catcher Jorge Alfaro made a wild throw on a sacrifice bunt.	"I'm mad at myself," Alfaro said. "I just threw it away."	Alfaro was also picked off second , and his error provided the cushion the Cardinals needed. John Gant followed Wacha and allowed one run in two innings. Jordan Hicks worked around a leadoff single in the ninth and struck out two for his 13th save.	The Marlins, saddled with the National League's worst record, have scored nine runs while losing five games in a row. Manager Don Mattingly was unhappy with his team's approach against Wacha.	"Really disappointing with the energy," Mattingly said. "We got away from our game plan. We wanted to get the ball up on this guy. We chased down, and we chased in."	Wacha walked two, threw only 75 pitches and earned another start Saturday at the New York Mets. He downplayed his desire to reclaim a spot in the rotation.	"I just pitch whenever they tell me to," he said.	Sandy Alcantara (3-6), facing his former team for the first time, struggled through five-plus innings and allowed four runs, but only one was earned.	"I was excited to face my old teammates," Alcantara said. "I tried to do my job, but today was not my day."	After the Cardinals' first two batters reached in the sixth, Kolten Wong laid down a bunt, and both runners scored when Alfaro threw the ball down the right field line. Wong, batting fifth, said he might have surprised the Marlins by not swinging away.	"Wins are hard to come by right now for us," Wong said. "I'm trying to do whatever I can to put guys in scoring position. Things haven't been going our way, so you do whatever you can."	Harrison Bader followed with a sacrifice fly.	The Cardinals scored the first run in the fourth on doubles by Marcell Ozuna and Yairo Munoz.	TAKE A BREAK	Cardinals SS Paul DeJong was given the night off. It was the first game he has missed.	FIRST-HAND LOOK	Derek Jeter watched JJ Bleday have a big night at the Southeastern Conference tournament, which may be one reason the Marlins took the Vanderbilt outfielder with the fourth pick in the draft last week.	"I only saw one game, and he was 5 for 5," said Jeter, the Marlins' CEO. "I told him everything is downhill from this point forward."	UP NEXT	Cardinals: RHP Dakota Hudson (4-3, 3.94) is scheduled to start Tuesday. He has an ERA of 2.19 over his past four outings, and the Cardinals have won each game.	Marlins: RHP Elieser Hernandez (0-0, 9.00) will be recalled from Triple-A New Orleans to make his first start of the season as a replacement for LHP Caleb Smith (left hip inflammation). It'll be the first time one of the Marlins' five starters to begin the season has missed a turn.	---	Follow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve-Wine	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

ATLANTA --  The Atlanta Braves stayed hot by hitting five home runs on a night a first-inning, stare-down contest created the biggest stir.	Ronald Acuna Jr. hit a grand slam, Ozzie Albies added two homers and the Braves beat Pittsburgh 13-7 on Monday night after Pirates starter Joe Musgrove was ejected in a first-inning fracas.	The Braves hit five homers, including two-run shots by Nick Markakis and Freddie Freeman. Markakis had four hits and drove in four runs.	Starling Marte hit two homers and drove in four runs for Pittsburgh.	Atlanta has won four straight, while the Pirates are on a four-game skid.	Musgrove hit Josh Donaldson with a first-inning pitch. As Donaldson began walking to first base, he exchanged glares with Musgrove, took a few steps toward the mound and then shoved catcher Elias Diaz, who intervened. The umpires huddled and announced ejections for Musgrove and Donaldson.	Pirates manager Clint Hurdle also was ejected by home plate umpire Brian Gorman after arguing the decision to toss Musgrove.	Musgrove's pitch only grazed Donaldson's jersey, but players from both dugouts and bullpens charged onto the field following the confrontation as Musgrove took off his cap and removed his glove. No punches were thrown and the field was quickly cleared.	Donaldson said he wasn't "really all that upset at all about getting hit by the pitch. It barely clipped me." He said he responded to an aggressive reaction by Musgrove.	"I feel like he came down the mound afterward," Donaldson said. "I looked away to try to give him a chance to look away from me. He kept coming down the mound and looking at me and obviously he had a problem with something."	Musgrove said he "did nothing more than stand my ground."	Musgrove said Donaldson "stared at me and tried to intimidate me and I'm not going to let that happen. I looked back at him and he had something to say and he crossed the line and came at me so I took my hat and glove off and got ready to fight and that got me tossed. I don't know what else I could do in that situation. ... I'm not going to run away and hide."	Hurdle placed the blame on Donaldson.	"The hard part is if the batter goes to first none of this happens," Hurdle said.	Braves right-hander Kevin Gausman struggled despite being given a 5-1 lead in the second inning. Gausman was pulled in the third when he gave up a three-run homer to Marte.	"The last couple of outings haven't been very good and it didn't look like it was going anywhere good today," said Braves manager Brian Snitker.	Marte hit another homer off Jerry Blevins in the eighth for his first multi-homer game since Aug. 18, 2014, also against Atlanta.	Left-hander Sean Newcomb (1-0) relieved Gausman and allowed only one hit with six strikeouts in 4 2/3 innings. Jacob Webb earned his second save. He entered the game with a 10-7 lead and recorded the final four outs.	Right-hander Alex McRae (0-2), who replaced Musgrove, allowed eight runs, six earned. He gave up three homers in 4 1/3 innings.	Gausman allowed four runs, two earned, on five hits in 2 1/3 innings. His ERA climbed to 6.21.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: RHP Jordan Lyles was placed on the 10-day injured list with tightness in his left hamstring. Lyles lasted only three innings in Saturday's loss at Milwaukee. Hurdle said Lyles' hamstring issue caused "collateral damage" to the bullpen. ... RHP Montana DuRapau was recalled from Triple-A Indianapolis and gave up three runs in the eighth.	Braves: There is no timetable on the return of OF Ender Inciarte (back). Inciarte was placed on the 10-day IL on May 15 and continues to have discomfort. ... LHP Dallas Keuchel, the 2015 AL Cy Young Award winner who signed a one-year deal with Atlanta last week, allowed only one hit and had nine strikeouts in seven scoreless innings for Class A Rome. He may make his Atlanta debut after one more minor league start.	MILESTONE FOR MARKAKIS	Markakis earned an ovation in the sixth inning after his run-scoring single gave him 1,000 career RBI. Markakis, who rarely shows emotion, tipped his helmet to the fans and briefly smiled. The Braves had a clubhouse toast for Markakis following the game.	"Like I said, it just means I'm getting old," the 35-year-old Markakis said, before adding, "It was a good night."	STREAKS END	Pirates rookie Bryan Reynolds went 0-for-5, ending his 17-game hitting streak and 24-game streak of reaching base safely.	FIRST SLAM	The 436-foot shot to left field was Acuna's first career regular-season slam . He hit a slam in last season's NL division series loss to the Dodgers.	UP NEXT	Pirates: RHP Chris Archer (3-5, 5.20 ERA) will make his second straight start against the Braves after allowing one run in six innings in a 6-1 home win on Thursday.	Braves: RHP Mike Foltynewicz (1-5, 5.89) is 1-4 with a 6.26 ERA in five career starts against the Pirates. He allowed three runs in six innings in Thursday's loss at Pittsburgh.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

Turner homered in the second straight game, Anibal Sanchez pitched into the seventh and the Washington Nationals beat the Chicago White Sox 12-1 on Monday night.	But there were more questions about fan safety when woman was struck by a foul ball off the bat of White Sox outfielder Eloy Jimenez. He hit a hard liner into the stands in the fourth inning just beyond Chicago's dugout on the third base side. The woman was sitting several rows from the field. She was bleeding around the head area, and was covered with a towel.	She walked up toward the concourse with assistance of stadium personnel. The team said she was alert and taken to a hospital for evaluation.	Jimenez put his hands on his helmet after seeing the ball go into the stands. Protective netting at Guaranteed Rate Field extends to the end of the dugouts.	Jimenez was not available for comment after the game.	Major League Baseball said late last month it will keep examining its policy on protective netting at stadiums a day after a foul ball by the Chicago Cubs' Albert Almora hit a young fan during a game at Houston.	TURNER COMES THROUGH	Turner tripled and scored in the third, went deep against Odrisamer Despaigne leading off the fifth and added an RBI double in the seventh. He also struck out leading off the game and in the eighth and popped out in the ninth.	"I felt like I got a couple of pitches to hit in those last two at-bats, but it didn't happen. That's baseball," Turner said. "I think it's one of those things where the more you try, the less likely it's gonna happen."	Sanchez (2-6) gave up one run and four hits. He left after James McCann singled leading off the seventh.	Adam Eaton had three hits, including an RBI single, in his first game at Guaranteed Rate Field since Chicago traded him to Washington at the 2016 winter meetings. Kurt Suzuki added a grand slam during a six-run ninth and had five RBI to help the Nationals win for the 12th time in 16 games.	Leury Garcia hit a solo homer for Chicago in the sixth inning. Yoan Moncada left the game in the seventh with upper back tightness.	Despaigne (0-1) went six innings in his first major league appearance since a relief outing for the Los Angeles Angels against Oakland last Sept. 30. The 32-year-old right-hander allowed three runs and seven hits after the White Sox purchased his contract from Triple-A Charlotte. But the White Sox fell short after winning eight of 12.	"I'm not satisfied with what I did against the first batter of each inning," Despaigne said. "I'm really confident my next outing will be better than this one."	JUMPING AHEAD	Washington got a run in the second on Suzuki's sacrifice fly and another in the third when Eaton followed Turner's leadoff triple with a bloop single.	Part of the procession in Sunday's win at San Diego when Washington hit four consecutive homers, Turner made it 3-0 when he drove a 2-1 fastball out to left leading off the fifth.	"When we've got Trea getting on base and leading off, it creates a lot of havoc," Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. "It gets us going."	DELMONICO RELEASED	The White Sox released injured outfielder Nicky Delmonico on Monday.	The 26-year-old Delmonico was optioned to Triple-A Charlotte about three weeks ago and had season-ending surgery for a torn labrum in his left shoulder on May 30. He batted .227 with 18 home runs and 54 RBI over parts of three seasons with Chicago.	The White Sox also placed left-hander Jace Fry (sore left shoulder) on the 10-day injured list.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: RHP Justin Miller (right rotator cuff strain) pitched a scoreless inning Saturday for Double-A Harrisburg in a rehab appearance. Martinez said Miller will get "a few more games" before potentially moving up. . 1B Matt Adams suffered a left oblique strain on a checked swing in the sixth and will likely miss at least a game or two, Martinez said.	White Sox: Moncada was replaced at third base by Jose Rondon at the start of the seventh inning and is listed as day to day.	UP NEXT	Nationals: LHP Patrick Corbin (5-4, 3.59 ERA) tries to bounce back after getting pounded in back-to-back losses to Cincinnati and San Diego. He allowed a combined 13 runs -- nine earned -- in 7 2/3 innings.	White Sox: LHP Manny Banuelos (3-4, 7.36 ERA) makes his first start since beating Cleveland on May 30. He lost his previous four outings.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

DENVER --  Ian Desmond hit a monster blast that brought fans to their feet but it was a manufactured run that made the difference for the Colorado Rockies.	Colorado scored its first five runs on homers -- including Desmond's 486-foot rocket -- but Ryan McMahon delivered the go-ahead run with a single in the eighth inning, and Colorado rallied to beat the Chicago Cubs 6-5 on Monday night.	Nolan Arenado and Charlie Blackmon also went deep for the Rockies, who have won nine straight at home, but Desmond's shot onto the concourse got everyone's attention.	"Some of us were in awe. He walloped that one pretty good," Daniel Murphy said. "It was a good swing, good at-bat, and a big swing for us, too."	Anthony Rizzo, Kyle Schwarber and David Bote homered for the Cubs. Bote, who grew up in Longmont, Colo., outside of Denver and made his major league debut at Coors Field in 2018, hit his first homer in Colorado.	"Coming back this summer was a little bit more enjoyable than last year," he said. "My debut wasn't successful."	The game was tied 5-all when Murphy doubled and stole third with one out in the eighth. McMahon drove him in with a single to right-center off of Steve Cishek (1-3).	"(Murphy) was causing havoc out there so maybe Cishek was thinking about him a little bit at third, probably afraid to bounce something, trying to be a little more perfect with his pitches," McMahon said. "Got me something to hit".	Wade Davis got the final three outs for his eighth save and first since coming off the 10-day injured list on Friday.	The teams used the long ball to put up four runs each in the third inning. Bote and Schwarber went back-to-back on consecutive pitches to score the first two, and Rizzo hit a two-run homer to center to give Chicago a 4-0 lead. Rizzo finished with three hits.	Blackmon and Arenado each had a two-run homer off Yu Darvish in the bottom of the inning to tie it. Desmond gave the Rockies a 5-4 lead with his mammoth pinch-hit homer in the seventh that hit a restaurant on one bounce on the concourse. It is the longest home run in the majors this year, according to Statcast.	"As long as it goes over the fence I don't care how far it goes," Desmond said.	The Cubs tied it in the eighth on Javier Baez's groundout off Scott Oberg (4-0) before the Rockies answered in the bottom of the inning.	"It was there for us, we just could not finish it up," Chicago manager Joe Maddon said.	Darvish and Rockies starter German Marquez each allowed four runs in six innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: 3B Kris Bryant rolled his ankle against St. Louis on Sunday but was in the lineup.	Rockies: Colorado placed RHP Seunghwan Oh on the 10-day injured with a left abdominal strain, retroactive to Friday, and purchased the contract of LHP Phillip Diehl from Triple-A Albuquerque.	CARGO RETURNS	Chicago outfielder Carlos Gonzalez made his first appearance at Coors Field in a different uniform. Gonzalez played 10 seasons with the Rockies, becoming a free agent after last season. He signed with the Cubs on June 1 after hitting .210 in 30 games with Cleveland.	His return to Colorado was bittersweet for the three-time All-Star and 2010 NL batting champ.	"Obviously, this is home for me," he said before the game. "I got a lot of memories of this place. It is what it is. I'm now on the other side."	Colorado honored him with a video before the game and the fans gave him a 30-second standing ovation when he came to the plate in the second inning. Rockies players joined in the ovation.	"Real recognizes real. He's a heck of a player," Desmond said.	Gonzalez, who was 0 for 3 with a walk Monday, made his Cubs debut against the Rockies in Chicago last week, two days after signing with the club.	"I was home waiting for a job and the next thing I know I'm playing couple of games in Triple-A and hours later playing against my ex-teammates," he said. "It was great seeing them competing against each other."	UP NEXT	Colorado rookie right-hander Peter Lambert (1-0, 1.29 ERA) makes his Coors Field debut on Tuesday night, five days after winning his first major league start when he beat the Cubs. Chicago left-hander Jose Quintana (4-5, 3.77) took the loss in that game and is on the mound for his fourth career start at Colorado.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Although the biggest crowd in 21 years at Angel Stadium had plenty of blue in it, the red-clad home fans left the Freeway Series opener more exhilarated and probably more exhausted.	The Los Angeles Angels' tiebreaking, two-run, no-hit rally in the eighth inning was a bizarre baseball marvel -- and it was all made possible by an earlier moment of brilliance from Mike Trout in a dramatic comeback victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers.	Trout hit a tying two-run homer in the seventh, and Shohei Ohtani slid home from third with the go-ahead run in the eighth inning of the Angels' 5-3 win Monday night.	Hyun-Jin Ryu pitched the Dodgers to a 3-1 lead through six innings and put himself in position for his seventh consecutive victory, but the Angels emphatically rallied against the Dodgers' bullpen at a sold-out Big A.	By the time the Angels turned a 3-6-1 double play to end it, a typical week's worth of excitement had been crammed into three innings in Anaheim, where there hasn't been much to cheer.	"The atmosphere was unbelievable," Trout said. "It's the best the crowd has been all year. The atmosphere is great every time we play the Dodgers, here or in LA. The competition is great to be a part of."	The Halos' success was tied to another disappointing night for the Dodgers' bullpen, perhaps the only area of significant concern for the powerhouse two-time defending NL champions.	After Trout tied it with a two-out, two-strike homer off Dylan Floro, the Angels scored two runs without a hit off beleaguered Dodgers reliever Joe Kelly (1-3) in the eighth.	Ohtani drew a leadoff walk as a pinch-hitter, advancing to second on Kelly's throwing error and getting to third on a wild pitch. Wilfredo Tovar hit a short grounder to third with the bases loaded, but Ohtani sped home as Max Muncy's high throw pulled Russell Martin's foot off the plate.	Brian Goodwin then scored on the second wild pitch of the inning by Kelly, whose rough debut season in the Dodgers' bullpen got even worse. Kelly, who got a three-year, $27 million deal in the offseason to return to his native Southern California after winning a ring in Boston, hadn't pitched in a high-leverage situation in a few weeks after his rocky start to his Dodgers tenure.	"We're going to need him," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said of Kelly. "That's just plain and simple. So we've got to figure out a way to -- mechanical, emotional, mental -- just tap into something and get him on track."	Chris Taylor had an early two-run double for the Dodgers, who went scoreless in the final seven innings and lost for only the fourth time in 17 games.	Ty Buttrey (4-2) escaped a two-on, nobody out jam of his own making in the eighth for the Angels, who had lost five of seven heading into their interleague rivalry series. The major league-leading Dodgers had won 13 of 16.	Hansel Robles gave up two leadoff singles in the ninth, but covered first to finish that double play and his eighth save.	Trout went 0 for 3 with two inning-ending strikeouts against Ryu, but the superstar evened the game with his 18th homer off Floro.	CANNING'S CLASS	Angels rookie Griffin Canning yielded just five hits over six innings in his first taste of this rivalry, retiring 10 of 11 at one point and pitching out of a jam in the sixth.	"They're a really good-hitting team," Canning said. "I just stayed aggressive and didn't back off."	Canning still left trailing 3-1 after the Dodgers' three-run rally in the second. After Taylor drove in Corey Seager and Martin in the second, Enrique Hernandez followed with another double to score Taylor.	Calhoun hit his 14th homer later in the second, but Ryu stranded six runners over the next five innings.	RELENTLESS RYU	Ryu yielded seven hits and one run over six resilient innings, but the Dodgers' dominant lefty was denied 10th victory of the season when his bullpen couldn't hold the lead. Ryu hadn't failed to win a start since May 1, and he still hasn't allowed more than two runs in a start this season.	Ryu gave up his first homer since April 26 when Kole Calhoun connected in the second inning, ending his streak of 19 2/3 scoreless innings. Ryu hadn't even allowed a run in five of his six previous starts.	"It just comes down to command and executing pitches and staying with the game plan," Ryu said through a translator.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: David Freese didn't play because of nagging right knee tendinitis. Hernandez played first base instead, with Muncy playing third.	Angels: Matt Harvey had a setback in his return from a back injury, and his rehab assignment at Triple-A Salt Lake will be interrupted. He hasn't pitched for Los Angeles since May 23.	UP NEXT	Kenta Maeda (7-2, 3.61 ERA) is likely to face Ohtani in the second game of the Freeway Series. The Angels counter with opener Cam Bedrosian followed by Felix Pena (4-1, 4.53 ERA), who has never beaten the Dodgers or won an interleague game.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

NEW YORK --  A year ago this week, Luke Voit was demoted to Double-A by the St. Louis Cardinals. Now he's vying for an All-Star selection and a spot in the Home Run Derby.	"It's crazy, man," he said after his tiebreaking three-run homer off Zack Wheeler in a five-run fourth inning led the New York Yankees over the Mets 12-5 Tuesday in the opener of a day-night Subway Series doubleheader.	Voit has 30 home runs in 102 games since the Yankees acquired him from St. Louis last July 28 for pitchers Chasen Shreve and Giovanny Gallegos. The 28-year-old took over at first base from the repeatedly injured Greg Bird and has 16 homers this year. He is the leader at his position in the first results of fan voting for All-Star starters.	"This team is giving me a lot of confidence to go out and do my job every day," he said. "It's just having fun in the locker room. I never feel like I'm a deadbeat."	He made his big league debut with St. Louis in 2017 but was stuck behind Matt Carpenter and then Jose Martinez. Voit spent parts of five seasons in the Cardinals minor league season but had just five home runs in 70 games in the big leagues at the time of the trade.	"There's nothing worse than when you're in the minor leagues and you're hitting good, too, and you're just stuck," he said. "There's been multiple guys throughout the history of baseball that have been in that same situation, and for me to finally get a chance, you don't want to ever look back on it and you want to roll with it."	Gio Urshela hit a tying, two-run homer in the fourth, had four RBI and was a triple short of the cycle, ending a stretch of 15 at-bats without a hit.	Gary Sanchez had three RBI and tied for the AL lead with his 20th home run, a two-run drive against Tim Peterson in the eighth.	Masahiro Tanaka (4-5) gave up a three-run homer to Jeff McNeil that put the Mets ahead 4-1 in the third but rebounded to win for the first time in a month.	James Paxton (3-2) was set to start the second game for the Yankees and Jason Vargas (2-3) for the Mets in a matchup of left-handers.	Less than one-quarter of the seats were filled for the start of the makeup of Monday night's rainout. Despite brilliant sunshine on the late spring afternoon, the usual crowd buzz for the matchup of New York rivals was absent.	"There was a lot of Mets fans here," Voit said. "You could hear the guys in the stands giving us trouble. It was entertaining."	Third baseman Todd Frazier made a throwing error on a two-out grounder in the fourth. After a walk, Voit's homer on a slider put the Yankees ahead. The Yankees made three errors and the Mets two.	"It's on me. The end of that inning is on me," Frazier said.	Pitching on six days' rest after the birth of his daughter Friday and the rainout, Tanaka allowed five runs -- four earned -- and seven hits in 6 2/3 innings. He had been 0-2 in four starts since winning May 12 at Tampa Bay.	The Mets have lost 18 of their last 22 road games, At 32-34, they have not been over .500 since May 3.	Wheeler (5-4) gave up a career-high nine runs -- five earned -- and 10 hits in 4 2/3 innings. Coming off a five-hit shutout of San Francisco, he has not won consecutive starts this year, and his 13 home runs allowed are one shy of his 2018 total.	"My slider wasn't very good today. The changeup wasn't really working," Wheeler said. "The fastball was about the only thing going for me."	DOUBLE TROUBLE	This was the fifth doubleheader between the teams. The Yankees swept the first three before a split in 2008.	WEB GEM	Yankees left fielder Brett Gardner made a sprawling backhand catch on McNeil leading off the game.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: 2B Robinson Cano (left quadriceps), OF Brandon Nimmo (neck) and LHP Justin Wilson (left elbow) were to play for Triple-A Syracuse against Charlotte. ... RHP Noah Syndergaard left before the opener because of strep throat.	Yankees: RHP Dellin Betances strained his lat muscle while pitching to batters in a simulated game on Friday and won't throw for a few weeks, manager Aaron Boone said. Betances has not pitched in a game since March 17 because of a right shoulder impingement. ... OF-DH Giancarlo Stanton went 2 for 4 with a solo home run as the DH for Class A Tampa in a doubleheader opener. Sidelined by biceps, shoulder and calf injuries, Stanton has not played for the Yankees since March 31 and reinjured himself May 20 on the first day of his previous rehab assignment. ... RHP Jonathan Loaisiga (right shoulder) threw on flat ground for the first time since May 9.	UP NEXT	Mets: RHP Jacob deGrom (3-6) starts Thursday when the Mets open a homestand against St. Louis and RHP Jack Flaherty (4-3).	Yankees: LHP J.A. Happ (6-3) is likely to start Thursday's series opener at the Chicago White Sox.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

CLEVELAND --  Oscar Mercado admitted it wasn't easy to stay calm when he came to the plate in the 10th inning.	The Indians rookie outfielder did, and the result was another clutch hit.	Mercado's bases-loaded single with one out in the 10th gave Cleveland a 2-1 win over the Cincinnati Reds in the intrastate matchup Tuesday night.	"That was pretty incredible," Mercado said. "I'm not going to lie. Just breathing is the biggest thing at that time in those at-bats, but it's hard. The game's on the line."	Mercado lined a 1-2 pitch from Raisel Iglesias (1-6) to left field and was mobbed by his teammates after rounding first base.	Mercado was doused with water buckets as he did a postgame interview in front of the dugout.	Mike Freeman drew a one-out walk and took third on a single by Leonys Martin. Francisco Lindor was intentionally walked, setting the stage for Mercado, who glanced toward Cleveland's star shortstop before he stepped in.	"The first thing I did was look at him," Mercado said. "He's one of the most selfless guys I've been around. He was sort of walking me through some things to do, like stay calm."	Mercado, who was called up from Triple-A Columbus on May 14, hit a tie-breaking home run off CC Sabathia in a win over the New York Yankees on Saturday.	Brad Hand (3-2) pitched two scoreless innings and struck out the side in the 10th.	Reds manager David Bell still has confidence in Iglesias, despite his high loss total.	"He's going to be out there in key spots, so things like that are going to happen," Bell said. "It didn't work out tonight, but he's going to continue to get big opportunities in games."	Cleveland has won five of seven on its homestand, taking two of three from Minnesota and the Yankees.	Indians starter Trevor Bauer allowed one run in 7 2/3 innings and threw 118 pitches. Reds starter Luis Castillo allowed a solo homer to Carlos Santana in the fourth and struck out six in six innings.	Bauer walked Derek Dietrich with two outs in the eighth and was replaced by Oliver Perez. Pinch-hitter Kyle Farmer singled to deep short and Nick Wittgren retired Yasiel Puig on a fly ball to right.	Bauer worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the seventh that started with a double by Puig. Bauer issued one-out walks to Jose Iglesias and Tucker Barnhart -- the No. 8 and No. 9 hitters.	Bauer fielded Nick Senzel's tapper in front of the mound and threw home to start an inning-ending double play. Catcher Roberto Perez stepped on the plate and threw to first, retiring Senzel.	Bauer pumped his right fist and jumped over the third-base foul line on his way to the dugout.	Senzel had an RBI double in the fifth.	Cleveland loaded the bases with one out in the sixth, but Castillo struck out Jose Ramirez and Jake Bauers.	"Luis was tired, but he got the job done in the sixth," Bell said. "He was very impressive. So was Bauer. Bauer pitched a great game, as well."	Santana hit a one-out homer in the fourth, his team-leading 15th.	David Hernandez entered the game in the eighth for the Reds and struck out five of the six batters he faced.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: 2B Scooter Gennett (strained right groin) is taking batting practice through Saturday at Cincinnati's training facility in Goodyear, Arizona. He was injured on March 22.	Indians: 2B Jason Kipnis (sore hip) was out of the lineup. ... RHP Mike Clevinger (strained back muscle) pitched 5 1/3 scoreless innings Wednesday on a rehab assignment at Double-A Akron. ... RHP Corey Kluber will undergo further scans on his broken arm Thursday. He was hit by a line drive May 1	HOMETOWN HERO	Dietrich, who grew up in the Cleveland suburb of Parma, would love to take part in the Home Run Derby as part of the All-Star Game festivities next month.	"I'm a Cleveland kid and I've played a long time in the major leagues," he said. "I'm hoping to get an opportunity to represent the Cincinnati Reds in my hometown. It would be a dream come true."	Dietrich has 17 homers this season. He won a high school home run contest at the ballpark in 2006.	UP NEXT	Reds: RHP Anthony DeSclafani (2-3, 4.70 ERA) makes his third career start at Progressive Field, where he is 1-0 with a 1.29 ERA over 14 career innings.	Indians: RHP Zach Plesac (1-1, 1.86 ERA) earned his first major league victory in his last start, holding the Yankees to two runs in seven innings on June 7.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

NEW YORK --  When it comes to All-Star first basemen, Pete Alonso and Luke Voit are on track to become New York's power couple.	Alonso hit a three-run homer in the first inning off an ineffective James Paxton, J.D. Davis and Carlos Gomez also went deep, and the Mets beat the Yankees 10-4 Tuesday for a split of their day-night Subway Series doubleheader.	Alonso's home run was his 22nd, the second-most for an NL rookie before the All-Star break, trailing only Cody Bellinger's 25 for the Los Angeles Dodgers two years ago. The drive on Paxton's eighth pitch of the at-bat and 11th pitch of the night left the stadium almost as quiet as it was in the afternoon, when the stands were about a quarter full at the start for the makeup of Monday night's rainout.	Voit hit a three-run homer off Zack Wheeler in a five-run fourth inning as the Yankees overcame a three-run deficit to win the opener 12-5. After falling out of the AL East lead for the first time since the morning of May 19, the Yankees (41-25) moved back into a tie with Tampa Bay atop the division.	Both first basemen experienced their first Subway Series featuring fulminating fans.	"I thought this was a blast," the 24-year-old Alonso said. "I'm really looking forward to the ones at Citi Field. This environment was nuts."	Voit was demoted to Double-A by the St. Louis Cardinals a year ago this week. Now he's vying for a spot in the All-Star Home Run Derby.	"It's crazy, man," he said.	Voit has 30 home runs in 103 games since the Yankees acquired him July 28 for pitchers Chasen Shreve and Giovanny Gallegos. The 28-year-old took over at first base from the repeatedly injured Greg Bird and has 16 homers this year. He is the leader at his position in the first results of fan voting for All-Star starters.	"This team is giving me a lot of confidence to go out and do my job every day," he said. "It's just having fun in the locker room. I never feel like I'm a deadbeat."	He made his big league debut with St. Louis in 2017 but was behind Matt Carpenter and then Jose Martinez.	"There's nothing worse than when you're in the minor leagues and you're hitting good, too, and you're just stuck," he said. "There's been multiple guys throughout the history of baseball that have been in that same situation, and for me to finally get a chance, you don't want to ever look back on it and you want to roll with it."	Gio Urshela hit a tying, two-run homer in the five-run fourth, had four RBI and was a triple short of the cycle, ending a stretch of 15 at-bats without a hit. Gary Sanchez had three RBI and tied for the AL lead with his 20th home run .	Masahiro Tanaka (4-5) gave up a three-run homer to Jeff McNeil that put the Mets ahead 4-1 in the third but rebounded to win for the first time in a month. Pitching on six days' rest after the birth of his daughter Friday and the rainout, Tanaka allowed five runs -- four earned -- in 6 2/3 innings.	Wheeler (5-4) gave up a career-high nine runs -- five earned -- in 4 2/3 innings. He has not won consecutive starts this year, and his 13 home runs allowed are one shy of his 2018 total.	"My slider wasn't very good today. The changeup wasn't really working," Wheeler said. "The fastball was about the only thing going for me."	Coming off a five-hit shutout of San Francisco, Jason Vargas (3-3) extended his scoreless streak to 17 innings in the night game before the Yankees closed to 6-3 in the third. Davis hit a two-run homer off Chance Adams in the fourth, and the Yankees put two on with one out in the bottom half when Vargas found a groove and retired his last eight batters.	"I think that third inning got them fairly aggressive, and we were able to get back in the rhythm of things, making pitches down in the strike zone," Vargas said.	The Mets (33-34), who have not been over .500 since May 3, won for only the fifth time in their last 23 road games.	Paxton (3-3) remained winless in three starts since a trip to the injured list caused by left knee inflammation. He gave up a season-high six runs, seven hits and two walks in 2 2/3 innings, departing after RBI singles from Michael Conforto, Wilson Ramos and Adeiny Hechavarria.	"I've dealt with failure before, and I'll bounce back like I have before," Paxton said.	WEB GEM	Yankees left fielder Brett Gardner made a sprawling backhand catch on McNeil leading off the opener.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: 2B Robinson Cano (left quadriceps) was 3 for 3 with two doubles and an RBI in a rehab appearance for Triple-A Syracuse, OF Brandon Nimmo (neck) was 0 for 3 with two walks, and LHP Justin Wilson (left elbow) allowed one hit in a scoreless first. ... RHP Noah Syndergaard left before the opener because of strep throat.	Yankees: OF-DH Giancarlo Stanton went 2 for 4 with a solo home run as the DH for Class A Tampa in a doubleheader opener and could rejoin the Yankees on Monday. ... RF Aaron Judge could start a rehab assignment this weekend with Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.  ... RHP Dellin Betances strained his lat muscle while pitching to batters in a simulated game Friday and won't throw for a few weeks. ... RHP Jonathan Loaisiga (right shoulder strain) threw on flat ground for the first time since May 9.	UP NEXT	Mets: RHP Jacob deGrom (3-6) starts Thursday when the Mets start a homestand against St. Louis and RHP Jack Flaherty (4-3).	Yankees: LHP J.A. Happ (6-3) opens a series Thursday against the Chicago White Sox and RHP Ivan Nova (3-5).	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

PHILADELPHIA --  Scott Kingery's utility role has turned into a starting job, thanks to his hitting.	Kingery hit a three-run homer, Jake Arrieta threw six effective innings and the Philadelphia Phillies snapped Arizona's five-game winning streak with a 7-4 victory over the Diamondbacks on Tuesday night.	Kingery gave the Phillies a 3-0 lead in the second inning with a drive to left, his seventh homer and third in two games. He had eight homers as a rookie last year when he started at five positions and played everything but catcher and first base. He's settled into playing center field or third base every day recently.	"Last year, it was a lot of crazy stuff going on, playing a lot of different positions and learning to hit major league pitching. I didn't have time to relax," Kingery said. "I have more confidence now. My mindset and approach have changed."	Arrieta (6-5) allowed three runs and six hits for his second win in eight starts. Hector Neris pitched the ninth for his 14th save in 14 tries.	"It's a challenge but when my sinker is down in the strike zone efficiently, the ball stays in the ballpark," Arrieta said about facing a team that hit eight homers Monday.	Ketel Marte went deep for the Diamondbacks, and the teams combined for only two homers a night after setting a major league record with 13.	Arizona lefty Jon Duplantier (1-1) gave up four runs and seven hits in three innings.	After Kingery's homer, Bryce Harper ripped an RBI double to right to make it 4-0.	Jay Bruce made an excellent sliding catch to prevent at least one run on Marte's sinking liner to left with one out and runners on first and second in the third.	"He was emphatic that he can play the outfield and play it well," Phillies manager Gabe Kapler said of Bruce, who arrived in a trade on June 2. "He's done it well."	Carson Kelly's two-run double with two outs in the fourth cut it to 4-2. Eduardo Escobar's sacrifice fly in the fifth got Arizona within a run.	The Phillies regained their two-run lead in the bottom half. Bruce had an RBI single after J.T. Realmuto hit a double on which Rhys Hoskins scored following a throwing error by left fielder David Peralta.	"Those are things we're usually very good at. We throw the ball to the right base. We don't compound things," Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said. "We'll clean that up and when we do we'll win those margins."	Marte connected off J.D. Hammer in the seventh.	HECTOR'S RUN	Neris has converted 16 straight saves and he's 45 of 48 since June 21, 2017. Only Toronto's Ken Giles, a former Phillies closer, has a better percentage (94.7%) in that span. Giles is 54 for 57.	BULLPEN BOUND	The Phillies are removing Jerad Eickhoff from the starting rotation after he posted an 8.89 ERA in his last six starts and allowed 16 homers in 27 1/3 innings. The team hasn't decided on a starter for Sunday in his spot.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: RF Adam Jones wasn't in the lineup for the fifth time in six games but entered in the seventh. He missed four straight with a right hamstring injury before returning Monday.	Phillies: OF Roman Quinn was 2 for 4 with a stolen base in his second rehab game at Class A Clearwater. Quinn has been on the injured list since April 25 with a right groin strain. RHPs Edubray Ramos and Pat Neshek and LHP Adam Morgan are close to returning from the injured list.	UP NEXT	The Phillies send RHP Zach Eflin (6-5, 2.88 ERA) to the mound and RHP Merrill Kelly (6-6, 4.12) goes for the Diamondbacks on Wednesday in the series finale.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

BALTIMORE --  Baltimore Orioles rookie John Means admittedly had to grind through his latest start.	Nonetheless, he was still able to put his team in position for a much-needed win.	Means tied a season-high with seven strikeouts and the Orioles took the series opener from the Toronto Blue Jays 4-2 on Tuesday night.	"I have to attack better," Means said. "I wasn't getting ahead of guys either, so that was an issue. Not only were there long at-bats, but I wasn't getting strike one, strike two, very consistently. I had to pitch behind in the count a lot. That's definitely on me."	Means (6-4) allowed one run on four hits with three walks over five innings and lowered his ERA to 2.60.	Baltimore reliever Shawn Armstrong threw a pair of scoreless innings with three strikeouts. Miguel Castro entered and allowed a bloop RBI double to Randal Grichuk that pulled the Blue Jays to within 3-2 in the eighth.	The Orioles answered in the bottom half with a double that scored Stevie Wilkerson for a key insurance run. Mychal Givens pitched the ninth and picked up his sixth save.	Anthony Santander had three hits and an RBI-double for Baltimore, which can win consecutive games for the first time since May 4-6 and a series for the first time since April 22-24.	"I'm not concerned about the standings," Baltimore manager Brandon Hyde said. "I'm concerned about how we play and I'm concerned about trying to win a game that night and how we prepare that day, and if we're playing the game the right way, giving these guys opportunities to develop at the major league level. Obviously, winning is what this is about. At the same time, we're process-based right now and we're going to try to give guys opportunities to have success."	Eric Sogard led off the game with his sixth home run for the Blue Jays, who dropped their fifth straight game and have lost 11 of 13.	Blue Jays rookie right-hander Trent Thornton (1-5) loaded the bases on three walks in the second, but the Orioles couldn't capitalize. Baltimore took a 2-1 lead the following inning on back-to-back doubles by Trey Mancini and Chance Sisco.	The Orioles extended the lead to 3-1 in the fourth when a pop up by Santander landed between the second baseman Sogard and right fielder Grichuk.	Thornton allowed three runs and seven hits with four strikeouts and three walks over five innings.	Toronto has scored two or fewer runs in five consecutive games for the first time since 2014.	"We're working hard, the hitting coaches are working hard." Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said.	"There are still (more than) three months left. There are lots of chances for us to get hot. I really believe that we will."	DRAFT UPDATE	The Orioles have signed 20 of the 41 players taken in this year's MLB draft, the highest being fourth-round pick Joey Ortiz, a shortstop from New Mexico State. General manager Mike Elias still expects "everything to go smoothly" with signing catcher Adley Rutschman, the No. 1 overall pick from Oregon State.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: RHP David Phelps, who underwent Tommy John surgery in March 2018, still needs "a few more minor-league appearances" before the team decides the next course of action, Montoyo said.	Orioles: RHP Alex Cobb will undergo season-ending hip surgery. He went 0-2 with a 10.95 ERA in just three starts this season. "He clearly hasn't been 100 percent and it's more important to us that we get this issue corrected at the right time and have him 100 percent for next spring training," Elias said.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays: Edwin Jackson (0-4, 11.90 ERA) has struggled to get on track and allowed six runs (two earned) and six hits over 3 1/3 innings in his last start against the Yankees. Jackson is 6-1 with a 3.06 ERA in 11 career games (nine starts) against Baltimore.	Orioles: David Hess (1-8, 7.08 ERA) is looking to recapture the form of his first start April 1 against Toronto when he carried a no-hitter into the seventh inning. He has since gone winless with an 8.20 ERA over his next 11 appearances.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Mike Fiers has found his groove and it's been important for the inconsistent Oakland Athletics.	Fiers pitched six effective innings, Matt Olson and Khris Davis hit consecutive homers, and the Athletics beat the Tampa Bay Rays 4-3 on Tuesday night.	Oakland, at 34-34, is three games behind Texas for the second AL wild card.	"Obviously the record right now doesn't show how good we really are," Fiers said. "It's a long season. You can't look too far ahead or how far ahead some of the teams are ahead of us. We've got to come play every day and just battle every day."	Fiers (6-3) allowed two runs and three hits, and is 4-0 in seven starts beginning with his no-hitter against Cincinnati on May 7.	Liam Hendriks, Lou Trivino and Blake Treinen, who gave up Willy Adames' RBI single in the ninth en route to his 15th save, combined to strike out six and complete the four-hitter.	"We really haven't hit our stride yet," Oakland manager Bob Melvin said. "It's been a little of a fight and battle for us to this point but I think at some point we'll get past it."	Tommy Pham homered for the Rays, who are 16 games over .500 despite an 18-15 record at home.	"Kind of quiet at the plate," Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash said. "We didn't do many things wrong, we were just pitched really, really tough."	The Rays are tied for first in the AL East with the New York Yankees, who split a day-night doubleheader with the Mets.	After Matt Chapman reached on shortstop Adames' throwing error in the sixth, Olson hit a two-run homer and Davis then went deep two pitches later off Emilio Pagan (1-1) as Oakland took a 4-2 lead.	Pagan, acquired by Tampa Bay from the Athletics in a three-team trade in December, had allowed just one run over 19 innings in his previous 18 appearances.	"No one likes doing bad," Pagan said. "Doesn't make me any more upset than it would anybody else."	Pham put the Rays up 1-0 on a first-inning homer. He had been 1 for 17 in five games since returning June 6 from lower right leg injury.	Adames walked with two outs in the fourth, went to third on Kevin Kiermaier's single and scored to make it 2-0 on a double steal.	Oakland got to 2-1 on Chad Pinder's RBI single in the fifth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: SS Marcus Semien played in his 150th consecutive game, dating to last June 28. "He's as durable a player as I've ever had, so at this point in time I don't see a day off for him," Melvin said. Semien extended his hitting streak to nine games (16 for 39) after leading off the game with a double.	Rays: DH Austin Meadows finished his at-bat in the eighth after fouling a ball off his lower right leg. Soreness in the leg will likely keep him out of Wednesday's lineup. ... INF Joey Wendle (fractured right wrist) could be back Thursday.	STAYING PUT	Oakland RHP Tanner Anderson, who allowed two runs over 5 2/3 innings in his first major league start Monday, will get another start. "He was impressive," Melvin said.	IN THE FOLD	The Rays signed SS Greg Jones, who was taken 22nd overall in this year's draft. He hit .341 and stole 42 stolen bases for UNC Wilmington.	SPECIAL DELIVERY	Melvin presented long-time director of team travel Mickey Morabito with a birthday cake that featured a plane with stairs stuck in the wing. Morabito arranged for a new plane Sunday when the original team charter was damaged during a storm while Oakland was playing at Texas.	UP NEXT	Oakland LHP Brett Anderson (6-4) will face Rays RHP Yonny Chirinos (7-2) opener in Wednesday's series finale.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

BOSTON --  Hunter Pence sprinted through his 14th homer of the season, although there was probably no need to hurry.	Pence hit a stand-up, inside-the-park home run and the Texas Rangers beat Boston 9-5 Tuesday night, capitalizing when the Red Sox unraveled after their manager and right fielder were ejected.	"Kind of just a weird incident to be a part of," said Pence, whose fly ball to right in the sixth turned into a surprise two-run homer. "I've never done it, so now I have. It's a good feeling."	Texas has won four of five, including Monday night's extra-innings victory at Fenway Park.	The Red Sox lost their third straight loss and fifth in six games.	"Guys are frustrated. We try not to be, but games like tonight, it's embarrassing," said Brock Holt, who misplayed Pence's homer. "We're not playing well. We're not playing up to our capabilities and that's the frustrating part."	Ariel Jurado (4-2) struck out six while pitching six innings of three-run ball, and Pence, Asdrubal Cabrera and Ronald Guzman each had two RBI for the Rangers.	Xander Bogaerts and Mookie Betts homered for the Red Sox, who dropped to 34-34 on a night filled with frustrations. Andrew Benintendi was ejected in the fifth, and manager Alex Cora was also tossed defending his outfielder.	With Benintendi banished to the clubhouse, Pence took advantage of a realigned outfield.	Holt moved from left field to right in the sixth and couldn't track down Pence's fly at the short right field wall. Holt fell onto the top of the wall and remained draped there while the ball rolled slowly toward right-center. Betts, who moved from right to center, couldn't get to the ball before Pence finished his dash around the bases. That put Texas up 9-3.	"I was watching it probably a little too long because I was like awkwardly around first base, so then I just took off running because I saw the ball," Pence said. "I heard someone saying `slow down, slow down' and I'm like `I'm not slowing down until I see an umpire say something."	Cabrera followed Pence with a line drive to left and tried to stretch it to a double, sliding in and initially being called safe before second base umpire Jordan Baker quickly reversed his own call. That brought Texas manager Chris Woodward storming out of the dugout. He went straight for plate umpire Angel Hernandez and shouted in his face until he got tossed -- the first ejection of his managing career.	Woodward said he was upset because he was considering challenging the call and wasn't told when he had run out of time.	"I just want consistency -- that's all -- from the umpires," Woodward said. "They have a hard job to do. But most umpires give you the ultimatum when it comes down to the 30 seconds. I don't have a 30-second clock in my head -- I'm not that gifted."	Darwinzon Hernandez (0-1) made his first major league start and struck out seven, but he struggled with his control and allowed four runs -- three earned -- on three hits and five walks. He faced two batters in the fourth, when Texas pulled ahead 4-3.	BEEF NIGHT	Although he was ejected by first base umpire Vic Carapazza, Benintendi appeared to be upset with Hernandez. He turned and shouted toward home plate after grounding out, prompting the ejection.	Cora came out to argue and got into it with Carapazza and Hernandez near first base before being given his third career ejection. While Cora yelled at both umpires, Benintendi continued to bark from the top step of the dugout.	Benintendi said it was odd because his complaint was directed at Hernandez.	"I know that Angel didn't hear me," Benintendi said in the clubhouse. "It stinks. We're out there trying to win a game. I want to be a part of it, but can't do that when I'm in here."	Hernandez issued a statement through a pool reporter following the game, saying little to explain the ejections.	"He violated the rules of the game," Hernandez said. "I'm not at liberty to discuss anything until I submit the report tomorrow."	Hernandez said Woodward apparently didn't hear when he was told time was running out to challenge the call.	"We were not going to review the play once time expired," Hernandez said. "These are rules. It's my job to enforce them."	GET WELL, PAPI	Fans cheered between the second and third innings when the Red Sox showed a video from 13 years before, when David Ortiz hit a three-run walk-off homer on June 11, 2006 for the Red Sox in a 5-4 win over Texas.	Ortiz was a few miles away at Massachusetts General Hospital, where he is recovering in intensive care after being flown to Boston for a second surgery following a shooting in the Dominican Republic on Sunday night.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: OF Joey Gallo (strained oblique) hit from a tee Tuesday. Gallo has been on the injured list since June 2.	Red Sox: Placed RHP Ryan Brasier on the bereavement/family medical emergency list. Hernandez was recalled from Double-A Portland. ... 1B/DH Steve Pearce (lower back strain) did some running Tuesday and will take swings Wednesday.	UP NEXT	Rangers RHP Lance Lynn (7-4, 4.39 ERA) faces RHP Rick Porcello (4-6, 4.86) in the third game of the series, which was moved up to a 4 p.m. start because of Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals between the Blues and the Bruins.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

MIAMI --  St. Louis Cardinals rookie Dakota Hudson pitched a career-high seven innings Tuesday night and said teammate Adam Wainwright would be hearing about it.	"Waino always says if you want to get wins, you'd better go seven," Hudson said. "I finally hit that benchmark, so I'll have to give him a call."	While Wainwright is back in St. Louis nursing a minor hamstring injury, Hudson turned in a performance worthy of the longtime ace as the Cardinals handed the Miami Marlins their sixth consecutive defeat, 7-1.	Hudson (5-3) allowed four hits and one run, struck out six and retired 10 in a row during one stretch for the Cardinals, who have won his past five starts.	He said he was glad to go seven innings but doesn't want to be satisfied meeting that goal.	"I'm pushing for nine every time," Hudson said. "I'll just have to keep making a case to be out there as long as possible."	The right-hander has the highest groundball rate in the majors, and 12 of his 21 outs came on grounders. He hasn't given up a homer in 47 innings.	"He controlled counts and threw a heavy ball," manager Mike Shildt said. "He was down with pretty much everything."	Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina returned after missing 11 games because of a strained right thumb and went 2 for 5 with a single and double.	Left fielder Marcell Ozuna made a fine catch with two on in the fourth, and punctuated the victory with a ninth-inning homer , his 18th. He has a career average of .452 (14 for 31) against his former team.	"Ozo is an All-Star with the year he's having," Shildt said.	The Marlins totaled five hits, all singles. They rank last in the majors in runs and have been outscored 31-10 in the past six games.	"When you start losing and everything is going backward, it's really hard to have the same energy as when you're winning," Miami shortstop Miguel Rojas said. "It's really tough to have fun when the team is not doing good around you. That's when we have to be stronger and come here with a different attitude."	Elieser Hernandez (0-1), recalled from Triple-A New Orleans to make his first start of the year, allowed three runs in 5 2/3 innings.	Kolten Wong had two of the Cardinals' 13 hits and reached base four times, and teammate Harrison Bader drove in two runs with a triple and a bases-loaded walk. Dexter Fowler had an RBI single in the seventh and then scored from first on Jose Martinez's pinch-hit two-run single.	OUT OF THE GAME	Hudson, who struck out three times, joked that he might have pitched longer if not for his batting. He threw 93 pitches and departed for a pinch hitter with the Cardinals leading 4-1.	"I think we got in a situation where they didn't want me to strike out again," Hudson said with a chuckle.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: RHP Jose Urena (lower back tightness) was scratched from his scheduled start Wednesday and may go on the injured list. The ailment surfaced after he threw a bullpen session Monday. ... RHP Riley Ferrell (right biceps tendinitis) joined Class A Jupiter on a rehab assignment.	NEW ADDITION	The Cardinals signed their first-round draft choice, LHP Zack Thompson of Kentucky, and announced they had agreed to terms with seven other picks.	UP NEXT	Cardinals: RHP Miles Mikolas (4-6, 4.54) is scheduled to start the series finale Wednesday when the Cardinals try for a sweep. He started twice against the Marlins last year and won both games.	Marlins: RHP Jordan Yamamoto, acquired in the Christian Yelich trade in January 2018, is expected to be recalled from Double-A Jacksonville to make his major league debut as Urena's replacement. Yamamoto is 3-5 with a 3.58 ERA in 12 starts for Jacksonville.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	---	Follow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve-Wine	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ATLANTA --  Now that his knee is healthy, Brian McCann showed he has plenty of power left at 35 years old.	McCann hit one of four Atlanta homers in the second inning and took Pirates starter Chris Archer deep again with a tiebreaking, three-run shot in the sixth to help the Braves beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 7-5 on Tuesday night.	"It probably hurt me for a little bit there, but once I got it fixed and I came back in September last year, I knew I could make an aggressive move on the baseball," he said. "I'm healthy. I feel good. Got my bat speed back."	The Braves, tied for first in the NL East, have won five straight. The game was called following a 1-hour, 48-minute rain delay after eight innings.	McCann put the Braves up 7-4 in the sixth, pulling a fastball into the right-field seats. He made a winner of Touki Toussaint (4-0), who relieved after another ineffective start by Mike Foltynewicz.	The Braves hit four homers off Archer to take a 4-2 lead in the second as Josh Donaldson and Nick Markakis went back-to-back and were followed one batter later by McCann and Ozzie Albies.	Donaldson's ninth homer ricocheted off the right-field foul pole, and Markakis followed with a 417-foot homer to center, his sixth of the year. McCann's opposite-field shot sailed into left-center. He was followed by Albies, who pulled his 10th homer into the right-field seats.	"We have speed, we're athletic, we make you throw strikes," said McCann, who's back with the Braves after five years in the AL. "We're tough to get through on a nightly basis from top to bottom, so it's nice to show it again tonight."	Archer gave up seven runs and eight hits with two walks while striking out eight in six innings. He had won two straight starts after dropping five in a row. His five homers allowed were a single-game career high.	"Man, I was throwing stuff right down the middle," Archer said. "No matter how hard you're throwing, how good your stuff was the inning before or the game before, if you throw stuff down the middle, you're going to get blasted and they're an aggressive team. They jumped me. I didn't make the adjustment. That was pretty much the ballgame."	Foltynewicz's ERA rose 13 points to 6.02. He threw a wild pitch that advanced two runners in the first and trailed 2-0 on Josh Bell's two-run single. He began the third by walking the pitcher. He walked Bell to begin the fourth and allowed him to score when Colin Moran's double made it 4-3.	The Pirates tied it at 4-all in the fifth when Kevin Newman singled, advanced to third on Corey Dickerson's single and scored on a grounder.

HOUSTON --  Yordan Alvarez's teammates told the slugger they'd fine him if he didn't homer in his first game for the Houston Astros.	After he connected in his debut they warned him that the fine would be double if he didn't knock one out of the park in Game 2.	So far, Alvarez isn't out a dime.	Alvarez hit one of Houston's four home runs to become the first player in franchise history to homer in his first two major league games and lead the Astros to a 10-8 win over the Milwaukee Brewers on Tuesday night.	"It's something incredible and emotional. I can barely describe it, to be able to hit two home runs in my first two games in the big leagues," Alvarez said through a translator.	Yuli Gurriel, Robinson Chirinos and Tyler White also homered for the Astros, who won for the fourth time in five games.	Houston led by one in the fifth when Michael Brantley hit a run-scoring triple to chase Freddy Peralta (3-3). He was replaced by Matt Albers, who was greeted with a single by Gurriel which pushed the lead to 6-3. Alvarez then knocked a changeup by Albers into the right field seats to extend the lead to 8-3.	The 21-year-old Alvarez, who led the Pacific Coast League with 23 homers, also had a two-run shot in his debut on Sunday. He is the first player since Trevor Story in 2016 to homer for the first two hits of his career.	Manager AJ Hinch was impressed with how Alvarez bounced back with his homer run after striking out in his first two at-bats on Tuesday night.	"I haven't been around him enough to see how he really responds to the success or failure," Hinch said. "But after the couple of punch outs, he stays on the ball, he's got tremendous strength ... it was a nice swing. We needed as many runs as we could get tonight."	Travis Shaw hit a solo homer for the Brewers in the seventh before a two-run home run by Chirinos in the bottom of the inning extended Houston's lead to 10-4.	The Brewers added a run on a bases-loaded walk in the eighth and got within two on Yasmani Grandal's three-run homer off Chris Devenski with two outs in the ninth. But Devenski struck out Eric Thames to end it.	Houston starter Brad Peacock (6-3) yielded seven hits and four runs in 6 1/3 innings for the win.	Peralta took the loss by giving up eight hits and six runs in four-plus innings.	"I thought some of the pitches were good ... sometimes that's concerning too, just because they're hitting your good pitches, that's trouble," manager Craig Counsell said. "He threw strikes again. He attacked. That part I liked. Obviously, the home runs and the driven balls got him."	Christian Yelich hit his MLB-leading 25th home run and finished a triple shy of the cycle as Milwaukee's four-game winning streak was snapped. It was his second straight game with a home run and extended his hitting streak to a season-high nine games.	"I could not see Yelich hit again and I'd be fine," Hinch said. "He's really good."	The Brewers led 1-0 early after an RBI single by Grandal with two outs in the first inning. Tony Kemp singled with one out in the second before White put the Astros on top 2-1 with his opposite-field shot to the seats in right.	Yelich homered to the bullpen in right-center to start the third and tie it at 2-2.	Houston regained the lead when Brantley doubled before Gurriel's fifth home run this season made it 4-2. Gurriel had three hits and drove in three runs.	Orlando Arcia singled to start the fifth and scored on a double by Ben Gamel to get the Brewers within 1 before Houston's big fifth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: RHP Jhoulys Chacin (lower back strain) threw an extended bullpen session of about 50 pitches on Tuesday. Counsell said he expects him to come off the injured list to start during their series in San Diego, which begins on Monday.	Astros: Hinch said 2B Jose Altuve (leg fatigue) is "doing great" and they expect him to be ready to begin a rehabilitation assignment this weekend. ... OF George Springer (hamstring) is improving and took batting practice on the field on Tuesday. Hinch said he's a little behind Altuve, but he could start a rehabilitation assignment late this weekend. ... INF Aledmys Diaz (hamstring) had a setback recently while running and has been shut down. Hinch said he doesn't think the setback is serious, but isn't sure how long it will keep him out. ... C Max Stassi (knee soreness) is scheduled to begin a rehabilitation assignment on Thursday.	ROBBIE'S JUNE	Chirinos has five home runs this month, which is tied for second-most in the majors. He has 11 home runs in 50 games this season after finishing with a career-best 18 in 113 games last year.	UP NEXT	Brewers: RHP Brandon Woodruff (8-1, 3.87 ERA) is scheduled to start for Milwaukee on Wednesday night. Woodruff allowed four hits and three runs while striking out 10 in his last start against Pittsburgh to win his seventh straight decision.	Astros: RHP Justin Verlander (9-2, 2.40) will start for Houston on Wednesday. Verlander yielded five hits and three runs with seven strikeouts in six innings in his last start but did not factor into the decision in Houston's 8-7 win over Seattle in 14 innings.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

CHICAGO --  Eloy Jimenez believes he's much improved since the start of the season and will continue to grow throughout his rookie year.	Welington Castillo hit a grand slam and Jimenez homered at home for the first time, powering the Chicago White Sox to a 7-5 win over the Washington Nationals on Tuesday night.	Castillo got his second career slam, with the other coming June 14, 2017, in the same ballpark when he played for the Baltimore Orioles.	Jimenez went 2 for 3 with two RBI and three runs. He drove a 1-1 pitch from Washington starter Patrick Corbin (5-5) over the batter's eye in center and onto the concourse for an estimated distance of 462 feet. The 22-year-old came into the game hitting .266 with no homers and three RBI in 18 home games and .205 with eight homers and 14 RBI in 23 road games.	"I know I'm getting better," he said. "This is pretty much one of my best games, but there's more to come."	Jimenez also made a nice sliding catch on a liner to left in the eighth to help thwart a Nationals comeback attempt.	Anthony Rendon homered twice for the Nationals, who snapped a three-game winning streak.	Corbin allowed seven runs on six hits in five innings in losing his third straight start.	"It's just been frustrating trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong," he said. "I just gotta make better pitches out there, execute and just try to get better results."	Reliever Evan Marshall (1-0) retired all four batters he faced to get the win. Marshall replaced starter Manny Banuelos with two outs and two on in the fifth and got Howie Kendrick to line out to third.	Alex Colome got the final five outs -- working out of a bases-loaded jam in the eighth -- for his 14th save in 14 chances.	Rendon's two-run shot with one out in the first gave the Nationals a quick 2-0 lead.	Chicago answered in the bottom half of the inning. Jose Abreu doubled off the wall with two outs and James McCann and Jimenez followed with walks to load the bases. Castillo then drove a 2-0 fastball from Corbin over the wall in center for a 4-2 lead.	Corbin retired the next seven batters before Jimenez led off the fourth with his long homer to make it 5-2.	In the sixth, Jimenez chased Corbin with an RBI double for a 6-2 lead. Yolmer Sanchez then drove in Jimenez with an RBI single to make it 7-2.	Washington pulled within three in the eighth on a two-run double by Yan Gomes off reliever Aaron Bummer. Later in the inning, the Nationals loaded the bases with two outs, but Colome got Adam Eaton to fly out to center.	Rendon led off the ninth with his second homer to cap the scoring.	ACT YOUR AGE	Jimenez's tape-measure shots -- he also had a similar one to center in Kansas City over the weekend -- has caught the attention of his teammates, including slugger Abreu.	"He says I'm not 22-years-old because I hit a ball too far," Jimenez said.	WEB GEM	Center fielder Victor Robles had the defensive play of the game with a diving catch on the warning track to take an extra base hit away from Chicago's Leury Garcia.	HEAD'S UP	Plate umpire Chad Whitson was struck in the head on a backswing by Chicago's Ryan Cordell in the second inning. After receiving treatment for several minutes by the White Sox training staff, Whitson was able to continue.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: 1B Matt Adams sat out with a left oblique strain suffered on a check swing Monday, but manager Dave Martinez is optimistic Adams will just miss the one game. "He's a lot better than we anticipated," Martinez said.	White Sox: 3B Yoan Moncada was out of the lineup after leaving Monday's game after the sixth inning. He's listed as day-to-day with a mild mid lat-back strain. "He's doing better today," manager Rick Renteria said. "We'll continue to monitor him. We have a day off tomorrow and we'll reevaluate him on Thursday."	UP NEXT	Nationals: RHP Erick Fedde (1-0, 2.93 ERA) starts Thursday night in the opener of a four-game home series against Arizona. RHP Zack Greinke (7-2, 2.87) goes for the Diamondbacks.	White Sox: RHP Ivan Nova (3-5, 6.28 ERA) takes the mound Thursday night in the opener of a four-game home series against the Yankees. LHP J.A. Happ (6-3, 4.48) pitches for New York.	---	More AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

MINNEAPOLIS --  This barrage of home runs has helped propel the Minnesota Twins to the best record in baseball.	There's plenty of speed to supplement the power, too, as Jorge Polanco proved again.	Polanco scored the tying run on a wild pitch and Marwin Gonzalez hit the go-ahead RBI single during a three-run rally in the eighth inning , giving the surging Twins a 6-5 victory over the slumping Seattle Mariners on Tuesday night.	"We never quit. We can score many runs in one inning," Gonzalez said, "and every time that's why we don't give up."	Polanco, who took over the league lead in batting average at .341, reached base all four times he batted. He tried for a hustle double on each of his three hits, beating the tag at second base twice. That included the eighth against reliever Brandon Brennan (2-5), when Polanco followed Max Kepler's leadoff double with his own on a head-first slide to cut the lead to 5-4.	"All of their teammates on the bench appreciate it when they see something like that, but it's those guys wanting it," said manager Rocco Baldelli, whose team leads the AL with 144 doubles. "You have to run hard out of the box, and we have several guys that do that. They think double every time they hit a ball in the gap."	After advancing on a long fly out by Eddie Rosario, Polanco raced home on a stray slider by Austin Adams that skipped in the dirt past catcher Tom Murphy. Gonzalez then put the Twins in front with his sharp single, clapping his hands as he pointed to an exuberant home dugout during the sprint to first.	The Mariners started the ninth with two singles against Trevor May, but the hard-throwing right-hander notched his first save of the season by striking out Edwin Encarnacion looking and then retiring the next two batters. Matt Magill (2-0) pitched a perfect eighth for the Twins, who have won 19 of their last 25 games.	As May warmed up in the bullpen, he said, a feeling the rally would come was palpable.	"That's the team you want to be on, the team where everybody can't wait to be the guy to do it that night," May said, adding: "It's ridiculous. It truly is the most fun team I've ever been on."	The called third strike on Encarnacion by home plate umpire Mike Estabrook was down and away, which the AL home run leader believed was low and outside.	"You want to get your work done, but we're human," Encarnacion said. "I know it was a ball, but there's nothing you can do."	Encarnacion gave the Mariners a third-inning lead with a three-run home run off starter Martin Perez, after reaching the 400-homer mark for his career in the previous game. A two-out infield single by Mallex Smith started the rally, putting starter Mike Leake in position for a third straight victory after logging 16 innings with just three runs allowed over his previous two turns.	With the team playing at home for the first time in two weeks, the Twins rolled out new red "Bomba Squad" T-shirts to tout their newfound power with a fan giveaway and played a siren sound effect over the ballpark speakers after each homer.	The Twins, who entered the evening with the second-most homers in the major leagues, muscled their way back in the fourth inning. Jonathan Schoop hit a two-run home run, and Jason Castro followed with the tying solo shot. That gave the Twins their seventh set of back-to-back homers this year , matching the Mariners for the most in baseball.	"Their lineup top to bottom is tough to get through," Mariners manager Scott Servais said. "I thought Mike Leake did a great job."	Daniel Vogelbach's RBI single against Perez, who has logged only 17 1/3 innings over his last four starts, put the Mariners back in front. Then Kyle Seager made it 5-3 with an RBI single in the seventh against Ryne Harper.	DOUBLE E	Encarnacion hit his 21st home run of the season and the 16th of his career at Target Field, the second-most by a visiting player in the 10-year history of the facility. Salvador Perez has hit 17 homers here for the Kansas City Royals.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: 2B Dee Gordon (bruised right wrist) returned to the lineup after a 19-game absence, bringing the number of players on the injured list down to 10. Servais said SS J.P. Crawford (sprained left ankle) will likely be the next reinstatement when the team starts a series in Oakland on Friday, provided he finishes a rehab assignment with Class A Modesto this week unscathed. Crawford has missed the last 13 games.	Twins: LHP Taylor Rogers, who has taken some of the turns in the ninth behind primary closer Blake Parker, was unavailable because of minor back tightness.	UP NEXT	Mariners: LHP Tommy Milone (1-1, 3.10 ERA) will be the primary pitcher on Wednesday night, with a to-be-determined reliever serving as the opener. Servais announced that LHP Yusei Kikuchi will start on Thursday afternoon.	Twins: RHP Jose Berrios (8-2, 3.14 ERA) will take the mound for the middle game of the series. He has completed at least six innings in 11 of 13 turns this season.	---	More AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.

The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Adalberto Mondesi and Terrance Gore used their speed to help the Kansas City Royals rally for a win.	Mondesi and Jorge Soler had consecutive one-out doubles in the eighth inning to tie it, and pinch-runner Gore stole third and scored the go-ahead run on Cheslor Cuthbert's ensuing single to lead the Royals to a 3-2 victory over the Detroit Tigers on Tuesday night.	Kansas City manager Ned Yost credited Mondesi for "a hustle double" -- for his third hit of the game -- to start the rally. He then scored on Soler's hit off Victor Alcantara (2-1). Gore ran for Soler, stole third and scored on Cuthbert's single between three fielders in right field to give the Royals their first lead of the game.	"Cuthbert got a break on that one, hit a pop-up into no-man's land," Yost said. "That's the first break we've caught in a while, but I'll take it."	Detroit manager Ron Gardenhire agreed with Yost's assessment of the go-ahead run.	"I guess it's no-man's land," Gardenhire said. "Somebody has to take charge on the ball. With us playing the infield in, it bloops out there. The ball landed and that was just a break for them."	It was the first time all season the Kansas City won when trailing after six innings.	Mondesi had rounded first aggressively on his first two hits before heading back to the bag. With his club down a run, he didn't hesitate on his last hit.	"Every time I hit the ball I run hard," Mondesi said. "When I hit it I saw the left fielder was in the gap, so I thought I had a chance. I just ran hard."	Scott Barlow (2-2) pitched a scoreless eighth inning to get the win, and Ian Kennedy got the last three outs for his fifth save.	The Tigers' bullpen wasted a brilliant effort from Spencer Turnbull. He scattered four hits and two walks with five strikeouts over six innings. It was only the third time in 14 starts that Turnbull had not allowed a run.	Jakob Junis had a quality start for Kansas City, allowing two runs and five hits -- including solo homers by Nicholas Castellanos and Brandon Dixon -- with five strikeouts in seven innings.	"We had a pretty good game plan and we executed it," Junis said. "We had a couple of mistakes, but luckily they were solos. That kept us in the game. I wanted to challenge them. I got behind a couple of times. I didn't want to put anybody on with a free base. Those were huge."	The Tigers got to Junis in the first on a 427-foot home run by Castellanos to left-center. It was Castellanos' 100th career homer, all with the Tigers. It marked the ninth time in 14 starts that Junis gave up a run in the first inning.	Dixon hit a 447-foot homer in the fourth, into the fountains 20 feet beyond where Castellanos' homer traveled, to put the Tigers up 2-0.	"(Junis) made some mistakes, center-cut two fastballs, but he did an awesome job of keeping us in the game," Yost said. "He gave us an opportunity to come back and win the game."	Following Turnbull's departure, Ryan O'Hearn led off the seventh with his sixth home run of the season. He broke an 0-for-15 slump with his 439-foot blast to right.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals 3B Hunter Dozier was eligible to come off the 10-day injured list, but he is not close to being ready. He's been on the IL since June 3, retroactive to May 31. Manager Ned Yost said, "We're going to be working him back into it, making sure everything is functional and feeling good. We've got to make sure that he's healthy, 100 percent. I don't know if we'll want to send him out on a rehab. When he's ready to go we'll make that decision."	Tigers: SS Niko Goodrum was removed from the game following the top of the third after he fouled a pitch off his knee. He left with a right knee contusion. He finished the at-bat with a strikeout and was replaced by Gordon Beckham in the bottom of the third.	UP NEXT	The Tigers will send LHP Daniel Norris (2-5, 4.60 ERA) to the mound in the second game of the series. The Royals will counter with LHP Danny Duffy (3-3, 4.68 ERA). Duffy was hit on the right kneecap in his last start against Boston. The line drive bounced to third for the final out of the second inning. He came back out for the third but retired just one of six batters he faced in the inning before being pulled.	---	More AP baseball coverage: www.apnews.com/MLB and www.twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

DENVER --  Peter Lambert baffled Chicago yet again and took a chunk out of the turf with a sliding catch.	Now that's making an impression.	The rookie went five strong innings to lock up Chicago for a second time in five days as the Colorado Rockies won their 10th straight at home by beating the Cubs 10-3 on Tuesday night.	"He was getting outs," Cubs shortstop Javier Baez simply explained. "Things went their way."	Lambert (2-0) allowed one run and three hits in his Coors Field debut. The right-hander made his first major league start last Thursday at Wrigley Field and earned his first win when he pitched seven innings of one-run ball.	He went with a similar game plan for meeting No. 2. With good reason: It worked so well the first time.	"Go out there and get ahead of hitters and keep the ball down," Lambert explained of his approach. "Keep our team in the ball game as long as I can."	Daniel Murphy led the Rockies offense with three hits, including a two-run double in the first. Charlie Blackmon added a three-run homer as part of a five-run sixth to break open the game.	Lambert mixed in several offspeed pitches with a four-seam fastball to keep the Cubs off balance. Lambert's only mistake was a fastball that Jason Heyward lined to left for a solo homer in the second.	That's about all the damage the Cubs could muster.	"We have not figured him out well," Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. "I'm not going to denigrate him; I think he's pretty good."	Lambert left his mark on the field, too. He sprinted off the mound on a pop foul in the fourth and dove for the ball near the first-base dugout. In the process, Lambert's left knee dug deep into the turf. He momentarily limped around before taking a few warmup tosses with a very noticeable grass stain near the knee of his white pants.	He insisted he was fine, though.	"Instinctively, you know if something's wrong or if you're OK," Rockies manager Bud Black said. "I asked him that and he said, `Buddy, I'm ok.' I said, `OK."	Soon after, the knee began to bother Lambert. His 83rd and final pitch of the night was a fastball that struck out Anthony Rizzo. Then, he turned it over to the bullpen.	"I thought it went well. Pitching here at Coors Field was pretty awesome, in front of the home crowd," Lambert said. "I thought I made some good pitches when I needed to."	Chicago lefty Jose Quintana (4-6) allowed four runs, three earned, over 4 2/3 innings. He also took the loss in Lambert's debut.	The Cubs have now dropped five straight on the road. They're now 13-18 away from home.	"There are no excuses losing games," Javier Baez said. "If we win, fine. If not, we've got to come the next day and make adjustments."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: Reliever Craig Kimbrel threw a second bullpen session Monday in Arizona and will toss batting practice later in the week. The right-hander is steadily working his way back into form after recently finalizing a three-year contract with Chicago.	Rockies: LHP Tyler Anderson underwent surgery on his left knee Tuesday in Chicago.	THIS & THAT	Cubs 3B Kris Bryant was hit twice by Lambert. ... Murphy was thrown out twice on the bases. ...  Colorado's 10th straight home win is the team's longest at Coors Field in one season since 11 in a row in 1996. ... LHP Phillip Diehl made his major league debut in the ninth and allowed two runs. ... OF Ian Desmond tied a season high with three hits.	GOING DEEP	Broncos fullback Andy Janovich won a charity home run contest before the game using a bat he borrowed from Trevor Story.	"He's athletic and strong so he can create some whip for sure," Story said.	The third annual UCHealth "Healthy Swings Charity Home Run Derby" was in support of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. It raised around $100,000.	UP NEXT	Cubs lefty Cole Hamels (5-2, 3.24 ERA) will start the series finale Wednesday. The Rockies will throw right-hander Antonio Senzatela (5-4, 4.95).	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

SAN FRANCISCO --  A timely hit by Evan Longoria and a gutsy decision by third base coach Ron Wotus provided just enough momentum for the San Francisco Giants to get past another round of missed opportunities at the plate.	It also helped manager Bruce Bochy's club overcome a wacky play when the Giants failed to make the final out of the fifth inning three times on a ball that never left the infield.	Longoria hit a go-ahead, two-run double in the seventh inning and made a stellar defensive play in the ninth, and the Giants rallied to beat the San Diego Padres 6-5 on Tuesday night.	"What a huge hit," Bochy said. "That's what we've been looking for. If you look at the last three games, even earlier in this game, we had trouble getting that big hit. We needed some help at that point and Longo delivered in a big way. Great game, coming off a couple tough ones."	The Giants entered the day with the second-worst home record in the majors at 11-20 and trailed 4-3 before scoring three times off the Padres bullpen.	Pinch-hitter Brandon Belt drew a leadoff walk against Trey Wingenter (0-1) and went to third on Joe Panik's single. After Mike Yastrzemski flew out, Longoria lined a 1-1 pitch past left fielder Wil Myers. Belt scored and Panik slid in safely with a headfirst dive to beat the throw home from Tatis.	Wotus made the decision to wave Panik around after being cautious earlier in the game.	"Honestly it was time to take a chance," Wotus said. "If I stopped another one, I think I would have gotten booed out of the place."	Pablo Sandoval followed with a sacrifice fly to score Longoria.	Steven Duggar hit a home run for San Francisco, his first since mid-April.	Fernando Tatis Jr. homered on the first pitch of the game and drove in two for San Diego. Ian Kinsler also went deep but the Padres were done in by their bullpen after a solid start by Chris Paddack.	"You go through these phases in the season where your bullpen's a little snake-bit," San Diego manager Andy Green said. "It happens to most every team at some point in time. We like Trey. He's done a lot of good things for us."	Mark Melancon (3-1) retired three batters to win. Will Smith pitched a 1-2-3 ninth for his 15th save in 15 tries. Longoria backed Smith with a leaping grab on Manuel Margot's hard liner for the second out of the inning.	The Giants needed it all after the strange play in the fifth when the Padres loaded the bases with two outs.	Eric Hosmer hit a sharp comebacker off reliever Trevor Gott that knocked Gott's glove off his hand. The right-hander quickly retrieved the ball, but his throw to first was late and wide and pulled Sandoval off the bag as Chris Paddack scored. Tatis, who drove in the first run of the inning with an infield single, rounded third then made a headfirst slide into home to beat Sandoval's throw. Giants catcher Stephen Vogt threw to third but not in time to get Manny Machado.	"It looked like we were taking infield there for a second," Bochy said.	Gott watched a replay and said shortstop Brandon Crawford likely would have made a play had Gott not intervened.	"A ball coming back at you, it's kind of reflex to try to get a glove on it or knock it down," Gott said. "I tried to throw it. I don't know if I should (have) but I was trying to save an inning. It was an interesting play."	San Francisco's Tyler Beede had a career-high seven strikeouts in 4 2/3 innings but allowed four runs on five hits.	TRAINERS ROOM	Padres: Austin Hedges started at catcher after sitting out two games with a sprained left ankle. Hedges went 0 for 4 with two strikeouts. ... RHP Dinelson Lamet had five strikeouts in four scoreless innings of a rehab start with Class A Lake Elsinore. Lamet is working his way back after undergoing Tommy John surgery in April 2018.	Giants: C Buster Posey is expected to come off the 10-day injured list Wednesday. The six-time All-Star has been out with a right hamstring strain he suffered in Baltimore on June 1. Posey was placed on the IL four days later, with the move retroactive to June 2. ... Belt was held out of the starting lineup with a sore neck he apparently suffered swinging in the batting cage during Sunday's loss to the Dodgers.	UP NEXT	Padres LHP Joey Lucchesi (5-3, 4.21 ERA) takes a two-game winning streak into Wednesday's start. Lucchesi pitched into the sixth inning to beat San Francisco on March 29. RHP Shaun Anderson (1-1, 4.18) pitches for the Giants in his first career start against San Diego.	--	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Shohei Ohtani's latest big homer kicked off a five-run rally for the Los Angeles Angels in the first inning. With plenty of gutsy relief pitching, they managed to make that lead stand up for the whole game.	The Dodgers' profoundly frustrating night got even worse in the ninth inning when Corey Seager came up limping.	Ohtani and Justin Bour homered off Kenta Maeda in the first, and the Angels swept the two-game Freeway Series with a 5-3 victory over the Dodgers on Tuesday night.	Another sellout crowd at the Big A witnessed the conclusion of an uncommonly satisfying two-game set for the Angels, who have hovered below .500 for most of the season while their glamorous LA rivals have been the majors' best team.	"It was a great game to play in," Bour said. "A lot of fans came out for that close win last night, and we just rode it on."	This meeting got interesting early and late.	The Angels jumped on Maeda (7-3) for all of their runs in their first seven batters. After Ohtani homered against a fellow Japanese star for the second time in four days, Bour hit a three-run homer in his first plate appearance following his return from a three-week banishment to the minors.	While the Angels couldn't score after that, the Dodgers stranded 15 runners and lost Seager to a potentially serious hamstring strain while losing consecutive games for only the second time since April 23-24.	Seager led off the ninth with a single, and he was preparing to round third on Alex Verdugo's single when he injured his leg. The shortstop pulled up in pain and walked off the field with what was tentatively diagnosed as a "Grade 2-plus" hamstring strain, according to manager Dave Roberts.	"With what he's done to overcome a couple of surgeries and get into playing shape, you feel real bad for Corey," Roberts said of Seager, who missed five months of the last regular season and the playoffs following Tommy John surgery.	Seager said he will have an MRI exam Wednesday.	"Just coming around third, it grabbed pretty good," Seager said. "Just kind of one bad step, I guess."	Max Muncy hit two homers for the Dodgers, who hadn't lost a series since April 29-May 1 in San Francisco.	David Freese delivered a pinch-hit homer leading off the eighth inning, but Hansel Robles got five perilous outs for his ninth save.	After Seager left, Robles struck out Chris Taylor and Enrique Hernandez before getting Russell Martin on a groundout to close the Angels' third win in four games.	Robles and Ty Buttrey battled through the final three innings, providing a rare evening of satisfaction for the Angels' up-and-down bullpen.	"I did ask a little bit more (from Buttrey and Robles)," Angels manager Brad Ausmus said. "But I felt like that's what we had to do to win the game."	Three games after Ohtani homered off Seattle's Yusei Kikuchi, the slugger took Maeda deep to right for his seventh homer. The Angels added Brian Goodwin's RBI single and a three-run shot by Bour, who returned from Triple-A Salt Lake in style after getting off to a .163 start in his first season with the Angels.	After Cam Bedrosian opened, Felix Pena (4-1) gave up both of Muncy's homers and six hits over 3 2/3 innings.	FUNKY MUNCY	Two days after Muncy's much-discussed homer and a subsequent not-so-friendly chat with San Francisco's Madison Bumgarner, he connected for solo shots in the third and fifth innings, giving him 15 homers this season -- 11 on the road.	MEDIOCRE MAEDA	Although Maeda didn't yield a hit or a run after the first inning, he lasted just 4 1/3 innings in the pitching-rich Dodgers' shortest start since May 4. Maeda had given up only six total runs in his past five starts.	Through a translator, Maeda said Ohtani's homer "was just a solo shot after two outs, so it didn't really affect me (mentally)."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: Lefty reliever Scott Alexander went on the injured list with left forearm inflammation. The club recalled LHP Caleb Ferguson from Triple-A Oklahoma City, and he pitched 1 2/3 innings of two-hit relief.	Angels: OF Justin Upton played his fourth straight minor league game in his comeback from turf toe, which has sidelined him for the entire season. Upton could return during the Angels' road trip. ... SS Andrelton Simmons is nearly ready to face live pitching in his return from a sprained left ankle. He hopes to return this month.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: After a day off to attend a charity gala at Dodger Stadium featuring a performance by Bruno Mars, the major league leaders send Clayton Kershaw (5-1, 3.00 ERA) to the mound in Chavez Ravine against the Cubs to open an 11-game homestand.	Angels: After a late-night flight and a day off in Tampa, Tyler Skaggs (4-6, 4.97 ERA) takes the mound in the first of four against the Rays to kick off an 11-game road trip.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Ramon Laureano helped the Oakland Athletics end a long stay away from home in grand fashion.	Laureano hit his first career grand slam to break an eighth-inning tie and finished with five RBI and the Athletics beat the Tampa Bay Rays 6-2 on Wednesday.	"I was just trying to put the ball in the air and at least get one run but I got four," Laureano said. "I just saw the umpire (signal) home run, and then I'm like `it's cool."	Oakland went 6-4, including taking two of three from the Rays, on a season-long 10-game road trip that included some significant travel issues.	The Athletics didn't arrive in Florida until after 3 a.m. Monday. They spent 3 1/2 hours in the clubhouse following their game at the Texas Rangers on Sunday because of storm-related damage to their plane.	"It kind of shows you what these guys are made of," Oakland manager Bob Melvin said. "They really do just play for the day. You add them all up at the end of this trip, it was an excellent trip."	Yandy Diaz and Tommy Pham both had three hits for the Rays, who are 18-16 at home and dropped one-half game behind the idle AL East-leading New York Yankees.	Matt Olson started the decisive eighth with a single off Adam Kolarek (2-2). Chaz Roe entered and after striking out Khris Davis, the right-hander walked Stephen Piscotty and then intentionally walked Robbie Grossman after a wild pitch moved the runners to second and third.	Laureano made it 6-2 by sending a 2-2 pitch from Colin Poche into the left-field stands.	Oakland took a 1-0 lead in the fourth on a two-out infield single by Laureano. He also stole two bases.	"There's some different facets to his game," Melvin said.	Athletics starter Brett Anderson left in the seventh with two on and one out and the Athletics up 2-0.	Tampa Bay tied it at 2 when Diaz greeted Liam Hendriks (3-0) with an RBI double and Avisail Garcia added a run-scoring infield single.	Anderson was charged with two runs and seven hits in 6 1/3 innings.	Olson homered for the second consecutive game, a solo shot off Yonny Chirinos in the sixth that put Oakland ahead 2-0.	"I thought he was really good, made some big pitches," Rays manager Kevin Cash said. "We just came up short with the bats, but Yonny did his part for sure."	Olson's previous at-bat played a role in Melvin being ejected by plate umpire Sean Barber for arguing balls and strikes.	Melvin was tossed while Tampa Bay's Austin Meadows was batting in the third, which came after Olson expressed his displeasure with Barber about an inning-ending called third strike with two on in the top of the inning.	Chirinos, coming off eight shutout innings at Boston on Friday, allowed two runs and seven hits in six innings. Working as a starter in his past four appearances and not entering following an opener, the right-hander has given up six runs over 24 1/3 innings.	"The results didn't come out like we wanted," Chirinos said through a translator. "We didn't win."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: C Chris Herrmann (right knee surgery) will start a rehab assignment Thursday with Triple-A Las Vegas.	Rays: Meadows started after fouling a ball hard off his lower right leg Tuesday night in the eighth inning.	MINORS' MATTERS	Oakland pitching prospects A.J. Puk (Tommy John surgery) and Jesus Luzardo (shoulder) made their season debuts with Class A Stockton Tuesday night. Puk allowed one run, one hit and struck out four in two innings, while Luzardo gave up two hits over three scoreless innings. "Puk's first four pitches were 99 (mph)," Melvin said. "Luzardo was up to 97 (mph). So, everybody was pretty happy about the way things went."	UP NEXT	Athletics: RHP Chris Bassitt (3-2) will start the opener of a season-long 10-game homestand Friday night against Seattle.	Rays: LHP Ryan Yarbrough (5-2) will go against Los Angeles Angels LHP Tyler Skaggs (4-6) Thursday night.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

CLEVELAND --  The Reds got off to a scorching start at the plate before experiencing a scare in the field.	Manager David Bell was grateful his team survived it.	"We got lucky," he said.	Rookie Nick Senzel and Joey Votto hit back-to-back home runs to open the game before Senzel and Jose Peraza walked away unhurt following a violent collision in the outfield as the Reds beat the Cleveland Indians 7-2 on Wednesday.	The quick homers by Senzel and Votto -- the first to start a game for Cincinnati since 2001 -- off rookie Zach Plesac (1-2) marked the first time an opposing team began with back-to-back homers in Cleveland in 118 years.	It set the tone for the Reds, who earned a split of the two-game series between Ohio's teams and snapped an eight-game losing streak in interleague play.	Eugenio Suarez and Curt Casali also homered for Cincinnati.	Anthony DeSclafani (3-3) made the early run support stand, allowing one run and four hits in 5 2/3 innings to snap a five-start winless streak.	Carlos Santana hit his 14th homer for Cleveland, which concluded a homestand at 5-3.	There were fans still finding their seats when Senzel and Votto jumped on Plesac, who got his first major league win on Friday against the New York Yankees.	Senzel drove Plesac's fourth pitch onto the pedestrian patio beyond the left-field wall for his fifth homer. The Reds had just wrapped up congratulating him in the dugout when Votto, serving as designated hitter for the fourth time in his career, hit a 3-2 pitch into the right-field stands for his sixth homer.	Those two bangs were followed by another loud one in the bottom of the inning when Senzel and second baseman Jose Peraza had a frightening crash in center field.	Indians leadoff hitter Francisco Lindor sent a bloop into the outfield that Senzel caught on the run before slamming into a charging Peraza.	Senzel took the worst of the impact as he was struck in the face by Peraza's elbow. Senzel crumpled to the ground and shortstop Jose Iglesias waved to the dugout to get his teammate quick medical attention.	Both players avoided serious injury and stayed in the game.	"It happens when you're trying to get outs," Senzel said. "I have a better chance coming in on the ball than he does going back. Right off the jump you can't call it because you don't know if you can catch it. Then you're going for it. You call him off. It was just too late."	As Lindor's ball got deeper, Bell braced himself.	"That play is always going to be scary because they're both going after the ball," Bell said. "They did a pretty good job of avoiding each other -- at least where it wasn't serious, but it could have been. As it turns out they're both going to be fine."	Peraza later delivered an RBI double in the fifth to give the Reds a 3-1 lead.	Suarez led off the sixth with 15th homer and the third surrendered by Plesac, who had allowed just two in his previous three starts.	Plesac hung around until the sixth, but the first-inning homers were costly.	"That's the first time it's ever happened," he said. "It's just, `Get back to it and lock back in.' I battled a full count the next hitter and had to throw, execute a pitch in the zone. I didn't want to walk him and he was ready and turned on it and got it over the fence. It was a good at-bat. He came ready to swing and then I locked back in after that at-bat."	BACK-TO-BACK JACKS	The last time the Reds began a game with consecutive homers was on June 26, 2001, when Alex Ochoa and Hall of Famer Barry Larkin connected against St. Louis' Andy Benes.	TREADING WATER	Despite a successful homestand, the Indians didn't gain ground on first-place Minnesota.	"We're competing," manager Terry Francona said. "We make some mistakes. But as long as they keep playing and trying to get better, we have to do that. And we will."	GET OUTTA HERE	Reds hitting coach Turner Ward was ejected in the second inning for arguing after Iglesias struck out.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: Votto was replaced in the fifth inning because of mid-back tightness. After the game, Votto, wearing a Toronto Raptors T-shirt, said he doesn't think he'll miss any time. Votto was born in Toronto.	Indians: 2B Jason Kipnis missed his second straight game with tightness in his right hip.	UP NEXT	Reds: RHP Tyler Mahle (2-6, 4.21 ERA) starts the opener of a three-game series Friday against Texas. He suffered consecutive tough losses last month, when the Reds batted .070 (4 of 57) while being shut out twice.	Indians: Following an off day, Adam Plutko (2-1, 5.19 ERA) will make his first start on the road as Cleveland begins a three-game series at Detroit on Friday.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

DENVER --  Cole Hamels was sharp all afternoon -- even when his fastball hit Nolan Arenado in the arm.	At least that's what Arenado thinks.	Hamels struck out nine in seven scoreless innings, singled twice and drove in two runs to lead the Chicago Cubs past the Colorado Rockies 10-1 in a testy game on Wednesday.	It was the third straight start Hamels went at least seven innings and didn't allow an earned run, but his performance was overshadowed by tensions between the teams that likely contributed to four batters getting hit by pitches.	Arenado departed in the fifth inning with a left forearm contusion after Hamels (6-2) plunked him in the third, and three more batters -- including Hamels -- were hit by pitches later in the game.	"It kind of got out of hand but I hope Nolan's all right," said Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo, one of the four victims.	Javier Baez and Kyle Schwarber homered for Chicago, which snapped a five-game road losing streak. Colorado's 10-game home winning streak ended.	Arenado looked toward the mound after he was hit by Hamels' pitch, and he said something to the Chicago dugout before walking to first base. He was later forced out at second and played the field in the fourth, throwing out Addison Russell to start the inning. Ryan McMahon replaced him in the top of the fifth.	X-rays on his arm were negative.	"When I first got hit, I knew it was on the meat, where the muscle is, so I was feeling OK," Arenado said. "But it was throbbing and it got super-tight, and sometimes when it gets super-tight quick it can be a break. It was just getting tight and the game was getting ugly so they thought just get me out of there and get me rested and hopefully feel better tomorrow."	He wasn't surprised when Hamels's pitch got him in the forearm. Chicago's Kris Bryant was hit by pitches three times in the first two games of the series, and he missed time last year after getting hit in the head by German Marquez at Coors Field. Marquez also hit two Cubs in his start in Chicago last week.	"We hit Bryant twice yesterday, buzzed Baez's tower there on a 1-1 pitch, so I kind of had a feeling it was going to happen," Arenado said.	Bryant was given the day off, and before the game manager Joe Maddon said it was, in part, because he had been "ball-peened the last couple of days."	But Maddon also said he didn't think Bryant was hit on purpose, and he said Arenado getting plunked was unintentional.	"I'm not going to hit their guys (for) hitting KB. Everybody has the right to pitch inside," he said. "If you're going to pitch successfully in this ballpark you have to pitch inside, and some guys are going to get hit."	Colorado manager Bud Black had his suspicions.	"It didn't look right to me," he said.	Things settled down until Rockies reliever Bryan Shaw hit Hamels in the right foot with a pitch in the seventh inning, and Colorado rookie Phillip Diehl hit Rizzo in the eighth, drawing a warning to both dugouts from home plate umpire Roberto Ortiz.	Hamels said the pitch got him on the ankle but he would be fine for his next start.	"I think he was trying to make pitches inside because I was able to get a couple of hits that were away," he said.	Baez followed with a two-run homer, his 17th, and took extra time to watch it travel 460 feet.	"I'd say he watched that one a little extra," Rizzo said. "When you think something is intentional and you get him back on that it feels a little bit better."	Cubs reliever Brad Brach hit Tony Wolters in the ninth but was not ejected.	Chicago scored five times in the second off Antonio Sentenzela (5-5). Jason Heyward had a two-run single and Schwarber hit three-run homer to the second deck in right-center, his 14th. Sentenzela lasted to the fifth inning, when he gave up three more runs, two on a single by Hamels.	Hamels got out of a bases-loaded jam in the first and breezed from there, allowing six hits. David Dahl had three of Colorado's hits.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: RHP Steve Cishek was carted off the field before the game after getting hit on the inside of his right knee while playing catch with Brandon Kintzler. Cishek said the trainers iced the knee and he feels he should be fine in a day or two.	UP NEXT	Cubs: LHP Jon Lester (5-4, 3.56 ERA) will face Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw in the opener of a four-game series at Los Angeles on Thursday night.	Rockies: RHP Jon Gray (5-5, 4.27) will open a four-game home series against San Diego on Thursday night.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

BOSTON --  Mookie Betts watched patiently as four straight pitches missed the strike zone, and the Red Sox averted disaster.	Betts drew a bases-loaded walk from reliever Jesse Chavez in the ninth, giving the Red Sox a 4-3 win over the Texas Rangers on Wednesday and halting Boston's three-game skid.	"I was pretty confident knowing the situation that he had to kind of come to me at that point. He was in trouble," Betts said. "It's huge. It's kind of tough because obviously we didn't want to let them back in the game right there."	Boston rallied against Chavez (2-1) in the ninth after allowing the Rangers to tie it in the eighth on an unearned run.	Andrew Benintendi hit a triple and two doubles, driving in two runs for the Red Sox as they avoided falling below .500 for the first time in more than a month.	Christian Vazquez, whose throwing error in the eighth put the tying run on third, led off the ninth with a ground-rule double to center. Jackie Bradley Jr. followed with a single and the Rangers walked Michael Chavis to load the bases for Betts, who fouled off the first pitch he saw from Chavez. The next four pitches were balls, and Marco Hernandez, who pinch-ran for Vazquez, trotted home.	"I was just missing by a little bit. I think I was trying to be too fine in that situation where I don't know why I should," said Chavez, whose scoreless streak of 22 2/3 innings came to an end. "Just let them put the ball on the ground and let the defense do the work. Today was a day when I wasn't able to do it in a situation when we needed it, for sure."	The start of the game was moved up three hours to 4:05 p.m. to avoid overlapping with Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final between the Boston Bruins and St. Louis Blues. Chants of "We want the Cup!" rang out from the stands throughout the game.	Matt Barnes (3-1) pitched a scoreless ninth. Starter Rick Porcello was in position for the win until Texas tied it in the eighth.	Brandon Workman hit Shin-Soo Choo with a pitch and went to third when Vazquez fielded a bunt by Delino DeShields and threw wildly. Elvis Andrus tied it with a sacrifice fly to right.	The Rangers had three consecutive hits with two outs in the first, taking a 2-0 lead on Hunter Pence's double to center, then went without a baserunner until the sixth. Porcello retired 13 straight batters before Andrus' two-out double in the sixth.	Porcello allowed two runs on five hits in 6 2/3 innings.	"This was a game I think everybody knew we needed to win," Benintendi said. "Rick went out there and after that first inning, threw the ball really well and gave us a shot to win. Yeah, this is a big win so hopefully we can build off it."	Benintendi, ejected Tuesday night for shouting at umpire Angel Hernandez about a called strike, doubled and scored in the first. He hit an RBI triple in the third, tying it at 2-2, and drove in a run with a double in the fifth.	Starter Lance Lynn worked six innings for the Rangers, allowing three runs on six hits. He walked one and struck out eight.	WINNING	The Red Sox, who only a few days before were trying to climb five games above .500, improved to 35-34. Boston hasn't had a losing record since May 7, when it beat Baltimore to move to 19-19.	The World Series champion Red Sox haven't been more than four games above .500 so far this season.	"I've been saying the goal is to get to five over," manager Alex Cora said. "We need to get there, and I say sooner rather than later and it's getting, like, later. But we've still got time to do that."	TEXAS TOUGH	Rangers manager Chris Woodward had an easy time shaking off this loss. His club has won four of six and has a chance at taking three of four in the Rangers' only visit to Boston this season.	"We're in a good spot. We've been playing well, so it's fun to watch our guys compete in that kind of environment against a good team," Woodward said. "When they take it out on the field, they're fearless. We got beat today, but they had to execute some pitches to beat us and that's going to happen every once in a while."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: LHP Drew Smyly will miss his scheduled start on Friday when Texas visits Cincinnati. Woodward said he wanted to take some pressure off Smyly, who has struggled in his last two starts and will be available in the bullpen. ... LF Willie Calhoun (quadriceps strain) will start a rehab assignment with Triple-A Nashville on Thursday. ... 1B Ronald Guzman needed few minutes after a sharp grounder caught him on the wrist in the second inning.	Red Sox: RHP Hector Velazquez (back) will start a rehab assignment Thursday or Friday, manager Alex Cora said. Velazquez has been on the injured list since May 30 ... LHP Brian Johnson (left elbow inflammation) will travel with the club this weekend for a three-game series at Baltimore. Johnson, on the injured list since April 6, could pitch some relief or possibly start Sunday, Cora said.	UP NEXT	RHP Adrian Sampson (5-3, 3.72 ERA) starts the series finale for the Rangers on Thursday against Boston LHP David Price (4-2. 2.70).	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

BALTIMORE --  The game pitted the two worst teams in the AL East, lasted more than four hours and ended in the rain before a smattering of fans.	After 12 pitchers combined to throw 374 pitches and issue 13 walks on a soggy Wednesday night, the Toronto Blue Jays retreated to the clubhouse at Camden Yards to savor the end of a five-game losing streak.	Rowdy Tellez hit a grand slam to cap a six-run fifth inning and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. had three hits to help Toronto beat the Baltimore Orioles 8-6 Wednesday night.	Lourdes Gurriel Jr. had two RBI for the Blue Jays, who matched their run total from the previous five games combined.	"A lot of times one guy has a good at-bat and the next two guys don't have good at-bats," manager Charlie Montoyo said. "But today, one by one, they had good at-bats. So that helped."	Toronto sent nine batters to the plate in the fifth, scoring on an infield single and a wild pitch before Tellez sent a 2-2 pitch from Miguel Castro over the right-field scoreboard . It was the second grand slam of the season for the rookie, who had gone hitless in his previous 11 at-bats.	Trey Mancini homered for the Orioles, who won the series opener and were trying to put together back-to-back victories for the first time since May 4-6.	Baltimore used a four-run eighth to cut into an 8-2 deficit but could not complete the comeback.	Pitching in his 400th career game, Edwin Jackson (1-4) allowed two runs in five innings of relief for Toronto. The 35-year-old was initially listed as the starter, but Montoyo switched to opener Derek Law so the struggling Jackson could avoid facing the top of the Baltimore batting order at the outset.	Law pitched a scoreless first inning before giving way to Jackson, who came in with an 11.90 ERA over five starts.	Backed by a rare offensive outburst from the Blue Jays, Jackson earned his first win since Sept. 20.	"It's always good when you're having fun and you're scoring a lot of runs," the right-hander said. "It was good for that to happen to the team, just that little reassurance of the things they're capable of doing."	Daniel Hudson quelled Baltimore's uprising in the eighth and earned his first save by getting three straight outs after the Orioles put runners on second and third.	"I thought we did a great job battling back from down 8-2, making it interesting there at the end," manager Brandon Hyde said. "Unfortunately, Hudson kind of turned it up there. We just didn't get it done."	Baltimore starter David Hess (1-9) gave up four runs, five hits and four walks in four-plus innings. He's winless in 12 starts since beating Toronto on April 1.	"The walks were really killer tonight, and especially in that fifth inning that created a big inning," Hess said. "That's something that needs to be limited."	The game drew 11,153 fans, many of whom departed after it started to rain in the seventh.	HOME AND AWAY	Baltimore's major league-worst home record fell to 9-24. Toronto ended a seven-game road skid and improved the AL's second-worst road record to 12-21.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: Toronto closer Ken Giles (1-1, 1.08 ERA, 11 saves) was placed on the 10-day injured list, retroactive to June 9, with elbow inflammation. Montoyo expects the right-hander's stint on the IL to be a short one.	Orioles: Hyde said the decision to shut down RHP Alex Cobb for season-ending hip surgery did not come abruptly. "I knew it was a possibility. Obviously we want what's best for Alex, and we want Alex healthy," said Hyde, who expects Cobb to be ready for spring training.	OH, CANADA	The Blue Jays filled Giles' roster spot by purchasing the contract of right-handed reliever Jordan Romano from Triple-A Buffalo. Romano pitched a scoreless seventh inning to become the 28th Canadian-born player in Blue Jays history and 13th to make his major league debut with Toronto.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays: Marcus Stroman (3-8, 3.31 ERA) makes his 15th start of the season in the series finale. He is 4-5 lifetime vs. Baltimore.	Orioles: Gabriel Ynoa (0-2, 4.96) resumes his quest to earn his first win since Sept. 21, 2017. The right-hander has never faced Toronto.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

MIAMI --  Miami Marlins pitcher Jordan Yamamoto had just dropped down a successful suicide squeeze bunt and was on his way back to the dugout when he stopped at the plate to pick up his bat and return it to the rack, beating the batboy to the task.	What a rookie.	Yamamoto did it all Wednesday, earning an RBI and pitching seven innings to win his major league debut, and the Marlins broke a six-game losing streak by beating the St. Louis Cardinals 9-0.	Garrett Cooper hit a grand slam and finished a double shy of the cycle. That was more than enough support for Yamamoto, acquired last year in the Christian Yelich trade.	The 23-year-old Hawaiian right-hander limited St. Louis to three hits and two walks.	"At first I was really nervous," Yamamoto said. "I've been sweating all day. But once I got the first guy out, I kind of calmed down."	Yamamoto topped out at only 93 mph but changed speeds and threw strikes.	"He's a fun guy to watch," manager Don Mattingly said. "I'm sure if he goes to a tryout, the scouts are looking at this guy and you're probably not signing him. But he can add and subtract. He'll throw his fastball at 86, and at 92. He just mixes and mixes. He's unpredictable."	Two relievers completed a three-hitter.	Yamamoto was recalled from Double-A Jacksonville to fill in for Jose Urena, who went on the 10-day injured list with a strained lower back. After he received word Tuesday of his promotion to the majors, his parents and sister scrambled to make it to the game from Hawaii.	"I called them and was like, `Hey, get on a flight," he said. "They were like, `It's too expensive.' I said, `Mom, I don't care. It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing. Get out here."	Yamamoto enjoyed an early cushion thanks to Cooper, who pulled a two-out inside fastball that was off the plate for a grand slam in the second inning against Miles Mikolas (4-7).	Cooper also tripled and scored in the first inning, and singled in the fifth. He struck out in the seventh and eighth.	"I'm not going to lie, I was looking for that double," he said with a chuckle. "I swung a little too hard the last couple of times."	Yamamoto's bunt in the sixth made it 6-0, and Curtis Granderson hit a three-run homer in the eighth. The laugher was quite a change for the Marlins, who totaled 10 runs during their losing streak.	The Cardinals had several hard-hit outs against Yamamoto. Their best threat came with runners at the corners and none out in the fourth, when the rookie right-hander escaped with a foulout by Marcell Ozuna and a double play grounder by Yadier Molina.	But Yamamoto struck out five and was consistently ahead in the count. He needed only 95 pitches.	"Congratulations to Jordan," said Cardinals second baseman Kolten Wong, another Hawaiian. "I'm really proud of him. He kept his composure all night."	When Yamamoto notched his first strikeout, the stadium PA system played the theme from "Hawaii Five-0." He wore jersey No. 50.	He was acquired in January 2018, and Yelich went on to win the National League Most Valuable Player award for the Milwaukee Brewers.	CHANGE IN FORTUNE	Mikolas gave up five runs in five innings and lost his fifth decision in a row. He went 18-4 last season.	"I'm not getting away with as many mistakes as I did last year," he said. "I got a little lucky last year. I don't think I'm lucky at all this year."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: RHP Ryan Helsley (shoulder impingement) faced two batters in the sixth and then left the game. He'll go on the injured list, manager Mike Shildt said. ... Barring a setback, INF Jedd Gyorko (strained lower back) is expected to be activated Tuesday, when he's eligible to come off the 10-day injured list.	Marlins: Injury-plagued 3B Martin Prado (tight right hamstring) will go on the injured list, Mattingly said. Prado pulled up while running out a groundout in the third and left the game. ... Urena went on the IL retroactive to Sunday.	UP NEXT	Cardinals: RHP Jack Flaherty (4-3, 4.08) is scheduled to start Thursday to begin a four-game series at the New York Mets. RHP Daniel Ponce de Leon (0-0, 1.80) is scheduled to make his second start of the season Friday as a replacement for the injured Adam Wainwright.	Marlins: Following a day off, RHP Trevor Richards (3-6, 3.31) is scheduled to start Friday to begin a three-game series at home against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Richards is 3-1 with a 1.09 ERA in his past four starts.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	---	Follow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve-Wine.

ATLANTA --  Austin Riley knew he had a good chance to score from first base as soon as Ozzie Albies made contact.	The power-hitting left fielder just didn't know whether he'd get the green light from third base coach Ron Washington.	"I knew it was in the gap, so run as hard as I can," Riley said. "If he wants to stop me, he'll stop me. He didn't stop me. A good hit by Ozzie and a good team win."	Riley tied the game with a solo homer in the ninth inning and scored the winning run on Albies' double off Michael Feliz in the 11th, leading the Atlanta Braves past the Pittsburgh Pirates 8-7 for their sixth straight victory Wednesday night.	The Braves (39-29) took over sole possession of first place in the NL East and moved 10 games over .500 for the first time this season.	Josh Bell hit a tiebreaking solo homer off Atlanta closer Luke Jackson in the top of the ninth. Riley, who had a two-run triple in the first, took Kyle Crick deep to make it 7-all in the bottom half.	After Riley was hit by a pitch on his left hand in the 11th, Albies drove a gapper into right-center and Riley slid headfirst across the plate to end it.	"As soon as I hit it in the gap," Albies said, "I knew he would score and win this game."	Jacob Webb (4-0) pitched two innings to earn the victory.	Feliz (2-3) took the loss.	Rain delayed the game for 55 minutes in the seventh.	Braves starter Mike Soroka allowed career highs of five runs and 10 hits in five innings. The 21-year-old began the night having given up one run or less in nine of 10 starts this season, but did not factor in the decision. Soroka, whose ERA rose 54 points to 1.92, walked one and struck out three.	Atlanta led 3-0 in the first on Nick Markakis' opposite-field RBI single and Riley's triple. The Braves were up 4-2 in the second after Freddie Freeman's RBI single and 6-2 in the third following Soroka's two-run single.	Pittsburgh made it 3-2 in the second on RBI singles by Adam Frazier and Elias Diaz and 6-4 in the fourth on Kevin Newman's two-run double. Starling Marte's 10th homer cut the margin to 6-5 in the fifth.	The Pirates tied it 6-all in the sixth against Josh Tomlin. Gregory Polanco had a pinch-hit single, advanced to third on Newman's single and scored on Corey Dickerson's sacrifice fly.	"We had our backs against the wall a little bit, but we battled back and gave ourselves a chance," said Bell, who leads the majors with 61 RBI. "It's good mojo going into tomorrow."	Mitch Keller, making his second career start for Pittsburgh, allowed six runs and 10 hits in three innings. His ERA rose 1.93 points to 15.43.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: Director of sports medicine Tom Tomcyzk said C Francisco Cervelli, on the injured list since May 26 with a concussion, has no symptoms and is scheduled to be re-examined by a neurologist in the next couple of days. Tomcyzk said Cervelli feels normal in everyday life, but has yet to be cleared. The 33-year-old Cervelli has a long history with head injuries during his 12-year career, including six documented concussions since 2011.	Braves: CF Ender Inciarte, on the injured list since May 15 with a lumbar strain, still has no timetable to resume baseball activities. "It's still biting him a bit. I think he has good days, has bad days, taking it a day at a time," manager Brian Snitker said. "He's not in that position now to even look ahead where he might -- until he starts running the bases, hitting and all that stuff."	SHARP PLAY	Braves shortstop Dansby Swanson saved a run in the third. Running into left field, he bumped into third baseman Josh Donaldson a bit as both players pursued the shallow fly. Swanson called off Donaldson and Riley to turn and make a difficult basket catch.	MORE RILEY	The rookie slugger became the fastest player in franchise history to reach 10 homers, doing so in 26 games to break the mark set by Wally Berger of the Boston Braves in 1930. Riley also tied Earl Torgeson of the 1947 Boston Braves as the quickest to 29 RBI, in 26 games. ... Riley had his left hand wrapped in ice after the game. He said he was sore from getting hit by the pitch, but not in pain.	LANGELIERS SIGNS	The Braves signed their first-round draft pick, Baylor catcher Shea Langeliers. Atlanta chose Langeliers with the ninth overall selection, which it received as compensation for not signing last year's No. 8 pick, pitcher Carter Stewart.	UP NEXT	Pirates: RHP Joe Musgrove (4-6, 4.40 ERA) starts for the second time in the four-game series after getting ejected in the first inning Monday following a confrontation with Donaldson.	Braves: RHP Julio Teheran (4-3, 3.03) is 2-0 with a 0.70 ERA in his last seven starts.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  After loading the bases with nobody out in the eighth inning, the Detroit Tigers mustered only one run.	That was all they needed.	Brandon Dixon hit a tiebreaking sacrifice fly off reliever Jake Diekman that sent Detroit past the Kansas City Royals 3-2 on Wednesday night.	"The guy was throwing the ball pretty hard with a great breaking ball," Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire said. "(Dixon) stayed behind it, stayed on it and drove it the other way to get the run home. That's huge."	Miguel Cabrera also had a sacrifice fly for the Tigers, and Ronny Rodriguez hit an RBI double.	Jorge Soler drove in both Royals runs but flied out with a runner on to end the game.	"He had two big two-out RBI today to keep us in the game," Kansas City manager Ned Yost said, "and he just missed that last ball. Really picked us up big-time. He was a majority of our offense. Anytime you get two-out RBI, those are big, and Jorgie got two of them for us."	The teams now head to Omaha, Nebraska, to play the first Major League Baseball game in that state Thursday night. It's a prelude to the College World Series, which begins Saturday in the same ballpark -- also home of Kansas City's Triple-A affiliate.	The Royals need a victory to win a series for the first time since April 12-14.	"You just try to find ways to score some runs to make those good starts count for something," Yost said. "Danny (Duffy) was really, really good."	After the start was delayed 24 minutes because of the threat of rain, Diekman (0-3) walked JaCoby Jones leading off the eighth. Christin Stewart doubled under the glove of first baseman Ryan O'Hearn, sending Jones to third.	After walking Nicholas Castellanos, Diekman struck out Cabrera. But then Dixon sent right fielder Terrance Gore to the fence for the go-ahead sacrifice fly.	"Got myself in trouble, couldn't get out of it," Diekman said.	When asked if he felt good about only allowing the one run, he added: "No, because I still gave up the lead with the run. Hung a slider and he hit it to right field. If it was a decent slider it could have been different, but it was a terrible pitch."	Nick Ramirez (3-0) pitched two scoreless innings to earn the win. Shane Greene worked the ninth for his 20th save in 21 chances.	"We hung in there," Gardenhire said. "Ramirez came in and did a really nice job for a couple of innings."	Neither starter factored in the decision.	Duffy had a solid outing for the Royals. After walking his first two batters, he buckled down and completed seven innings, allowing two runs and four hits. He walked only those two batters and struck out six.	Tigers left-hander Daniel Norris gave up two runs and six hits in five innings with two walks and six strikeouts.	Cabrera drove in Jones with a sac fly in the first inning as Detroit scored without the benefit of a hit.	After wasting a couple of scoring chances in the first two innings, the Royals finally got a run in the third. Whit Merrifield stroked a leadoff double to the wall in left-center. He stole third and scored on Soler's double.	Detroit came right back in the fourth when John Hicks and Rodriguez hit back-to-back doubles.	Soler's two-out single knocked in Alex Gordon in the fifth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: SS Niko Goodrum was out of the lineup after fouling a ball off his kneecap Tuesday. "He's sore. There was some swelling. He's moving around. We'll talk to him and see how he feels and go on from there," Gardenhire said. ... INF Jeimer Candelario was set to begin his rehab assignment at Triple-A Toledo. He's been on the 10-day injured list since June 4 (retroactive to June 2) with left shoulder inflammation. ... RHP Jordan Zimmermann will pitch Thursday for Toledo on his rehab assignment.	Royals: 3B Hunter Dozier took grounders and some swings off a tee. Kansas City manager Ned Yost said Dozier was expected to take more swings in the cage Thursday. If everything goes well, he'll take batting practice on the field and likely head out on a rehab assignment.	UP NEXT	LHP Matthew Boyd (5-4, 3.08 ERA) starts Thursday night for Detroit against RHP Homer Bailey (4-6, 5.90). Boyd's last appearance at TD Ameritrade Park in Omaha was in 2013, when he pitched a four-hit shutout to help Oregon State beat Indiana 1-0 in a College World Series elimination game.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

HOUSTON -- On a night when the Milwaukee Brewers struck out again and again, piling up a season-high 24 K's against the Houston Astros, one big swing by Mike Moustakas made all those whiffs way easier to swallow.	Moustakas hit a two-run homer during Milwaukee's three-run 14th inning, and the Brewers struck out 15 times against Houston ace Justin Verlander before rallying for a 6-3 victory over the Astros on Wednesday.	Christian Yelich started the 14th with a single against rookie Cionel Perez (1-1) for Milwaukee's first hit since the ninth. After Ryan Braun lined out, Moustakas hit a drive to right for his 21st homer.	"Obviously, 24 punchouts isn't what we were looking for, but ... we got a W so we turned a negative into a positive and found a way to win against a great ballclub over there," Moustakas said.	Jesus Aguilar added a pinch-hit RBI single as Milwaukee won for the fifth time in six games. Braun, Yasmani Grandal and Eric Thames also went deep for the Brewers, and Adrian Houser (2-1) pitched two scoreless innings for the victory. "I bet you there's not too many times a team struck out 24 times and won the game," Yelich said. "All those weird baseball things happen and that's another example of it. Honestly, it's just a really good win and a hard-fought win."	Verlander set a career high for K's while allowing three runs in seven innings. The 2011 American League Cy Young Award winner led the way as Houston set a franchise record for strikeouts, surpassing its previous record of 23 during a 15-inning game on May 31, 2003, against the Chicago Cubs.	Verlander joined Randy Johnson as the only pitchers in Astros history with at least 15 strikeouts and no walks in a game, according to ESPN Stats & Information research. (Johnson had 16 strikeouts against the Pittsburgh Pirates on August 28, 1998.)	"It would feel a lot better if we won," Verlander said. "Yeah, cool, great, but we didn't win the baseball game."	Houston had a 3-2 lead before Thames connected in the seventh inning for Milwaukee's third homer off Verlander. It was Thames' ninth of the season.	Each team had late chances to go in front.	Jake Marisnick singled off Houser with one out in the 13th. Marisnick stole second base, but Houser retired Josh Reddick and Alex Bregman to end the threat.	Pinch hitter Myles Straw walked leading off the Houston 10th, but was caught trying to steal second base. He was initially called safe, but the Brewers challenged the call and it was overturned. Josh Hader walked Tyler White, but Marisnick grounded into a double play to end the inning.	"Hitting is hard. They threw some pretty good arms at us," Astros manager AJ Hinch said. "They're a good team, and yes, it doesn't feel good when you go quietly like that."	Singles by Yelich and Moustakas left runners at first and third with one out in the ninth. But Roberto Osuna struck out Grandal and Thames to escape the jam.	Verlander surrendered solo drives to Braun in the first and Grandal in the second before settling into a groove. He retired 17 of 18 after Grandal's 15th homer, with Milwaukee's only baserunner coming on a double by Thames to start the fifth.	Verlander, who had fanned 14 four times in his career, struck out eight of his final 10 batters, including the side in the sixth.	Milwaukee's Brandon Woodruff also yielded three runs and four hits in seven innings.	The Brewers led 2-0 before the Astros scored three times in the fourth. Robinson Chirinos singled in Yuli Gurriel before Tony Kemp doubled in two runs.	ANNIVERSARY	Verlander got the start on the 12th anniversary of his first career no-hitter, a 4-0 victory over Milwaukee. Brewers manager Craig Counsell led off in that one and finished 0-for-4 with two strikeouts.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: RHP Jhoulys Chacin (lower back strain) will come off the injured list to start against San Diego on Monday.	Astros: 2B Jose Altuve (leg fatigue) and OF George Springer (hamstring) are both improving, and Hinch said they could start rehabilitation assignments sometime this weekend. ... C Max Stassi (knee soreness) is scheduled to begin a rehabilitation assignment Thursday.	DYNAMIC DUO	Yelich and Moustakas each had two hits. Yelich extended his hitting streak to 10 games, which is the longest streak for the Brewers this season, and Moustakas has hit safely in 10 of the past 11 games.	UP NEXT	Brewers: Milwaukee is off Thursday before Zach Davies (7-0, 2.41 ERA) starts Friday night in the opener of a three-game series at San Francisco. Davies allowed three runs in five innings in a 5-3 win over Pittsburgh in his most recent start.	Astros: Following an off day, Houston hosts Toronto on Friday in the first of three games. Gerrit Cole (5-5, 3.72 ERA) is scheduled to start. Cole yielded three runs -- one earned -- and struck out a season-high 14 in seven innings but did not factor in the decision in a 4-3 win over the Orioles in his previous start.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Seattle got another chance in the 10th inning, and Dee Gordon ran his way to the win for the Mariners.	Gordon scored on one of Minnesota's five errors, helping the Mariners beat the Twins 9-6 on Wednesday night.	Seattle went 1 for 17 with runners in scoring position and left 11 on base.	"We didn't take advantage of some scoring opportunities early in the game," manager Scott Servais said. "Often times that'll come back and bite you."	Not this time around. Not with Minnesota struggled defensively.	Gordon opened the 10th with a ground-rule double off Tyler Duffey (1-1). Shed Long then walked before the runners advanced on Dylan Moore's sacrifice.	Mallex Smith followed with a grounder to first baseman C.J. Cron, who tried to get the speedy Gordon at the plate. Mitch Garver picked up the error when he was unable to handle the throw.	"I knew who the runner was, so I knew I didn't have much time, and I just missed it," Garver said.	After Kyle Seager struck out, Long and Smith scored when third baseman Miguel Sano flubbed Edwin Encarnacion's grounder. The AL Central-leading Twins committed three errors in the final inning.	"I think it's just one of those nights where a few things happen, a few funny hops, a few plays maybe breaking the wrong way off the bat," Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said.	Seattle carried a 6-4 lead into the ninth, but Byron Buxton hit a tying two-run shot off Anthony Bass (1-1) with no outs. Roenis Elias worked a perfect 10th for his sixth save.	It was a frantic finish after pitching controlled most of the action.	Gerson Bautista worked 1 1/3 scoreless innings for Seattle in an opener role. Then Tommy Milone came in and pitched six innings of three-run ball against his former team.	Daniel Vogelback hit his 17th homer for the Mariners in the sixth inning, but Marwin Gonzalez tied it at 1 with his eighth homer in the seventh.	Twins right-hander Jose Berrios allowed seven hits in 6 2/3 innings. He struck out six and walked two.	Seattle scored five times in the eighth to open a 6-1 lead. Long had the big blow, hitting a three-run shot to right for his first career homer.	"It was a blessing," said Long, who plans to give the ball from the drive to his dad for Father's Day on Sunday.	Minnesota responded with three in the bottom half.  Max Kepler launched his 16th homer, and Mitch Garver and Gonzalez had run-scoring singles.	STREAKING	Minnesota's Jorge Polanco extended his hitting streak to 13 games with a single in the eighth inning. It also extended his on-base streak to 26 games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: Servais said infielder J.P. Crawford, who has missed the last two weeks with a sprained left ankle, should rejoin the team in Oakland on Friday. Crawford hit a three-run homer Tuesday during his rehab assignment with High-A Modesto, and Servais said Crawford "felt good."	UP NEXT	Mariners: Rookie LHP Yusei Kikuchi has lasted just 3 1/3 innings in each of his last three outings. He'll look to snap his three-game losing streak in the series finale.	Twins: RHP Michael Pineda has allowed three earned runs in each of his last six starts. He'll try to beat the Mariners for the second time this season, having previously earned a win on May 16 in Seattle.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Will Smith had to work around a pair of two-out hits and a seven-pitch walk in the ninth inning to keep his perfect season intact with another save.	Make it 16 for 16 for the Giants closer, who got Manuel Margot to pop up with the bases loaded for the final out of San Francisco's 4-2 win over the San Diego Padres on Wednesday night.	"It got a little scary there in the ninth," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "But Smitty made a pitch when he had to."	Smith has been doing that all season, although his save opportunities have been limited by San Francisco's struggles. The left-hander was in position for one Wednesday and quickly retired the first two batters in the ninth before running into trouble.	Ian Kinsler reached on an infield single that was initially ruled an error. Pinch-hitter Hunter Renfroe followed with a double and Smith walked pinch-hitter Wil Myers before retiring Margot to end it.	"I knew the offense had given us a two-run lead so if that guy on third scored, so what?" Smith said. "I wasn't really panicking. I was more worried about Renfroe than anything else. So when he hit that double, so what, who cares? Let's just try to get one more out."	Smith's 16 consecutive saves to start the season are the second-most for the Giants since saves became an official stat in 1969.	"Our bullpen is unbelievable," winning pitcher Shaun Anderson said. "The trust is awesome to have that back there."	Evan Longoria drove in the go-ahead run with an infield single in the fifth after the Padres made two errors.	Kevin Pillar homered for the first time in more than a month and Donovan Solano had two hits and two RBI for the Giants. Buster Posey went 1 for 4 after coming off the injured list earlier in the day.	Anderson (2-1) pitched four-hit ball over six innings and had a season-high six strikeouts for San Francisco. The rookie has a 3.32 ERA in three June starts after going 0-1 with a 4.80 ERA in three May starts.	Eric Hosmer had an RBI double for the Padres, who committed three errors overall that led to three runs.	"Ninth inning, we put ourselves in a position to win," manager Andy Green said. "It just wasn't enough to get over the hump."	San Diego's defense came apart in the fifth.	Steven Duggar singled, went to second on a wild throw by shortstop Fernando Tatis Jr. and scored on Solano's single. As Solano rounded first, left fielder Josh Naylor made a wild throw toward second that sailed out of play for a two-base error. After Brandon Belt walked, Tatis made a diving stop on Longoria's sharp grounder but threw wide of second as Solano scored.	"I guess we did a little ground attack there and got some breaks," Bochy said. "It happened to us the night before. It was good to take advantage of it."	The Giants added another unearned run in the seventh following a throwing error by Padres reliever Robbie Erlin.	Sam Dyson and Tony Watson retired three batters apiece for San Francisco.	Padres starter Joey Lucchesi (5-4) allowed three runs, two earned, and five hits in six innings. Lucchesi, who beat the Giants on March 29, had six strikeouts and two walks.	A LITTLE SHORT	The Padres thought they had a home run in the first inning when Naylor hit a ball that bounced off the top of the fence in center and back onto the field. A crew chief review confirmed the call of a double. San Diego loaded the bases later in the inning but Anderson got Padres home run leader Franmil Reyes to ground into a 6-4-3 double play on the first pitch.	ROSTER MOVES	San Francisco optioned backup catcher Aramis Garcia to Triple-A Sacramento. San Diego optioned RHP Chris Paddack to Class A Lake Elsinore and called up RHP Robert Stock from Triple-A El Paso.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Giants: Posey missed eight games with a right hamstring injury sustained June 1 in Baltimore. ... Belt returned to the lineup after being limited to a pinch-hitting appearance Tuesday because of a sore neck.	UP NEXT	Padres: LHP Matt Strahm (2-5, 4.03 ERA) is expected to come off the injured list to start against the Rockies in the opener of a four-game series Thursday at Colorado. Strahm has been out with a left rib strain.	Giants: LHP Drew Pomeranz (1-6, 7.16 ERA) tries to get his rocky season back on course Friday against Milwaukee. Pomeranz is winless in his last five starts and has the seventh-highest ERA among pitchers with at least 40 innings.	---	More AP MLB:https://apnews.com/tag/MLB andhttps://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ATLANTA --  One year after he was left off Atlanta's postseason rotation, Julio Teheran has re-emerged as a reliable leader on a young staff.	Teheran's roll of superb starts is a big reason the Braves are back in first place in the NL East.	Josh Donaldson drove in the tie-breaking run in Atlanta's five-run fifth inning to win his rematch with Joe Musgrove, Teheran allowed only one earned run and the Braves beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 6-5 on Thursday to complete a four-game sweep.	The Braves have won seven straight to move into the division lead, 1 1/2 games ahead of idle Philadelphia. The Phillies and Braves open a three-game series on Friday night.	Teheran (5-4) opened the game with two walks and needed 27 pitches to survive the first inning. He recovered, lasting six innings while giving up only three hits. He has allowed no more than one earned run in his last eight starts.	Manager Brian Snitker said he saw Teheran's renewed resolve in spring training.	"It was very evident to me that he was on a mission," Snitker said.	Teheran lowered his ERA to 2.92, a full run lower than last season's 3.94 mark, when he finished 9-9 and was in the bullpen for the NL division series loss to the Dodgers. He is on pace to challenge his career-best ERA of 2.89 in 2014, when he won 14 games.	"That's the way I want to pitch," Teheran said. "Last year, it doesn't mean I was bad, but it was up and down."	Luke Jackson gave up Starling Marte's run-scoring single in the ninth before recovering for his 10th save in 15 chances.	The Pirates have lost seven straight after failing to hold an early 2-1 lead in this one.	Musgrove (4-7) struck out Donaldson in the first inning. It was their first meeting since Musgrove hit Donaldson with a pitch on Monday night, igniting a confrontation that led to both players' ejections. The short outing gave Musgrove the rare opportunity of making two starts in the same series.	"I was ready to go out and attack him like I normally would," Musgrove said. "I put that behind me. I can't go out there with that stuff lingering in the back of my mind or try to prove a point with him."	Musgrove hit Dansby Swanson with a first-inning pitch, but there was no sign of leftover bad feelings from the skirmish three days earlier.	Freddie Freeman's triple to the right-field corner in the fifth drove in Swanson to tie the game. Donaldson, who is appealing his one-game suspension for his role in the confrontation, hit a single to right to drive in Freeman.	Ozzie Albies added a two-run double to center field in the big inning.	The Braves' poor outfield defense helped Pittsburgh take the lead in the fourth. Left fielder Matt Joyce lost Colin Moran's fly ball in the sun, missing his late lunge for the ball as Moran moved to second on the error. Moran scored when Elias Diaz doubled past a diving Ronald Acuna Jr. in center field.	Musgrove faced five batters in the fifth without recording an out. He allowed six runs on nine hits and two walks.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: RHP Trevor Williams (right side strain) was to make a rehab start for Triple-A Indianapolis on Thursday night. He could return to Pittsburgh's rotation next week. ... RHP Chris Stratton (right side discomfort) allowed one run in two innings in his first rehab game with Indianapolis on Tuesday night. ... RHP Jordan Lyles (right side discomfort) is expected to throw in the bullpen this weekend.	Braves: OF Austin Riley did not start but was used as a pinch-hitter after he was hit by a pitch on his left hand and wrist on Wednesday night. Riley's pinch-hit groundout ended the seventh.	NO QUIT	Manager Clint Hurdle says his players haven't quit. After trailing 6-2, Pittsburgh scored the last three runs of the game. "We had the go-ahead run at the plate," Hurdle said, referring to the ninth-inning opportunity. "I love the fight."	TOSSED	Snitker was ejected by home plate umpire Tripp Gibson after Gibson's called strike three on Acuna ended the fourth inning with runners on first and second. Snitker's objection to the high strike call led to his second ejection this season and 11th of his career.	UP NEXT	Pirates: LHP Steven Brault (2-1, 5.05) will make his sixth start of the season on Friday night at Miami against RHP Trevor Richards (3-6, 3.31 ERA).	Braves: LHP Max Fried (7-3, 3.75) will face Philadelphia RHP Nick Pivetta (4-2, 4.93) in the opening game of a weekend series between the NL East leaders on Friday night.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Nelson Cruz and C.J. Cron supplied the power for the team that leads the majors in home runs.	But utility infielder Ehire Adrianza supplied the hustle and the spark in the decisive six-run sixth as the Minnesota Twins topped the Seattle Mariners 10-5 on Thursday.	Cruz, who played for the Mariners from 2015-18 before signing with the Twins as a free agent, had three RBI on a solo homer and a two-run single, the latter in the big sixth inning. Cruz and Adrianza each had three hits, with Adrianza keying the big rally, delivering a hit-and-run single and eventually dashing home on a ground ball against a drawn-in infield.	"Adrianza did a really nice job that whole inning all the way around," Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said.	Max Kepler led off the sixth with a walk before Adrianza, with Kepler running, singled him to third. Mariners right-hander Brandon Brennan, on in relief, threw wildly past first trying to pick off Adrianza. Kepler scored and Adrianza took second on the throwing error.	Adrianza advanced on Brennan's wild pitch and scored on a ground ball by Jason Castro with the infield in, sliding headfirst to beat second baseman Dee Gordon's throw.	"In that situation, you have to be ready," said Adrianza, who bunted for a hit in the second and has reached base in 17 consecutive games, a career high. "When I got to third, Tony (third base coach Tony Diaz) told me, you're going on contact. I was trying to get a pretty good lead and read the swing. I thought I did a pretty good job with it."	Four more runs followed as the Twins batted around, Cruz and Kepler each drove in two with singles. Four of the six runs in the inning were charged to Brennan (2-6), who faced seven batters in the three-game series without retiring any of them. Brennan said he has been pitching through mid-back fatigue that affected his command.	"He's not feeling great," said Seattle manager Scott Servais. "He was good to go today. Coming out of the game, he was a little bit frustrated. He's getting looked at to see where he's at going forward. I hope he is. He just hasn't been sharp probably the last three, four times out."	Seattle lost for the 24th time in 33 games and is 16-41 since its 13-2 start.	Cruz gave the Twins a 1-0 lead in the third with his fifth home run in seven games, a line drive into the lower seats in left. That was the only run allowed in five innings by Mariners starter Yusei Kikuchi, a Japanese left-hander who lost his previous three starts.	"We know we can hit homers, but that's not the only way we can score runs," Cruz said. "Today was a hit-and-run and score from third with the infield in. It's a real exciting team to be a part of."	Twins starter Michael Pineda, facing the team that signed him out of the Dominican Republic in 2005, limited Seattle to two hits in 5 2/3 innings and left the game with two on and a 1-0 lead.	Seattle's Daniel Vogelbach, coming off a career-high four-hit game on Wednesday, singled against Twins reliever Ryne Harper to tie it, the run charged to Pineda.	Harper (2-0), a 30-year-old rookie who pitched into the seventh, was the beneficiary of the Twins' rally.	Cron hit his 15th homer in the seventh for the Twins, who lead the majors with 132. Jorge Polanco's single in the sixth-inning rally gave him a career-high 14-game hitting streak, the longest active streak in the majors.	Seattle's Mallex Smith extended his hitting streak to a career-high-tying 12 games with a single in the eighth, when the Mariners scored twice. The Mariners added two more runs in the ninth.	ROSTER MOVE	Before the game, the Twins recalled right-handed reliever Francisco Romero from Triple-A Rochester and optioned Ryan Eades to the same club. Eades threw 35 pitches over 1 2/3 innings in Wednesday night's 10-inning loss.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Twins: Reliever Taylor Rogers (stiff back) did not pitch for the third consecutive game but warmed up in the ninth.	UP NEXT	Mariners: Marco Gonzalez (6-6, 4.77 ERA), who ended a six-game losing streak by winning his previous start in Anaheim, draws the start Friday as the M's road trip continues with three games in Oakland.	Twins: Kyle Gibson (6-3, 4.14 ERA) starts the opener of a three-game series with Kansas City. In his previous start, he gave up five runs in a loss at Detroit.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

BALTIMORE --  For much of this season, Marcus Stroman has pitched for the Toronto Blue Jays without receiving adequate run support.	His teammates made up for that shortcoming in a big way against the Baltimore Orioles.	Lourdes Gurriel Jr. homered to spark a seven-run sixth inning, Cavan Biggio went deep twice and the Blue Jays rolled to a 12-3 victory Thursday night.	Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Danny Jansen had three hits and two RBI apiece for the Blue Jays, who rediscovered their offense against the woeful Orioles. After scoring eight runs during a five-game skid, Toronto tallied 20 in the final two games of the series.	"Everyone swung the bat well the last two days," manager Charlie Montoyo said, "and that's awesome to see."	In this one, the Blue Jays reached a season high in runs and hits (17).	It was a sight to behold for Stroman, who had received nary a run of support in half of his previous 14 starts. His total backing was 2.87 runs per nine innings, lowest in the big leagues.	"I've been talking about it all year, kind of saying our guys were going to turn it around at some point," the right-hander said. "It's a long year and we're starting to swing the bats better. A lot of young guys are beginning to get settled in."	Stroman (4-8) allowed two runs, one earned, over six innings and left with a seven-run lead.	"I think we can do pretty special things with this lineup," he insisted. "Some of these young guys can really hit, and I think they are only going to get better."	Playing in his 15th major league game, Biggio hit solo shots in the second and seventh. He came in batting .146 with one home run and three RBI.	Toronto used seven hits and two walks in the sixth to turn a 2-all game into a blowout. Gurriel started the onslaught with a drive to center off Gabriel Ynoa (0-3), and Freddy Galvis and Jansen added two-run singles before Guerrero and Justin Smoak capped the Blue Jays' biggest inning of the year with RBI singles.	This is the 14th successive series that Baltimore has failed to win (0-13-1) since taking two of three against the White Sox from April 22-24.	"Rubber game of the series, we were right there in the top of the sixth and then it got away from us," manager Brandon Hyde said.	Chance Sisco homered and Anthony Santander hit a pair of RBI singles for the rebuilding Orioles, whose minus-133 run differential is the worst in the majors.	"Everybody's clearly frustrated, but we know the position we're in," first baseman Chris Davis said. "We have to focus on the positives. There are things that we're trying to accomplish that are going to take time, they're going to take work."	ORIOLES' TOP PICK HONORED	Drafted this month by Baltimore with the No. 1 overall pick, Oregon State catcher Adley Rutschman was named winner of the 42nd annual Golden Spikes Award on Thursday. The award is given to the top amateur baseball player in the United States based on their athletic ability, sportsmanship, character and overall contribution to the sport.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: Relief pitcher Elvis Luciano (1-0, 6.51 ERA) was placed on the 10-day injured list with right elbow inflammation. RHP Justin Shafer was recalled from Triple-A Buffalo.	Orioles: Mark Trumbo interrupted his rehab assignment to receive a platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection in his sore right knee. He will be out 7-10 days, and "hopefully back on track after that," Hyde said. Trumbo has been on the injured list the entire season following knee surgery in September. ... OF Dwight Smith Jr. (concussion list) could be back this weekend, Hyde said. ... OF DJ Stewart (right ankle sprain) will probably go on a rehab assignment if his time on the IL goes past Sunday, according to Hyde.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays: Aaron Sanchez (3-7, 4.25 ERA) tries to end a run of six straight losses when Toronto opens a three-game series at Houston on Friday night.	Orioles: The World Series champion Boston Red Sox come to Camden Yards for a three-game series beginning Friday. Baltimore's scheduled starter, Andrew Cashner, was scratched with a blister on his pitching hand. Hyde said the team would likely delve into the minor league system for a substitute starter.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

WASHINGTON --  Zack Greinke doesn't think much about no-hitters.	He was in the minority Thursday night when he took a bid into the seventh inning as the Arizona Diamondbacks cruised to a 5-0 victory over the Washington Nationals.	Greinke (8-2) tossed 7 1/3 innings, leaving after a 63-minute rain delay. The right-hander struck out three without a walk.	"It wasn't meant to be," Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said. "Either way you look at it. We were going to shut him down through that rain delay. But it was really fun to watch while it was going on."	Alex Avila and Jarrod Dyson homered for Arizona, which has won seven of eight.	Greinke had faced the minimum when Trea Turner led off the seventh with a grounder between first and second. First baseman Christian Walker made a diving stop but was unable to get off a throw against the speedy Turner, who legged out an infield single.	"I thought it was going to be tough to get there in time anyway," Greinke said. "Tough throw even if he did throw with how fast Turner is."	Adam Eaton followed with a single but Anthony Rendon grounded into a double play and Juan Soto grounded out.	Greinke retired the first 10 Nationals before hitting Eaton in the foot with a pitch. Rendon followed with a liner back to Greinke, who doubled Eaton off first.	"He's locked in," Lovullo said of Greinke, who has 13 1/3 scoreless innings in his past two starts. "This is my third year with him and when he gets on these rolls you just sit back and get out of the way."	The 35-year-old ace has never thrown a no-hitter in the majors. He took one into the eighth inning against Pittsburgh in 2017 but lost it on Gregory Polanco's homer.	Greinke pitched a one-hit shutout in 2009 against Seattle.	"I don't really think about (no-hitters) that much. I just assume I'll never throw one," he said, later adding: "Just probably be more hassle than anything."	The last Diamondbacks pitcher to throw a no-hitter was Edwin Jackson on June 25, 2010, against Tampa Bay.	Greinke improved to 6-1 with a 1.27 ERA in nine career starts against the Nationals.	"Do you try to be aggressive off a guy who is doing exactly what he wants to, or do you try to be patient? I don't know," Turner said. "I guess do the opposite of whatever we did today, because he was pretty good."	Washington starter Erick Fedde (1-1) allowed five runs and six hits over six innings.	The Nationals, fourth in the NL East, began an 11-game homestand that includes series against the division-rival Phillies and Braves.	Avila's solo homer made it 3-0 in the second and Dyson hit a two-run shot off Fedde in the fourth.	STREAK ENDED	Rendon went 0 for 3, ending his on-base streak at 27 games.	GO EAST, YOUNG MEN	The Diamondbacks are 14-3 in games played in the Eastern time zone this season.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: Avila strained his left calf and exited in the eighth inning. "It will cost me some time," he said. "Got to get an MRI and see how bad it is." . 1B-3B Jake Lamb (strained left quadriceps) was 1 for 4 with two runs Wednesday for Triple-A Reno. Lamb is 3 for 9 with two walks and three runs in the first three games of his rehabilitation assignment.	Nationals: Manager Dave Martinez said RHP Koda Glover (right forearm strain) has been shut down for six weeks after experiencing pain and receiving a PRP injection. ... 1B Ryan Zimmerman (plantar fasciitis) has begun running on a treadmill, one of his final hurdles before going on a rehab assignment. ... 1B Matt Adams (left oblique strain), who missed Tuesday's game, took batting practice before this one.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: LHP Robbie Ray (5-3, 3.54) is 0-4 with a 6.26 ERA in five career starts against the Nationals.	Nationals: RHP Max Scherzer (4-5, 2.83) has a 0.67 ERA with 39 strikeouts, five walks, zero home runs allowed and a .198 opponents' batting average over his past four starts.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Even without full use of his powerful right arm, Shohei Ohtani possesses one of baseball's most diverse skillsets.	It all showed in a memorable performance Thursday night.	Ohtani became the first Japanese-born player to hit for the cycle, helping the Los Angeles Angels beat the Tampa Bay Rays 5-3 after a delay caused by a power outage.	"You need some power to hit the home run, some speed to accomplish a triple," Ohtani said through a translator. "To be able to do that at the major league level is going to lead to a lot of confidence. The important thing now is to try to continue this tomorrow."	Ohtani hit a three-run homer in the first inning and completed the feat with a single on a 3-2 pitch in the seventh. It was the Angels' sixth and final hit of the game.	"I wasn't necessarily trying to hit a single," he said. "I was just trying to get on base, whether it was a base on balls or any other way because it was still a close game."	After a triple in his third at-bat, Ohtani's cycle quest became the focus of the game.	"People were talking about it. It's not like a no-hitter when no one mentions it," said Angels manager Brad Ausmus, who was most impressed that the left-handed hitting Ohtani got his first three hits off a left-handed pitcher.	"We forget how young he is," Ausmus added. "He's in a new country, his second year here. He's 24 years old. He carries a lot on his shoulders, but he still stands pretty tall."	Ohtani is the eighth Angels player to hit for the cycle and the first since Mike Trout on May 21, 2013.	"There's been so many other great Japanese players before me. Being the first to accomplish it makes me very happy," he said.	Albert Pujols also homered for the Angels, becoming the sixth player ever with 200 home runs in each league. He hit 445 in 11 seasons with St. Louis and has 200 in eight years with the Angels, including 12 this season.	Ohtani's homer came on Ryan Yarbrough's 10th pitch of the game after a double by Tommy La Stella and a walk to Trout. It was Ohtani's eighth homer of the season and sixth in 11 games.	He led off the third with a double and tripled in the fifth before Pujols' home run. A two-out single in the seventh completed the cycle in just four plate appearances, and fans at Tropicana Field gave him a standing ovation.	The game was held up 36 minutes by a power delay in the fourth with the Angels leading 3-0. The power outage was caused by a fire at a nearby substation.	"I don't think I've ever seen that happen before," Yarbrough said. "Of all things, it was kind of cool when everyone turned their (cellphone) lights on. It kind of looked like a little concert and then people got energized into the game after that. That was kind of cool."	Tommy Pham had two hits and drove in two for the Rays, who have lost three straight.	Yarbrough (5-3) gave up five runs and five hits (all for extra bases) in six innings, striking out four.	Angels starter Tyler Skaggs (5-6) pitched five innings, giving up three runs and seven hits while striking out five in the Angels' third straight win.	Cam Bedrosian pitched the ninth for his first save.	OHTANI BACK ON A MOUND SOON	Ohtani won't pitch again until next season, but he might be on a mound again within a month. Relegated to a DH role while recovering from Oct. 1 Tommy John surgery, the 2018 AL Rookie of the Year might be throwing off a mound before the All-Star break. "I won't say it's probable, but it's possible," Ausmus said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: INF David Fletcher was a late scratch due to left shoulder soreness but entered the game at 3B in the eighth inning. ...

NEW YORK --  Paul DeJong hit an RBI single off Edwin Diaz in the 10th inning, and the St. Louis Cardinals completed their rally from a night earlier to beat the New York Mets 5-4 Friday.	The game Thursday was suspended after 8 1/2 innings, moments after the Cardinals' Harrison Bader drove in the tying run with a two-out double off Diaz in the rain.	Play resumed where things left off, and a small crowd at Citi Field saw Carlos Martinez (1-0) pitch a 1-2-3 bottom of the ninth. Diaz (1-4) then jogged out of the bullpen to continue his outing.	Pinch-hitter Yairo Munoz led off with a single, stole second and advanced to third on Matt Carpenter's groundout. DeJong followed by grounding a ball into left field to score Munoz.	Jordan Hicks pitched perfectly through the bottom of the inning for his 14th save.	The Cardinals gathered around the mound for congratulatory handshakes, then returned to the clubhouse for a quick break before playing the second game of the series.	Rain pounded down Thursday night as New York took a 4-2 lead into the ninth. Umps signaled for the tarp, but first baseman Pete Alonso and other Mets players lobbied hard to keep the game going.	After umpires and both managers met on the field, the grounds crew was waved off and play continued. St. Louis then rallied against Diaz, with Bader driving in the tying run before slipping between second and third. He was thrown out to end the inning.	The field was covered back up after that, and the suspension was announced 50 minutes later.	The game resumed at 6:10 p.m. Friday. In an odd scene, there was no anthem, no player introductions -- none of the hubbub that usually accompanies the start of a big league game. Moments before leading off the bottom of the ninth, Mets slugger Todd Frazier sat on a stool by the on-deck circle, chatting casually with fans. Frazier grounded out to short.	Bader finished the first game with three hits. DeJong was 1 for 4 and is now 25 for 71 (.352) against the Mets with 17 extra-base hits.	AN OK K	Mets catcher Wilson Ramos had a most memorable strikeout Thursday night, going down looking in the fourth moments after his wife, Yely, surprised him with the news that she's pregnant with the couple's third child. She ran down the steps near the on-deck circle holding a sign saying "We're pregnant! Wilson, this is your 3rd child. We love you!"	Ramos chuckled between practice swings, then tried to focus on his at-bat. He was struck out by Jack Flaherty.	"I don't like putting another thing in my head when I go to the plate, but that moment made me so excited," Ramos said. "I tried to hit a homer or do something good. I got a strikeout, nothing good. But I was still happy for the rest of the game."	TRAINERS ROOM	Cardinals: RHP Dominic Leone was recalled from Triple-A Memphis to be the 26th man for the second game.	Mets: RHP Taylor Bashlor was brought up from Triple-A Syracuse to be New York's 26th man.	UP NEXT	Cardinals RHP Daniel Ponce de Leon (0-0, 1.80) starts in place of injured Adam Wainwright.

BOSTON --  After trailing early by five runs, the Boston Red Sox slugged their way to a comeback victory.	Xander Bogaerts hit a solo homer in the seventh inning, Boston's fifth long ball of the game, and the Red Sox rallied to beat the Texas Rangers 7-6 on Thursday night.	"We found a way to win today instead of finding a way to lose," manager Alex Cora said.	Five players homered for Boston, which outlasted Texas to earn a split of the four-game series. The finale took 4 hours, 6 minutes.	All seven runs for Boston came on homers. Jackie Bradley Jr. hit a three-run shot in the second and the Red Sox also got solo homers from J.D. Martinez, Michael Chavis and Rafael Devers.	Bogaerts was the last to go deep for Boston, driving a pitch from Peter Fairbanks (0-1) out to left and completing a wild comeback for the Red Sox, who lost the first two games of the series.	Brandon Workman (4-1) got the win with a scoreless seventh despite walking two as Red Sox pitchers struggled with their command throughout the long night.	Josh Smith, the eighth pitcher for Boston, hit the first batter he faced in the ninth but managed to keep the Rangers off the board and picked up his first save.	Elvis Andrus drove in three runs on three singles for the Rangers. Logan Forsythe hit a two-run double and Hunter Pence had an RBI double for Texas, which stranded 14 runners.	It was the second straight night the Rangers lost by a single run.	"We had a chance, honestly, to win all four games. We had a chance to sweep them," manager Chris Woodward said. "You've got a 6-1 lead against this team, you've got to beat them."	Texas tagged lefty David Price for five hits and six quick runs. Price threw 49 pitches in just 1 1/3 innings before he was pulled.	"Obviously, we wanted David to go deep and pitch well but we never felt that we were out of the game," Cora said. "Honestly, today it was a different vibe in the dugout. It was good."	The Red Sox were able to slug their way back into it against Adrian Sampson, who won his previous five starts. Chavis homered in the fourth and Devers went deep in the fifth to tie it.	Martinez also hit a solo shot in the first off Sampson, who allowed four homers in five innings. He gave up six runs and seven hits.	Price struggled from the start, needing 38 pitches to get out of the first with the Rangers leading 4-0. He hit Shin-Soo Choo with a pitch and walked Delino DeShields before Elvis Andrus followed with an RBI single. Pence doubled off the top of the wall in right for a 2-0 lead, and Forsythe hit a two-run double.	Price struck out Jeff Mathis to start the second, but didn't get another out. He plunked Choo again, DeShields doubled and Andrus drove in both with a single.	The Rangers didn't score again.	"That's baseball," Pence said. "You've got to play all nine and you've got to keep finding ways to get runs in. It just didn't happen tonight."	MUCH APPRECIATED	Price cheered on his teammates from the dugout as the Red Sox chipped away at the lead.	"The bullpen came in and did an unbelievable job," Price said. "Our offense bailed me out and helped us win that game. That's the type of game we can rally around and keep going."	OFF THE WALL	Pence hit a drive in the first that bounced high off the top of the short wall in right field and came back into play for a double. Crew chief Angel Hernandez called for a review to see whether Pence had actually homered. The call stood after the review, and Pence stayed at second with his fifth RBI of the series. He finished the game 3 for 4.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: Choo also was hit by a pitch in the eighth inning Wednesday and scored the tying run before Boston rallied to win 4-3 in the ninth.	Red Sox: 1B-DH Steve Pearce (lower back strain) will start a rehab assignment Friday with Class A Lowell. ... LHP Brian Johnson, on the injured list since April 6 with left elbow inflammation, will get a start this weekend in Baltimore, likely on Sunday but possibly Saturday.	UP NEXT	Rangers: RHP Jesse Chavez (2-2) will start Friday night when Texas opens a three-game set at Cincinnati.	Red Sox: LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (6-4, 5.00 ERA) faces Orioles RHP Andrew Cashner (6-2, 4.73) on Friday night at Camden Yards. Rodriguez is the only Boston starting pitcher with six wins this season.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

OMAHA, Neb. --  Nicky Lopez couldn't have imagined a better homecoming to Omaha.	The rookie hit his first major league home run in the stadium where he played college ball, starting the Kansas City Royals' scoring in a 7-3 win over the Detroit Tigers on Thursday night in the first big league regular season game played in Nebraska.	"I knew a lot of college friends and coaches here and people around the community," said Lopez, who played for Creighton University from 2014-16. "I didn't know it was gone. I knew I hit it pretty good, maybe a double or triple."	The game at TD Ameritrade Park coincided with the buildup to the College World Series, which begins Saturday. All eight CWS teams were among the sellout crowd of 25,454 and participated in a pregame ceremony with the major league teams.	"It was fun. The energy level was fun," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "Every time I turned around, all I saw was Royals hats and shirts. That was great to see. I wanted us to come in here and put on a good show for our fans in Omaha."	Lopez hit just one home run in 75 games at TD Ameritrade as a collegian. The second baseman returned to Omaha 8 for 61 in his previous 15 games and sat out Wednesday's game in Kansas City before going 2 for 4.	In his first trip to the plate, he lined Matthew Boyd's 1-1 pitch into the right field bullpen leading off the third inning. Martin Maldonado followed with a double and came home when Boyd was called for a balk.	The Royals tacked on three runs in the fourth and one each the next two innings on their way to their highest run total since May 29. They had scored a total of eight runs over their previous four games.	Lopez got a high-five from Yost when he returned to the dugout after his home run.	"The funny thing was I asked him, `Nicky, is your dad sitting home watching?" Yost said. "He said, `Yeah.' I said, `I hate to tell you the (ESPN) TV truck just broke down and they weren't televising then.' That was a shame."	Kansas City starter Homer Bailey (5-6) gave up a pair of singles, walked three, hit a batter and struck out six before Jorge Lopez came on to start the seventh. Dawel Lugo tripled past diving right fielder Whit Merrifield and scored on a groundout for the Tigers' first run.	The Royals won two of three over the Tigers for their first series win since April 12-14 against Cleveland.	"We needed to get that over with," Yost said. "We needed to score some runs because we've been pitching really well. Homer was right on track with that tonight. He threw the ball extremely well. Nice to have a little leeway to make a mistake, which he didn't have."	Boyd (5-5), who pitched for Oregon State in the 2013 CWS and threw a four-hit shutout against Indiana, lasted four innings and threw 94 pitches in his shortest outing in six starts.	"He threw a ton of pitches," Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire said. "That's not the norm for him. He kind of messed around with some of those guys who are real fast. He needed to attack those guys and keep them off the bases, and he kind of got behind and put too many people on base and then it turns into a bloop here, a bloop there. It wasn't his night."	Merrifield doubled twice and drove in two in his return to Omaha. He was the hero of South Carolina's 2010 national championship team, singling in the winning run against UCLA in the deciding game of the CWS finals in the last game played at Rosenblatt Stadium.	"Great crowd. Great to see a sellout," Merrifield said. "They did a great job of putting this on.  It was cool to come back. Different stadium and different feel, but it was cool to relive it."	TRAINING ROOM	Tigers: CF JaCoby Jones was hit by a pitch in the elbow in the fifth inning and left the game in the sixth. ... SS Niko Goodrum returned to the lineup after missing one game after fouling a ball off his kneecap Tuesday. ... Casey Mize, the No. 1 overall pick of the 2018 draft, left his Thursday start for Double-A Erie after 2 1/3 innings with right shoulder soreness, vice president of player development Dave Littlefield said.	Royals: 1B Lucas Duda (back) was reinstated from the injured list after missing 42 games. He hit .286 with a homer and three doubles in his 12-game rehab assignment at Omaha. .... LF Alex Gordon, who grew up 50 miles away in Lincoln and played for Nebraska, was out of the lineup with a shoulder bruise, the result of getting hit by a pitch Wednesday. ... 3B Hunter Dozier (thorax) will take batting practice on the field Friday and is getting closer to returning, manager Ned Yost said.	UP NEXT	RHP Brad Keller (3-8, 4.29 ERA) is scheduled to start Friday night when the Royals open a six-game road trip at Minnesota. LHP Ryan Carpenter (1-3, 7.89) will start the Tigers' opener of a three-game home weekend set against Cleveland.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.	Jhoulys Chacín has agreed to a guaranteed $1.25 million, one-year contract with the Rockies.

CHICAGO --  White Sox manager Rick Renteria thought his team had a lot of good at-bats Thursday night.	The biggest and best one belonged to Leury Garcia.	"Huge," Renteria said. "It was a great at-bat."	Garcia hit a tiebreaking solo homer off Adam Ottavino in the seventh inning, lifting Chicago to a 5-4 victory over the New York Yankees.	Garcia looked at two called strikes from Ottavino before battling back and sending the 11th pitch he saw over the wall in right-center for his fourth homer .	"I just tried to swing at good pitches," Garcia said through a translator. "I wasn't looking for a homer. I just wanted to try to get on base."	It was the first time Ottavino (2-2) allowed homers in consecutive appearances in almost two years. The right-hander, who signed a $27 million, three-year contract with New York in January, served up a solo shot to Cleveland's Jake Bauers in the seventh inning of Sunday's 7-6 victory over the Indians.	"I give a lot of credit to him for fighting me and getting into that spot," Ottavino said of Garcia's homer. "I didn't want to walk him, so I gave him a pretty good pitch to hit and he didn't miss it there."	Tim Anderson also connected during Chicago's fourth win in five games, and four relievers combined for 3 1/3 innings of three-hit ball. Batting in the top two slots in the lineup, Garcia and Anderson combined for four hits and five RBI.	Evan Marshall (2-0) got three outs for the win, and Aaron Bummer worked the ninth for his first career save after regular closer Alex Colome threw a season-high 39 pitches in Tuesday's 7-5 victory over Washington. Marshall hasn't allowed an earned run in 16 appearances this year.	"It's just like kind of your first big league win, first big league save," Bummer said. "It's awesome."	Brett Gardner homered for the Yankees, who have dropped seven of 10. Clint Frazier finished with three hits.	"We'll get it going," manager Aaron Boone said. "This is all part of it; it's not all smooth sailing all the time."	New York jumped out to a 4-0 lead behind Gardner, who drove a 3-1 pitch from Ivan Nova over the wall in right for a two-run drive in the fourth. Gardner also reached on a fielder's choice in the second, advanced on a wild pitch and scored on Frazier's single.	Gardner has six hits in his last four games after beginning June with a 1-for-23 slide. He also homered during the Yankees' doubleheader split against the Mets on Tuesday.	J.A. Happ appeared to be well on his way to his fourth straight win before running into trouble in the fifth. Garcia got Chicago on the board with an RBI double, and Anderson followed with a drive to center for a tying three-run shot .	Happ retired the next three batters after Anderson's 10th homer, but the damage was done. The left-hander yielded five hits and walked four in five innings.	"I found a way to get out of the fourth and should've learned a lesson to attack and get ahead," he said. "Went out there for the fifth and didn't get it done."	IL AGAIN	The Yankees placed Kendrys Morales on the 10-day injured list with a left calf strain. The first baseman/designated hitter is the 20th player to go on the IL this year for New York, matching its total for the entire 2018 season.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: OF-DH Giancarlo Stanton is taking his minor league rehab assignment to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre for its weekend series at Durham. If Stanton gets through this weekend with no problems, Boone said the slugger could be activated before Tuesday's game against Tampa Bay. ... OF Aaron Judge (strained left oblique) could join Stanton with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre this weekend.	White Sox: INF Yoan Moncada was held out for the second straight game after leaving Monday's loss to Washington because of upper back tightness. He said he might be able to return this weekend. "I want to be sure that when I come back I am 100 percent healthy because I don't want to have any lingering issues going forward," Moncada said through a translator.	UP NEXT	White Sox right-hander Lucas Giolito (9-1, 2.28 ERA) goes for his eighth straight win when he faces Yankees left-hander CC Sabathia (3-3, 3.96 ERA) on Friday night. Giolito is 8-0 with a 1.69 ERA in 10 starts since his only loss of the season April 6 against Seattle. Sabathia has dropped his last two starts, but is 19-7 with a 3.67 ERA versus Chicago for his career.	---	Jay Cohen can be reached at https://twitter.com/jcohenap	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

Blackmon homered twice to back a 10-strikeout start from Gray, and the Rockies beat the Padres 9-6 on Thursday night despite two homers from Manny Machado.	Blackmon added a two-run triple and finished with four hits and four RBI to continue his hot start to June. Trevor Story also homered for the Rockies, who have won 11 of 12 at Coors Field.	Blackmon returned Saturday from a calf injury that sidelined him for two weeks and immediately started hitting. He is batting .440 in six games with four home runs and 10 RBI.	"Seeing how well he is in the zone right now, he's in his own place," Gray said. "It's scary for other pitchers and good for us."	Gray has been a scary matchup for the Padres and is now 10-3 with 135 strikeouts in 18 career starts against San Diego. The strikeouts are the most against the Padres in Colorado franchise history.	San Diego left-hander Matt Strahm (2-6) allowed six runs and seven hits over 3 1/3 innings and added two hits in his return from the 10-day injured list. All four leadoff hitters got on against him.	"He got snakebitten by the leadoff batters getting on," Padres manager Andy Green said. "It's tough pitching in this ballpark, and it's tough when the leadoff guy gets on five of your first six innings."	Gray (6-5) got off to a rough start before settling down. San Diego scored twice in the first inning on a double by Eric Hosmer and a single by Machado. Colorado answered with three runs in the bottom of the inning, with Ian Desmond's two-run double giving the Rockies a 3-2 lead.	Five of the first six batters Gray faced got hits, but he allowed just four hits over the last 5 2/3 innings.	"Jon hung in there and kept his poise, kept making pitches," Rockies manager Bud Black said.	Story extended the lead with a two-run homer in the second, his 16th.	Blackmon took over with home runs to center field leading off the fourth and sixth innings, then hit his triple off Matt Wisler in the seventh to give the Rockies a four-run lead.	Both of Blackmon's two-homer games this season have come against the Padres. He has 14 homers.	"I don't hit a ton of homers to center, but I barreled that one up pretty good but I hit it pretty high," Blackmon said of his first home run.	Machado cut the deficit to 6-4 with a homer in the fifth and added another solo shot in the ninth, his 12th of the season. Five of Machado's eight hits in June have come in the last four games.	"It's just a matter of time before he goes off," Green said. "We expect him to carry us at some point this year, and we're starting to see the signs of that."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: RHP Robert Stock was optioned to Triple-A El Paso to make room on the roster for Strahm. ... OF Franchy Cordero (right elbow strain) left Wednesday's rehab assignment with a left leg injury. "Still waiting on a full rundown of where he is today," Green said. "He tweaked the quad yesterday, wait and see how he responds to that. You don't typically know about those things until you get a couple of days faster."	Rockies: Activated LHP Mike Dunn from the 10-day injured list and optioned LHP Phillip Diehl to Triple-A Albuquerque. Dunn missed just 10 days with a left A/C joint inflammation.	SHOUT OUT TO THE NORTH	Black and NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard both attended San Diego State, so the Rockies manager took time out to recognize the Toronto Raptors winning the title Thursday night.	"A San Diego State alum was part of an NBA championship team. I wanted to wish Kawhi congratulations on the Raptors winning the NBA championship. Nice going, Kawhi and the Raptors," he said.	Black quickly added kind words for Golden State's head coach.	"I'm a Steve Kerr fan, too. For the record," he said. "I've played golf with Steve Kerr. Good guy, good coach."	UP NEXT	The Padres will send RHP Cal Quantrill (1-2, 4.85) against Colorado RHP Jeff Hoffman (1-3, 8.06) on Friday night. Quantrill, a rookie, is making his sixth career start and first against an NL West opponent. Hoffman is 1-1 with a 0.77 in four career games -- two starts -- against San Diego.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.

LOS ANGELES --  Cody Bellinger's recent 0-for-13 slump appears to have been a mere blip in a memorable season so far.	Bellinger hit a pair of home runs, Max Muncy and David Freese each added a two-run shot and the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Chicago Cubs 7-3 Thursday night in the opener of a four-game series.	The leading vote-getter in All-Star balloting, Bellinger is batting .358 with 22 homers and 57 RBI.	The slugger ended his skid at the plate in a loss at the Angels earlier this week. Now he's back home, where Bellinger has 14 homers and has hit safely in 28 of 32 games.	"A lot of work in the cage and tried to get back to where I was," he said. "We're good at bouncing back and forgetting about the past, treat every day like it's a new day."	Bellinger belted a two-run homer in the fourth inning. He added a solo shot in the seventh and drew chants of "MVP! MVP!"	"Just don't think of him as a hitter -- he's a great athlete," Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. "He plays all over the place, he plays every position well, he can run."	The NL West-leading Dodgers rallied from a 3-0 deficit after Kyle Schwarber and Kris Bryant hit leadoff homers against Clayton Kershaw in the early innings.	The Cubs arrived in Los Angeles having just ended a five-game road skid, but they've lost eight of 10 away from home. The loss dropped them a game behind the NL Central-leading Milwaukee Brewers, who were idle.	It wasn't a great night for either team's left-handed ace.	Jon Lester, a three-time World Series champion, gave up three homers. Kershaw, a three-time NL Cy Young Award winner, allowed two.	Kershaw (6-1) yielded three runs and seven hits in six innings. He struck out eight and walked two.	"It's not great, but you can live with that," Kershaw said.	Julio Urias earned his third save with three scoreless innings of relief.	Lester (5-5) gave up six runs and nine hits in five innings. He struck out seven and walked one.	"They've got great hitters," he said. "Bellinger's probably one of the better hitters I've seen, as far as his approach and not chasing, playing the game and doing all that."	Lester got hit in the left foot by a comebacker from Freese in the fourth and said it was sore after the game.	Schwarber's homer came on the first pitch of the game and Willson Contreras added an RBI single in the first.	Bryant hit his 14th homer in the third.	Lester retired 10 of his first 11 batters before getting hit hard in the fifth. With one out, he allowed five consecutive hits -- including two-run homers by Bellinger and Muncy -- that gave the Dodgers a 4-3 lead.	The Cubs turned a double play to escape the inning.	"It's great when those lefties get going like that against Lester," Kershaw said.	Freese slugged a two-run shot off Lester with two outs in the fifth, extending the lead to 6-3.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: RHP Carl Edwards Jr. didn't make the trip to LA because of stiffness in his upper back.	Dodgers: SS Corey Seager went on the injured list with a left hamstring strain, the result of getting hurt in the ninth inning Tuesday against the Angels.	UP NEXT	Cubs: RHP Kyle Hendricks (7-4, 3.00 ERA) has been strong over his last three starts. He has a 2.05 ERA with 20 strikeouts and two walks in that span.	Dodgers: LHP Rich Hill (3-1, 2.40) has averaged 10.80 strikeouts per nine innings and held Cubs batters to a .167 average in two career games. He has no record or ERA in those games.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

NEW YORK --  Paul DeJong hit an RBI single off Edwin Diaz in the 10th inning, and the St. Louis Cardinals completed their rally from a night earlier to beat the New York Mets 5-4 Friday.	The game Thursday was suspended after 8 1/2 innings, moments after the Cardinals' Harrison Bader drove in the tying run with a two-out double off Diaz in the rain.	Play resumed where things left off, and a small crowd at Citi Field saw Carlos Martinez (1-0) pitch a 1-2-3 bottom of the ninth. Diaz (1-4) then jogged out of the bullpen to continue his outing.	Pinch-hitter Yairo Munoz led off with a single, stole second and advanced to third on Matt Carpenter's groundout. DeJong followed by grounding a ball into left field to score Munoz.	Jordan Hicks pitched perfectly through the bottom of the inning for his 14th save.	The Cardinals gathered around the mound for congratulatory handshakes, then returned to the clubhouse for a quick break before playing the second game of the series.	Rain pounded down Thursday night as New York took a 4-2 lead into the ninth. Umps signaled for the tarp, but first baseman Pete Alonso and other Mets players lobbied hard to keep the game going.	After umpires and both managers met on the field, the grounds crew was waved off and play continued. St. Louis then rallied against Diaz, with Bader driving in the tying run before slipping between second and third. He was thrown out to end the inning.	The field was covered back up after that, and the suspension was announced 50 minutes later.	The game resumed at 6:10 p.m. Friday. In an odd scene, there was no anthem, no player introductions -- none of the hubbub that usually accompanies the start of a big league game. Moments before leading off the bottom of the ninth, Mets slugger Todd Frazier sat on a stool by the on-deck circle, chatting casually with fans. Frazier grounded out to short.	Bader finished the first game with three hits. DeJong was 1 for 4 and is now 25 for 71 (.352) against the Mets with 17 extra-base hits.	AN OK K	Mets catcher Wilson Ramos had a most memorable strikeout Thursday night, going down looking in the fourth moments after his wife, Yely, surprised him with the news that she's pregnant with the couple's third child. She ran down the steps near the on-deck circle holding a sign saying "We're pregnant! Wilson, this is your 3rd child. We love you!"	Ramos chuckled between practice swings, then tried to focus on his at-bat. He was struck out by Jack Flaherty.	"I don't like putting another thing in my head when I go to the plate, but that moment made me so excited," Ramos said. "I tried to hit a homer or do something good. I got a strikeout, nothing good. But I was still happy for the rest of the game."	TRAINERS ROOM	Cardinals: RHP Dominic Leone was recalled from Triple-A Memphis to be the 26th man for the second game.	Mets: RHP Taylor Bashlor was brought up from Triple-A Syracuse to be New York's 26th man.	UP NEXT	Cardinals RHP Daniel Ponce de Leon (0-0, 1.80) starts in place of injured Adam Wainwright. LHP Steven Matz (5-4, 3.88) is up for the Mets.	---	Follow Jake Seiner: https://twitter.com/Jake-Seiner	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

WASHINGTON --  The Washington Nationals gave Max Scherzer early run support, and that made his job a lot easier Friday night.	Scherzer struck out 10 in seven innings, Anthony Rendon and Howie Kendrick homered and the Nationals defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks 7-3.	Scherzer (5-5) leads the National League with 136 strikeouts. He gave up two runs and three hits, including home runs by Carson Kelly and Nick Ahmed.	"Every five days, you know what you're going to get from Max," Washington manager Dave Martinez said. "He's really good. That's why he's an ace."	The 10 strikeouts in this game gave him 2,585 for his career and moved Scherzer past Hall of Famers Bob Feller and Warren Spahn into 27th place on the all-time list.	This was Scherzer's third straight win overall and he improved to 7-0 in nine starts against Arizona -- he started his big league career with the Diamondbacks in 2008.	The Nationals have scored three runs or less in 10 of the 15 games Scherzer has started. Scherzer was delighted to get the offensive help.	"We got some big home runs. When our offense can go like this, it just makes it easier to pitch," Scherzer said. "You can go out there, be aggressive towards their guys and try to throw up strikes and just try to throw up goose eggs."	The Nationals scored three times in the third off Robbie Ray (5-4) on an RBI double by Trea Turner, a sacrifice fly from Victor Robles and a run-scoring single by Juan Soto.	Ahmed homered in the fifth to pull Arizona within 3-2 but that was all they could do against Scherzer.	"He throws a lot of strikes and attacks," Ahmed said. "You can't go up there and try to take and work the count. He's one of the best."	Rendon and Kendrick hit solo home runs in the sixth, and Washington added two more in the seventh on Robles' RBI single and Rendon's sacrifice fly.	DOUBLE YOUR PLEASURE	Washington OF Michael A. Taylor had stolen just two bases this season coming into the game, but swiped two in the seventh and later scored an insurance run.	COSTLY ERROR	Ray made a throwing error on Scherzer's sacrifice bunt trying for a force at second base that helped the Nationals in their three-run third. Three of the next four Washington hitters drove in runs for a 3-1 lead.	"I just made a bad throw," Ray said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: C Alex Avila (strained left calf) was put on the injured list after being hurt in Thursday's win. Manager Torey Lovullo said Avila will have an MRI and said the catcher is optimistic he will not be out for long. C Caleb Joseph was recalled from Triple-A Reno to take Avila's spot. ... Lovullo said RHP Jon Duplantier (right shoulder inflammation) had an MRI that was "very positive" and will go on anti-inflammatories and is not going to throw for six or seven days. He will be examined after that.	Nationals: 1B Ryan Zimmerman (plantar fasciitis right foot) ran on the treadmill Thursday and continued with baseball activities Friday. Zimmerman was placed on the 10-day injured list April 28. . RHP Justin Miller (right shoulder inflammation) received an unspecified injection Friday, according to Martinez. Miller was "shut down" this week after throwing. He has been on the 10-day injured list since May 18.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: Taylor Clarke (1-2, 5.26) will make his sixth major league start in Saturday's game. It will be the first time he has pitched against Washington.	Nationals: RHP Stephen Strasburg (7-3, 3.36) now has won four in a row. His last loss came on May 12, and the right-hander has given up only two homers in his last eight starts.	--	More AP MLB:https://apnews.com/tag/MLB andhttps://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

BALTIMORE --  Just ahead of the summer heat, the Boston Red Sox are warming up to the idea of bashing their way into contention for another trip to the playoffs.	J.D. Martinez hit two of Boston's season-high six home runs , and the Red Sox staged another impressive power display at the expense of the Baltimore Orioles' beleaguered pitching staff in a 13-2 rout Friday night.	One night after slamming five homers against Texas, Boston went one better against the dreadful Orioles, who yielded 17 hits to Toronto on Thursday night.	Brock Holt got the Red Sox rolling with a two-run drive in the second inning, his first home run in 62 plate appearances this season. Christian Vazquez and Martinez went deep in the fourth inning, and Jackie Bradley Jr., Michael Chavis and Martinez connected off Dan Straily in a five-run fifth for an 11-1 lead.	"For us, it's getting good weather," manager Alex Cora said. "It's been cold in Boston, and sometimes the ball doesn't carry. I know we haven't scored runs and hit with men in scoring position, but certain guys are getting close to who they are."	Bradley said of the two-game power surge: "It's a good sign."	Eduardo Rodriguez (7-4) allowed one run and six hits over seven innings. The left-hander, who started his professional career in the Orioles organization, leads Boston in wins this season.	Though the defending World Series champions are waffling in third place in the AL East, they might be ready to make a move. The Red Sox have won three straight, own a five-game road winning streak and still have two games left in this series against the team with the worst record in the big leagues.	"We haven't even been close to who we are. That's a cool thing," Cora said. "For as bad or inconsistent -- whatever you want to call it -- as we've been, we're in the hunt."	The Orioles burned through the bullpen on Thursday and lost Friday's scheduled starter, Andrew Cashner, to a blister. So Baltimore recalled Luis Ortiz from Triple-A Norfolk to pitch in his third big league game and summoned reliever Josh Rogers from the same minor league club.	Ortiz (0-1) gave up four runs, four hits and five walks in 3 1/3 innings. He was followed by Straily -- who surrendered four homers and seven runs in 1 1/3 innings -- and Rogers, who pitched the final 4 1/3 innings.	"We had very limited options tonight, honestly," manager Brandon Hyde said. "We were going to try to somehow navigate through with Ortiz, Dan and Rogers."	Ortiz was optioned back to Norfolk after being overwhelmed by Boston's bashers.	"I take what happened because I made mistakes out there," he said.	Trey Mancini hit a first-inning homer for the Orioles, who have lost their last two games by a combined 25-5 score and have a major league-worst minus-144 run differential.	PAPI ON THEIR MIND	The Red Sox hit the road but their hearts remain with former slugger David Ortiz, who's in a Boston hospital as he recovers from a gunshot wound suffered Sunday in his native Dominican Republic.	"We're getting updates every day," Cora said. "On the off-day when we get back (next Thursday), we'll have a chance to go visit him and spend time with him."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: Reliever Heath Hembree (strained right elbow) was placed on the 10-day injured list, retroactive to Tuesday. Hembree said the elbow is merely sore, and expects to miss the minimum amount of time. LHP Josh Taylor was recalled from Triple-A Pawtucket . ... LHP Brian Johnson (left elbow inflammation) returned from the IL and will likely start on Sunday if not used out of the bullpen beforehand. 1B/OF Sam Travis was optioned to Pawtucket. ...  1B Steve Pearce (back) began a rehab assignment on Friday with Class A short season Lowell, going 1 for 3 with an RBI. ... RHP Hector Velazquez (lower back strain) begins a rehab assignment on Saturday with Lowell.	Orioles: 3B Hanser Alberto left in the fifth inning after feeling ill. ... RHP Josh Lucas was placed on the IL with a right shoulder strain after pitching three innings on Thursday night. ... DH/OF Mark Trumbo is on a holding pattern in his bid to return from offseason knee surgery after receiving an injection Thursday. "The right thing to do is make sure Mark is right and his knee is OK," Hyde said. "I know he's disappointed and a little frustrated. I just feel bad for him." The 33-year-old Trumbo has not played since Aug. 19.	UP NEXT	Red Sox: Chris Sale (2-7, 3.52 ERA) starts the second game of the series Saturday, looking to expand a streak of 17 straight innings without allowing an earned run. He struck out 14 Orioles on May 8.	Orioles: Dylan Bundy (3-7, 4.50) has more losses against Boston (7) than any other team.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Blake Snell was upset with his performance but ecstatic over what his Tampa Bay teammates pulled off.	Tommy Pham hit a pair of RBI singles as the Rays suddenly broke loose, overcoming another subpar start by Snell and rallying past the Los Angeles Angels 9-4 on Friday night.	Held to one hit through five innings and trailing 4-0, the Rays scored five times in sixth and added four more runs in seventh. Pham singled home runs in both bursts.	"On the bright side, the team backed me up," Snell said. "For the hitters and the team to come back when I put them in a hole like that says a lot about this team and says a lot about the guys that here."	Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash used three of four bench players as pinch-hitters during the sixth.	"We talk about how we win games and we've got to count on 25 guys, we almost used 25 today," Cash said.	The win lifted the Rays one-half game ahead of the New York Yankees atop the AL East.	Snell, who is 4-5 this season, lasted just 3 1/3 innings, giving up four runs, five hits and four walks during a 79-pitch outing.	"I had a lot of time to think about it, and I just didn't come a hundred percent ready to go, more so on the mental side," Snell said. "Frustrating day."	The Rays (42-27) are 7-7 in games started by the AL Cy Young Award winner.	It was the fourth time this year Snell failed to finish five innings. He did it four times in 31 starts last year.	Angels starter Andrew Heaney was pulled after Austin Meadows hit a leadoff double in the sixth. Reliever Luis Garcia gave up run-scoring singles to Yandy Diaz and pinch-hitter Kevin Kiermaier before being replaced by Ty Buttrey (4-3).	Buttrey hit Guillermo Heredia with pitch, allowed a two-run single to Avisail Garcia and an RBI single by Pham as the Rays went up 5-4.	Ji-Man Cho hit a two-run homer in the seventh as the Rays tagged Cody Allen and pulled away.	"Obviously the way it ended up is tough but that's a rarity for our bullpen. When they've been handed a lead, they've been awesome," Heaney said.	Reliever Emilio Pagan (2-1) worked 1 1/3 scoreless innings.	Albert Pujols hit a sacrifice fly and Cesar Puello had an RBI single to put the Angels up 2-0 in the first.	After Snell intentionally walked Mike Trout to load the bases with two outs in the second, Shohei Ohtani battled back from an 0-2 count to draw a walk to make it 3-0.	"Baseball games aren't scripted and sometimes the other team comes back and that's what they did," Angels manager Brad Ausmus said.	Ohtani, who hit for the cycle in Thursday night's 5-3 win over the Rays, went 1 for 4 with a walk and stole a base.	The announced crowd on Pride Night was 21,598. Tampa Bay entered with a home attendance average of 13,952.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: 3B Tommy La Stella was scratched with left forearm tightness. ... OF Justin Upton (turf toe) could be back Monday.	Rays: Heredia departed with a bruised left hand but might play Saturday. ... INF Joey Wendle returned after missing 43 games with a fractured right wrist.	BIG TEST	Rays two-way prospect Brendan McKay is scheduled to start for Triple-A Durham Saturday against Triple-A Scranton Wilkes-Barre, which has rehabbing Yankees sluggers Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton.	UP NEXT	Angels rookie LHP Jose Suarez (1-1) faces Rays RHP Charlie Morton (8-0) on Saturday. Morton may need to continue keeping Trout and Pujols in check to extend his 21-start unbeaten streak, dating to last Aug. 17. Trout (3 for 12, one homer) and Pujols (7 for 30) are hitting a combined .238 against him.	QUOTABLE	"Once in a generation kind of guy. I love the way he goes about his business, too. He just does his job as well as maybe anybody that has ever done it. To the point where he was even criticized a little bit for not being more `that guy' but I love that. I think it's awesome that he's himself and just an awesome ballplayer." -- Morton on Trout.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

DETROIT --  Needing a home run for the cycle, Jake Bauers had a conversation with teammate Shane Bieber before heading to the plate in the eighth inning.	"I told him, `I don't know man, I think I'm just going to try and stay left-center, hit a base hit where the shortstop should be," Bauers said. "He's like, `Dude, you've got to try and hit a homer."	Bauers connected for a two-run shot that easily cleared the wall in right field, becoming the first Cleveland player to hit for the cycle since 2016. The Indians, who scored eight runs in the fourth inning, routed the Detroit Tigers 13-4 on Friday night.	Bauers hit an infield single and a triple in that fourth inning. He also hit a double in the second. His cycle came one night after Shohei Ohtani accomplished the same feat for the Los Angeles Angels.	The last Cleveland player to hit for the cycle was Rajai Davis, at Toronto on July 2, 2016.	Leonys Martin's three-run homer highlighted Cleveland's eight-run fourth. The Indians sent 13 men to the plate that inning, turning a 3-2 deficit into a 10-3 advantage. The first six batters of the inning reached base.	Adam Plutko (3-1) allowed two earned runs and five hits in six innings for Cleveland. He walked one and struck out six.	Ryan Carpenter (1-4) threw 92 pitches but only lasted three-plus innings. He allowed six earned runs, eight hits and four walks.	Miguel Cabrera and Brandon Dixon hit consecutive homers for Detroit in the second.	"We just didn't pitch or catch," Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire said. "I feel bad, because we had our fans here and then had another game like this. We hit the ball -- the back-to-back homers were fun -- but an eight-run inning just takes all the life out of you."	The 23-year-old Bauers came into the game hitting just .209, and he had a chat with manager Terry Francona before the game.	"I have a responsibility to try to help, but he's responsible for what happened, and I'm proud of him," Francona said. "We talked for a long time, but he's the one that did it."	Bauers opened the scoring with an RBI double in the second. The Indians led 2-0 before Cabrera and Dixon answered with solo shots.	Cleveland hit for the cycle as a team in the fourth. Roberto Perez and Bauers hit singles to start the inning, then came home on Martin's homer. The Indians later loaded the bases, and second baseman Harold Castro's one-out error allowed two runs to score.	Perez added a two-run double, and Bauers hit an RBI triple.	Bauers completed his cycle with a homer that went an estimated 406 feet and made it 13-3.	The game was played with three umpires after third-base ump Jim Wolf left in the first inning. There was no announcement of a reason for Wolf's departure.	MOVES	The Indians announced the signing of 32 of their 2019 draft picks, including right-hander Daniel Espino, their first-round selection.	The Tigers announced six signings, meaning they've agreed to terms with 21 of their 40 picks, so far.	After the game, Detroit announced that Carpenter was being optioned to Triple-A Toledo, and catcher Grayson Greiner was going on the 10-day injured list with a back strain. Before Saturday's game, the Tigers plan to recall left-hander Gregory Soto from Toledo and purchase the contract of catcher Bobby Wilson from Toledo.	Right-hander Tyson Ross (right ulnar nerve) has been transferred to the 60-day IL.	THE FUTURE	Detroit OF Nicholas Castellanos spoke at length to reporters before the game. His future with the rebuilding Tigers has been in doubt for a while.	"I've also had conversations with (general manager) Al (Avila) where him saying, like, it doesn't really make sense where we are right now in this process of a rebuild, to be handing out extensions," Castellanos said. "This was back in the end of last season. I don't have a college education, but I can pick up the pieces here and put a puzzle together. ... If I'm a gambling man, I don't see them offering me an extension at this point in time."
