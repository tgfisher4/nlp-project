CHICAGO -- The Twins are not built on just fundamentals and speed anymore.	Jason Kubel hit a go-ahead two-run homer in the seventh inning and Scott Baker pitched seven sharp innings, leading the Minnesota Twins to a 2-1 victory over the Chicago White Sox on Saturday.	Kubel hit the Twins' 10th home run in six games, and Minnesota has used the long ball to help win its fifth straight game.	"We've got some guys who can put it in the seats. We try to run around a little bit. but it's pretty easy when you hit it in the seats and you get to jog around," Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said. "It's all about these guys putting good swings on the ball. We can hit the ball out of the ballpark but we also have to execute."	Trailing 1-0 in the seventh inning, Jim Thome drew a leadoff walk against his former team. Thome was replaced for pinch-runner Alexi Casilla, but the move became unnecessary when Kubel connected on White Sox starter Freddy Garcia's 0-1 fastball and drove it into the center field seats for his first homer of the season.	"I haven't had any good feelings at all up until my first hit today, which I got a little bit lucky on. I've got a lot more confidence in myself and hopefully it carries over. I'm just happy it worked out the way it did today," Kubel said. "I got lucky [on the double], got a better feeling for myself and then I got a good pitch to hit and didn't miss it this time."	Jesse Crain got two outs in the eighth and stranded Mark Teahen at second, and Jon Rauch pitched a scoreless ninth inning for his fourth save in four opportunities.	Baker (1-1) rebounded after struggling through only 4 2/3 innings on opening day. On Saturday, he allowed one run on five hits. He struck out three and walked one.	"I made a couple of mechanical adjustments. I think I did enough between my starts to get a feel for where I needed to be mechanically to really throw the ball down and throw some good breaking pitches. That's always the test for me, if I'm not on top of the ball and driving pitches down my breaking pitches aren't sharp," said Baker.	Baker said his success against the White Sox is predicated on keeping the White Sox first two hitters off the bases.	"If you can keep [Juan] Pierre and [Gordon] Beckham off the bases, you have a pretty good shot at success. They've got a good lineup but if you keep those two guys off you'll be all right," Baker said.	Teahen doubled in the only White Sox run, who lost for the fourth straight game.	In his first start of the season, Garcia (0-1) made one mistake, to Kubel. He allowed just two runs on three hits. He struck out four and walked five.	"The good thing about this is I am very excited how Freddy threw the ball. I can go home and have a nice dinner and not think about it," White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen said. "A lot of people had doubts on Freddy, including myself on the way he pitched in Spring Training. I think Freddy Garcia proved everybody wrong. Freddy showed one more time, when the lights on you better beat him."	Five games into the season, the White Sox are 5 for 35 with runners in scoring position and are batting .186 on the season.	"I think a lot of guys are pressing, a lot of guys are trying to do too much," Guillen said. "I think I saw a couple of guys try to hit the ball out of the ballpark when they should be pleased and happy with a base hit. I think everybody wants to be a hero. I think that's the wrong approach at the plate."	The Twins had a chance to tack onto their lead in the eighth. They loaded the bases with no outs against reliever Randy Williams, but Scott Linebrink came in and got Michael Cuddyer to hit a soft liner to second baseman Beckham, he struck out Casilla and Kubel ended the inning with a groundout to first.	A.J. Pierzynski led off the fifth with a liner to center, and Twins center fielder Denard Span tried to make a sliding catch, but the ball got by Span and allowed Pierzynski to go into second for his first double of the season. After Alexei Ramirez moved Pierzynski over on a groundout, Teahen broke an 0 for 10 start with a double to the center field warning track to give the White Sox a 1-0 lead.	Game notes	 After a pinch-hitting Friday night, Thome was in the starting lineup against his former team. He was 0 for 2 with a strikeout and a walk. ... RHP Carl Pavano will start in the Twins home opener at the new Target Field on Monday. "For Pavano to get this is nice. It's a reward for him wanting to be a part of this ballclub," Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said.

DETROIT -- Jeremy Bonderman looked like a dependable pitcher again.	Bonderman gave up one hit in five innings and Magglio Ordonez had a two-run homer, leading the Detroit Tigers to a 4-2 win over the Cleveland Indians on Saturday.	The right-hander won and started for the first time at home in nearly two years, bouncing back from surgery that broke up a blood clot in his throwing shoulder.	"It was fun to just get back on the mound, compete and be who I am and not worry about my arm hurting," he said. "It's been a long journey back, but I'm hoping I got 35 more starts in and hopefully we can do something special."	Bonderman (1-0) retired the first 11 he faced, then allowed a run on a wild pitch, single and two walks to win for the first time since his last Comerica Park start on May 22, 2008.	He started on Opening Day for the Tigers in 2005 at the age of 22, the youngest pitcher to earn the honor since Dwight Gooden two decades earlier, and helped them reach the World Series the next season for the first time since 1984.	A circulation problem in his shoulder in 2008 stunted his career.	The Tigers, though, publicly counted on him being a starter this year and he rewarded their faith with a strong spring and first start.	"We were tickled to death, obviously," manager Jim Leyland said.	Bonderman needed some help to get the win.	Brad Thomas gave up a run as he matched a career high by pitching two innings, Fu-Te Ni retired two and Ryan Perry took the ball for the final 1 1/3 innings to pick up his first career save.	"It was a dream come true for me to come in the ninth for a save," the 23-year-old Perry said.	The Tigers have won three straight and four of five.	Mitch Talbot (0-1) allowed four runs, six hits and five walks in his debut with the Indians and fourth game in the majors.	He threw 38 pitches -- just half for strikes -- in the first inning before recovering well enough for stay in the game for 101 pitches over five innings.	"It didn't feel like anything was wrong mechanically, I just couldn't throw strikes," Talbot said. "Nothing felt different in the last two innings, but the pitches were there."	Johnny Damon singled in the first, ending a three-game hitless streak, and scored on Ordonez's no-doubt shot to left.	The Tigers scored two more in the third to take a 4-0 lead on Brandon Inge's RBI single and Scott Sizemore's sacrifice fly, the rookie's first RBI.	Bonderman struck out the top two hitters in Cleveland's lineup -- Asdrubal Cabrera and Grady Sizemore -- to open the fourth, inspiring "Let's go Bon-do!" chants from fans in the stands. Then, he walked Shin-Soo Choo on a full-count pitch. Choo advanced to third on a single and scored on a wild pitch.	"He was cruising along great, then it was encouraging to see him bounce back after that tough inning," catcher Alex Avila said.	Hafner's RBI single in the sixth pulled the Indians within two runs and they blew a chance to at least cut into the deficit two innings later. Ni hit two straight batters in the eighth, then struck out Hafner and Perry got Jhonny Peralta out swinging.	"You can't win a lot of games by scoring two," manager Manny Acta said. "But we're battling against some good pitching."	Game notes	 Bonderman was 0-1 with a 8.71 ERA in eight games last season, including only one start on June 8. ... Talbot, acquired in the offseason from Tampa Bay for C Kelly Shoppach, made his previous appearance in the majors for the Rays at Detroit on Sept. 28, 2008, and gave up five runs in 2 1/3 innings. He made the second start of his career in the majors. ... Ordonez was 1 for 3 -- dropping his batting average to .476 -- after opening the season with four multihit games in a row. ... Cabrera has a hit in each of Cleveland's five games. ... Sizemore struck out three times for the first time in one year and a day. ... Detroit's top draft pick last year, RHP Jacob Turner, threw five scoreless innings a year out of high school in his professional debut Friday for Class-A West Michigan. ... Leyland rested closer Jose Valverde along with relievers Joel Zumaya and Phil Coke.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CINCINNATI -- The shoulder was strong, the legs were fresh. Carlos Zambrano felt like he was taking the mound for the first time this season.	Pretty darn close.	Zambrano recovered from his horrific opening day start by pitching seven solid innings, and pinch-hitter Jeff Baker hit a tiebreaking homer in the eighth Saturday, sending the Chicago Cubs to a 4-3 victory over the Cincinnati Reds.	Zambrano (1-1) managed only four outs during the Cubs' 16-5 opening-day drubbing in Atlanta, a performance so fast and so futile -- eight runs -- that he spent the rest of the week aching for another chance. The right-hander held the Reds to six hits, including Brandon Phillips' homer, and struck out nine.	"I think I was fresh from the last time," Zambrano said. "Basically, this was my first start. I was excited today. I was hungry to go out there. My first outing was not good. I was anxious to go out there and pitch my game, and I did it today."	His solid start allowed the Cubs to stay away from the unproven middle of their bullpen. John Grabow allowed one hit in the eighth, and Carlos Marmol struck out three in the ninth for his second save in as many chances.	"From what we've experienced here the first five games, our starting pitcher going seven innings is probably the best remedy," manager Lou Piniella said. "We'll get the kids [relievers] work from time to time and get them sharp and hope they improve."	Baker hit his solo shot off left-hander Arthur Rhodes (0-1), Chicago's third homer of the game. Kosuke Fukudome and Alfonso Soriano also connected off Aaron Harang.	Baker saw a little bit of everything in his first at-bat off the bench this season. Rhodes threw him a changeup away, a fastball in and a slider that was down but over the plate.	"I don't really try to do too much [while] pinch-hitting," said Baker, who now has three career homers in that role. "More likely than not, you're going to fail. It's just about getting a good pitch and not missing it."	Rhodes wasn't too upset at the decisive pitch to Baker.	"Most guys come off the bench looking for a first-pitch fastball, so I started him out with a changeup," Rhodes said. "Then I threw him a fastball and a slider down and away, and he went down and got it."	Both starters were coming off tough times in their season openers. Harang usually gets the better of these matchups -- Zambrano was 1-5 in seven career starts against the Reds' ace coming in.	This time, they ended up essentially even, each giving up three runs in seven innings. Baker's homer -- his first hit in five at-bats this season -- put Zambrano in line for the win.	The Cubs' lineup has been overly reliant on homers so far, scoring 12 of its 17 runs that way. Five of Saturday's starters came in batting .200 or less -- Aramis Ramirez (.200), Marlon Byrd (.167), Geovany Soto (.167), Soriano (.143) and Ryan Theriot (.125).	The homer-or-nothing trend continued. Fukudome hit a two-run shot in the fourth, and Soriano led off the fifth with a homer that tied it at 3.	Harang lasted only five innings of a season-opening 11-6 loss to the Cardinals on Monday, throwing a lot of pitches. This time, he wasn't messing around. Harang's first seven pitches were strikes. He retired the first nine Cubs in order, throwing 29 strikes in 38 pitches.	"You learn from the rough patches," Harang said. "You learn from your mistakes and just go out and do what you can."	Game notes	 Zambrano threw 110 pitches. ... LH Ted Lilly's rehab start in the minors has been pushed back a second time because of his sore back. Lilly, on the 15-day DL following shoulder surgery, was expected to pitch on Sunday for Triple-A Iowa. Instead, he'll try to throw in a bullpen on Monday. ... Reds 3B Scott Rolen got a day off. He's a .182 career hitter against Zambrano. ... RH Mike Leake, the Reds' top draft pick last June, will make his debut on Sunday. Leake pitched for Arizona State last year. He'll be the 21st player since the draft began in 1965 to make the jump without appearing in a minor league game. The last was Xavier Nady with San Diego in 2000. ... RF Jay Bruce is in an 0 for 16 slump, one shy of his career high.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

NEW YORK -- The New York Mets had better watch out for guys named Willie. Or Willy. Or any other variation of the name.	Willie Harris made a game-ending diving catch to yet again thwart a Mets rally, well-traveled Willy Taveras drove in a career-high four runs and the Washington Nationals beat New York 4-3 on Saturday.	"It was a lot of tension on both sides of the field," Nationals manager Jim Riggleman said, exhaling in the clubhouse afterward.	John Lannan (1-1) teetered on the brink of disaster, giving up three runs in five erratic innings, before Tyler Clippard set down nine of the 10 batters -- seven strikeouts -- he faced. Matt Capps came on to close it out for Washington, but he sure made it an adventure.	After a leadoff single by Jose Reyes, Capps loaded the bases with a pair of walks. Batting with two outs, Rod Barajas lined a hard shot to left, but Harris came charging in on a dead run to snare the ball just before it hit the outfield grass.	"Once he hit it, my mind was made up -- 'Willie, go make this happen," Harris said.	It was the third time Harris helped save a game against the Mets. In 2007, with Atlanta, he leaped above the wall to rob Carlos Delgado of a tying homer in the ninth inning, and two years ago he robbed Ryan Church of extra bases with a diving grab in the ninth inning to maintain Washington's 1-0 lead.	"Anybody else in that situation, there's a good chance the ball falls in," Barajas said. "They put him in the right spot."	Barajas whirled around in frustration when the ball was caught, while Capps pumped his arm to celebrate his second save of the season. The Nationals poured from the dugout, with Taveras joining in the party.	The speedy outfielder singled and tripled in his first start for the Nationals, who signed him to a minor league contract in February after Oakland let him go. The A's had acquired him about a week earlier from Cincinnati, making it three teams in less than a month.	"I don't take anything personally. I'm glad I'm here," said Taveras, who showed up at camp unsure whether he'd even make the roster. "Every day, I'm just trying to do my best. Anything you can do to help the team win games."	The intrepid New York fans who came out on a chilly, windy April afternoon didn't have much to cheer about besides Reyes, and even that stopped once the game began.	The All-Star shortstop was in the lineup for the first time since May 20, after a stubborn hamstring injury last season required surgery and a hyperactive thyroid kept him out part of spring training. He went 1 for 4 from the leadoff spot and didn't fare much better in the field, committing an error in the sixth when he whiffed on a liner right at him.	"I feel happy I played a whole game without a problem," Reyes said. "I was a little shaky in the field. I just missed that ball. I should catch that ball, no question."	Mets starter Oliver Perez (0-1) was his typical, mercurial self, setting Washington down in order in the first before running into trouble in the second. He loaded the bases with two outs for Taveras, who scorched a liner into left-center to make it 2-0.	New York loaded the bases in its half of the inning, and Henry Blanco drove in a run with a sacrifice fly before Perez hit an RBI blooper that evened the score.	The Mets loaded the bases again the next inning, but the kind of bad luck that seemed to follow them all last season struck again. Jeff Francoeur nubbed a pitch into the dirt in front of the plate, and catcher Ivan Rodriguez stepped on home before firing to first for the rare 2-2-3 double play. Gary Matthews Jr. ended the inning with a ground out to first.	Taveras added his two-run single in the fourth that made it 4-2, and although the Mets managed a run in the fifth, they couldn't figure out the Nationals bullpen.	"I did everything I can, but I have to be very happy with that," said Perez, who allowed all four runs in 5 2-3 innings. "I feel very good about the pitching, but we didn't win."	NOTES: Washington 3B Ryan Zimmerman left the game as a precaution in the sixth inning with a tight left hamstring. Riggleman said he may give him a couple days off. ... The Nationals plan to activate former Mets RHP Livan Hernandez to start the series finale Sunday. ... The Mets optioned SS Ruben Tejada to Triple-A Buffalo to create a roster spot for Reyes.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

MILWAUKEE -- Yovani Gallardo signed a contract extension with the Milwaukee Brewers earlier in the week. The St. Louis Cardinals were the ones cashing in Saturday.	And at least for an afternoon, it was the Cardinals' Jaime Garcia who looked like the up-and-coming ace.	Yadier Molina hit a three-run homer and Gallardo struggled two days after getting a big raise from the Brewers, giving up six runs in five innings in the Cardinals' 7-1 victory.	"I didn't feel any extra pressure," Gallardo said. "I mean, I felt pretty good out there. I had all my pitches and was throwing them for strikes. Just that one pitch [to Molina] turns the whole ballgame around."	Maybe the new contract -- a $30.1 million, five-year deal that could be worth $42.5 million over six seasons -- didn't get to Gallardo (0-2). But the Cardinals sure did, with Albert Pujols also hitting a two-run single.	Now St. Louis will go for a three-game sweep of their NL Central rivals Sunday night, with Chris Carpenter facing Milwaukee's big offseason addition, Randy Wolf.	"It's very important to win the series and tomorrow we have a chance to sweep them," Molina said. "We have Carp on the mound and everybody knows Carp, he's a great pitcher."	But not everybody knows Garcia (1-0), who was sharp in his debut as the Cardinals' No. 5 starter, giving up a run and four hits in six innings.	Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said Garcia got some help from Molina, his catcher.	"They are one of the better teams against left-hand pitching and he was outstanding against them," La Russa said. "He made a lot of good pitches. He came out of his delivery once in a great while. 'Yaddy' tweaked him and got back in it."	Brewers sluggers Ryan Braun and Prince Fielder went a combined 0-for-8, including three strikeouts by Fielder.	Why was Garcia so effective?	"I don't know," Fielder said. "He just got us out. I mean, he wasn't anything different than what everybody else throws. We just didn't get the job done."	It was the second career start for Garcia, who was limited to a handful of minor league outings last season after having Tommy John surgery in September 2008. Garcia earned the Cardinals' No. 5 spot in spring training.	"People ask me about nerves and [pitching my] first game in a while," Garcia said. "But really when I go out there, it's, 'Just don't try to do too much. Keep it simple.'"	He held the Brewers scoreless with only two hits through the first five innings, then gave up a double to Casey McGehee and RBI single to Corey Hart in the sixth.	"If he was nervous, it didn't show," Molina said. "I'm pretty sure he was, but seeing him calm like that and the way he was today, that was impressive."	Brewers manager Ken Macha didn't think Gallardo threw the ball poorly, but the manager acknowledged that the talented 24-year-old tends to get "into a little bit of a rut" during games.	"It's something we're going to have to look at," Macha said.	Gallardo was roughed up in the second and fifth innings, retiring 10 straight batters in between. La Russa considered Saturday's outing an anomaly.	"You are not going to make a living scoring a lot of runs off of him," La Russa said.	After forcing three quick groundouts in the first inning, Gallardo got into trouble right away in the second.	He allowed a single to Matt Holliday and walked Colby Rasmus. Holliday scored on a single by Ryan Ludwick, and Rasmus went to third base on a wide throw home that resulted in an error on Braun.	Molina -- who hit a grand slam on opening day, the first of his career -- then hit his second home run of the season, putting a 1-0 fastball into the left field stands for a 4-0 Cardinals lead.	Gallardo settled down before struggling with his control again in the fifth.	Gallardo walked Garcia, then Skip Schumaker lined a ball into left field -- and seemed to surprise Braun by streaking to second base as the left fielder threw to third. Gallardo struck out Felipe Lopez, but Pujols singled sharply to score Garcia and Schumaker and give the Cardinals a 6-0 lead.	Claudio Vargas replaced Gallardo to start the sixth, and Rasmus smacked Vargas' first pitch into the second deck in right field.	Game notes	 Hart, formerly the Brewers' regular right fielder, started his second game of the season and had two hits. Veteran Jim Edmonds has started the other three. ... Garcia's first major league start came July 20, 2008, against San Diego. ... Brewers CF Carlos Gomez fouled a ball off his foot in the third inning but remained in the game.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- Franklin Gutierrez saved the Seattle Mariners with his bat and then with his glove.	Gutierrez drove in the go-ahead run to cap a three-run ninth inning and then made a leaping catch against the wall in right-center field as the Mariners ended a four-game skid with a 4-3 victory over the Texas Rangers on Saturday.	Gutierrez's spectacular grab came with one out in the ninth when he ranged into the gap to rob Elvis Andrus of extra bases.	"It was a tough catch, definitely," said Gutierrez, who extended his hitting streak to 11 games, dating to last season. "He hit it good. The ball was pretty much over the fence so I knew I had to take a chance to jump and see if I could catch the ball. It was big at that time because if I don't catch the ball, it's a [inside-the-park homer] and they tie the game."	Right fielder Ichiro Suzuki was impressed.	"It's a very tricky park in that corner so it's a tough play," Suzuki said through an interpreter. "It happens in an instant. You can only make that play in an instant. He's desperate to catch that ball."	Seattle's comeback came against closer Frank Francisco, who blew his second straight save opportunity. Francisco (0-2) allowed three runs and three hits while retiring only one batter.	"I'm missing a lot in the middle" of the plate, Francisco said. "I wish it would be the opposite, but I have to deal with it."	Texas manager Ron Washington was noncommittal when asked if Francisco had lost his job.	"Stay tuned," he replied.	Suzuki, Ken Griffey Jr. and Gutierrez had consecutive RBI singles in the ninth for Seattle.	Casey Kotchman led off with a single, Rob Johnson walked and Jack Wilson sacrificed the runners to second and third. Suzuki singled up the middle to make it 3-2 and Griffey's pinch-hit single to center drove in Johnson to tie it at 3 and chase Francisco. Gutierrez followed with a single between third and short off Darren O'Day to give the Mariners the lead.	The timely hitting was something the Mariners had been searching for since last winning on opening day. Seattle got four hits in the ninth against the Texas bullpen, and out-hit the Rangers 12-7.	"We had the right guys up in the right situation," Seattle manager Don Wakamatsu said. "We put some better at-bats together today."	Gutierrez did his part, going 3 for 5, while Wilson and Suzuki each had a pair of hits.	"It was very important, this victory," Gutierrez said. "We've been having a tough time scoring runs. So it was very special that we won. We've got to keep doing it and do it better."	Mark Lowe (1-1) walked two in a scoreless eighth, and David Aardsma worked the ninth for his second save.	The late-inning meltdown spoiled Nelson Cruz's fourth homer in five games and six strong innings from Matt Harrison.	Cruz homered off Seattle starter Felix Hernandez, lining a 3-1 pitch into the left field seats to give Texas a 3-1 lead in the fifth. Cruz is 8 for 18 and came into the game tied for the AL lead with seven RBIs.	"It's a tough thing; it should have been a win today," Cruz said. "It's really disappointing, but that's baseball. Anything can happen."	Harrison, meanwhile, settled down after a shaky start. The left-hander struck out four and scattered six hits, allowing an earned run in his first start since last June. He retired the final eight batters he faced before giving way to Dustin Nippert.	Hernandez allowed three runs -- two earned -- and seven hits with five strikeouts and a walk over seven innings.	Six of the first 12 batters Harrison faced reached base. But Harrison, coming off season-ending surgery last June for thoracic outlet syndrome, retired Suzuki on a swinging bunt back to the mound with runners at second and third in the second and then struck out Suzuki to end the fourth with runners at first and second.	Game notes	 Washington said C Matt Treanor will get his first start for the Rangers on Sunday. Treanor, acquired in a trade with Milwaukee at the end of spring training, became the No. 2 catcher behind Teagarden when Jarrod Saltalamacchia went on the 15-day DL earlier this week. ... Texas 2B Ian Kinsler took another step in his rehab from a sprained right ankle on Saturday when he worked on his defense with infield coach Dave Anderson. Kinsler missed the last three weeks of spring training and opened the season on the 15-day DL. There is no timetable for his return. ... Manager Don Wakamatsu said LHP Cliff Lee will throw a 45-pitch bullpen session on Sunday in his recovery from a strained abdominal muscle.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- CC Sabathia was going to lose his no-hit bid one way or another.	Former batterymate Kelly Shoppach made Yankees manager Joe Girardi's decision a whole lot simpler, lining a sharp single to left with two outs in the eighth inning of New York's 10-0 win over the Tampa Bay Rays on Saturday.	"It makes it easy now, but there would have been fighting out there on the mound," Sabathia said after learning Girardi planned to remove him regardless of what Shoppach did because of a high pitch count (111).	"I felt good, but I understand where he's coming from at the same time, too. It's the second start of the year," Sabathia added. "It would have been a good discussion."	With a large contingent of Yankee fans among the Tropicana Field crowd of 29,892 chanting "Let's go, CC!" Shoppach's hit on a 1-0 pitch fell cleanly in front of left fielder Brett Gardner and ended the closest call of the big lefty's career.	There was no visible reaction from the Yankees ace, although Sabathia (1-0) and his former teammate in Cleveland exchanged glances after Shoppach reached first base.	"Typical looks," Shoppach said. "You can read faces."	Girardi immediately bounced out of the dugout to remove Sabathia, who walked two and struck out five. The left-hander threw 69 of his 111 pitches for strikes and benefited from spectacular defensive plays by Mark Teixeira, Alex Rodriguez and Robinson Cano.	But Girardi said he had no intentions of allowing Sabathia to pitch beyond Shoppach, who settled into the batter's box thinking "OK. It's gotta be me," to end the bid for what would have been the first Yankees no-hitter since David Cone's perfect game in 1999, caught by Girardi.	"Watching that pitch count go up and up and up, that was what was on my mind the most. Shoppach was his last hitter no matter what," Girardi said. "He did not know that going out. I told him when he came out. It's not something you want to do, but you have to think big picture."	"The big picture was the month of October. You have to think ahead. You can't be short- sighted," Girardi continued. "I would have loved to see him walk out with no hits and eight innings. I would have loved to see it, but it didn't happen. It made it real easy to go get him."	David Robertson pitched the final 1 1/3 innings to complete a combined two-hitter. Ben Zobrist doubled off the reliever with two outs in the ninth.	Sabathia also took a no-hitter into the eighth inning for Cleveland on April 7, 2002, at Detroit, with Randall Simon breaking up that bid with a leadoff single. The left-hander pitched a one-hitter for Milwaukee at Pittsburgh on Aug. 31, 2008 -- the only hit coming on Andy LaRoche's check-swing dribbler back to the pitcher in the fifth inning.	"That's as good as I've seen him in a long time," said Shoppach, one of the catchers Sabathia worked with when he was with the Indians.	"I thought it was beautiful," Shoppach added of the single on his friend's final pitch. "Just the history. I thought if anybody was to do it, it was supposed to be me. I know he probably thinks the opposite."	Cano hit a two-run homer off Wade Davis (0-1) in the fourth inning, and the Yankees scored two more in the fifth on Derek Jeter's run-scoring single and Teixeira's RBI double, which snapped an 0 for 17 skid, the longest hitless streak to begin a season in the slugger's career.	Teixeira also stretched out to make a diving catch on Jason Bartlett's low liner to keep the no-hit bid alive in the sixth. It was A-Rod's turn to shine in the seventh, scrambling to his feet after making a diving stop on B.J. Upton's hard grounder past third base and making the long throw to Teixeira at first.	"You want to see it preserved as long as possible, even if it takes two pitchers. Our defense was great behind him," Girardi said. "Alex had all kinds of plays. That's what you need when you're going through what CC was going through. You have to have some great defense."	Sabathia walked Evan Longoria leading off the fifth and Carl Crawford starting the seventh, both on 3-2 pitches. Longoria eventually was stranded at third base, and the Rays left another runner in scoring position when Zobrist stole second after reaching on a fielder's choice in the seventh.	Sabathia made a nice play on a comebacker from Crawford in the fourth, then slowed down Willy Aybar's high bouncer with his pitching hand in the eighth, deflecting the ball toward second baseman Cano, who easily threw the runner out.	Two batters later, Shoppach -- a .241 career hitter who had grounded to Rodriguez in the third and flied to Gardner in the sixth -- jumped on a fastball as it crossed the middle of the plate.	"As soon as it left the bat, I saw how it was floating out there. I knew it was going to be a hit," said Sabathia, who then acknowledged his buddy.	"I didn't say anything. I just looked at him, he looked at me," Sabathia added. "We kind of gave each other a smile, so it's pretty cool."	Game notes	 Davis allowed four runs and seven hits in six innings. He walked four and struck out three for Tampa Bay. ... Yankees fifth starter Phil Hughes pitched six innings in an extended spring training intrasquad game in Tampa. ... Rays RHP Jeff Niemann felt fine after playing catch and a decision on whether he'll make his next scheduled start will be made after he throws on the side Sunday. He left his first start of the season against Baltimore after being hit in the right shoulder by a line drive.

BALTIMORE -- In his debut with the Toronto Blue Jays, Dana Eveland decided to ignore his curveball and rely solely on the whim of catcher Jose Molina.	The result was unexpected, by all accounts.	"It was actually one of the weirdest games I've ever pitched in my entire life," said Eveland, whose brilliant performance Saturday night carried the Blue Jays to a 3-0 victory over the Baltimore Orioles.	Eveland (1-0) allowed five hits in 7 1/3 innings, walking two and striking out two. The left-hander permitted only two runners to get past second base and retired 13 of the final 15 batters he faced.	"It was fastball-changeup all day," Eveland said. "I've been a guy my whole entire career where I'll [throw] 40 percent breaking balls in a game."	And how many did he attempt against the Orioles?	"Five or six," Eveland said.	That's because Molina quickly realized that Baltimore was having trouble getting good wood on Eveland's changeup.	"He knew what was going on," Eveland said. "I kind of just went with him. I think I shook him [off] once the whole game."	Said Molina: "When you have a team that is chasing a pitch you just keep trying to go with it until they show you that they can make that adjustment. Tonight the Orioles did not make that adjustment, and that's why we took advantage of it."	Baltimore's Adam Jones, who went 0 for 4, said, "When Molina is behind the plate, he's unpredictable. He calls a good game. He did it again."	Molina did more than shine behind the plate. The veteran backup catcher -- and Toronto's No. 9 hitter -- also drove in two runs to give Eveland all the offensive support he needed.	Edwin Encarnacion had two hits and scored twice for the Blue Jays, who have won four straight. Toronto is already 2-0 at Camden Yards after going 1-8 in 2009.	Eveland was 2-4 with a 7.16 ERA last year with Oakland, which sent him to Toronto in February for cash.	"He pitched well in spring training so I'm not surprised," Blue Jays manager Cito Gaston said. "He kept them off balance, changed speeds real well, hit the outside part of the plate. And Molina called a great game."	Scott Downs got an inning-ending, double-play grounder in the eighth, and Jason Frasor got three outs for his third save.	Eveland outpitched Baltimore starter David Hernandez (0-1), who gave up two runs and six hits in six innings. The Orioles have lost Hernandez's last 10 starts since Aug. 11, 2009.	"Hernandez pitched well, but their guy pitched better. That's it," Baltimore manager Dave Trembley said. "We didn't score any runs, had limited opportunities, needed a couple of hits and didn't get them.	"But I'll take the way Hernandez pitched. We'll win some games if he pitches like that."	It was Baltimore's first game of the season that was not decided by one run. The Orioles are 1-4 despite scoring only five fewer runs than the opposition.	"We've played competitive baseball. The games are close," Trembley said. "We haven't gotten big hits when we needed them."	Baltimore stranded runners at second and third in the second inning, and the Blue Jays failed to score in the third after putting runners on the corners with one out.	In the Toronto fourth, Encarnacion snapped a 1-for-13 skid with a two-out single and took third on a double by Alex Gonzalez. After an intentional walk to Travis Snider loaded the bases, Hernandez hit Molina with a pitch to force in a run.	The Blue Jays made it 2-0 in the sixth. A double by Encarnacion and a two-out intentional walk to Snider preceded an RBI single by Molina.	Adam Lind doubled home a run in the ninth.	Game notes	 Orioles 2B Brian Roberts (abdominal sprain) did not play and expects to be sidelined for the next several days. He was replaced by Julio Lugo, who had two hits. ... Blue Jays 2B Aaron Hill missed a third straight game with a sore right hamstring. Asked to project Hill's return, Gaston said, "I'm thinking maybe Monday -- if we're lucky." ... Jones received his 2009 Gold Glove before the game, then extended his hitting slump to 1 for 17. ... Orioles RF Nick Markakis walked twice and has eight BBs in five games.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

HOUSTON -- No matter who steps to the plate for the Philadelphia Phillies these days, something good seems likely to happen.	Ryan Howard, Shane Victorino and Jayson Werth drove in three runs apiece, and the Phillies' offense rolled again Saturday night in a 9-6 win over Houston that sent the Astros to their worst start in 27 years.	The Phillies finished with 11 hits and have reached double digits in their first five games for the first time since 1926. Philadelphia leads the majors with 41 runs and is hitting .337.	"It just seems like every time you come up, there's a guy in scoring position," said Howard, who has opened the season with a five-game hitting streak. "It's contagious."	Jamie Moyer (1-0), baseball's oldest player at 47, became the sixth-oldest pitcher to appear in a game and the eighth-oldest to start one in four decades. He allowed five runs and nine hits in six innings.	Moyer knows the Phillies can't keep up this kind of offensive production forever. He tried to focus on his own job, even after his team staked him to a 4-0 lead by the third inning.	"I don't really try to go out and think about what my offense is going to do," said Moyer, who leads active pitchers with 259 career wins. "I think I've got a big enough chore to try to pitch and pitch effectively. If I can go out and put zeros up, it doesn't put as much emphasis on them having to score seven, eight, nine runs a game."	Jason Michaels and Hunter Pence homered off Moyer for the Astros, who are 0-5 for the first time since the 1983 team lost its first nine games. Houston snapped a streak of 13 scoreless innings, then was shut out in five straight on Saturday night before Michaels drove in a run in the ninth.	But the Astros were blanked in two of their first four games, so manager Brad Mills saw progress from his sputtering offense.	"It was a big step forward," he said. "It was nice to see them put together some solid at-bats again and start scoring some runs."	Moyer left with the Phillies down 5-4, but they regained the lead in the seventh against Brandon Lyon (0-1).	Chase Utley drew a two-out walk before Howard hammered a 2-1 pitch off the facade in left-center for his third homer of the season. Three straight singles by Werth, Raul Ibanez and Victorino made it 7-5.	The way the bats are working for Philly, no deficit seems too big to overcome.	"We know we can score runs, we know we can come back," manager Charlie Manuel said. "We just play the whole game out. As long as we do that, we'll be OK."	Werth singled and Victorino homered in the ninth off Astros closer Matt Lindstrom. Houston scored its last run in the ninth off Ryan Madson.	Howard led off the second inning with a triple to left off Felipe Paulino. The ball banged off the metal scoreboard and ricocheted off left fielder Carlos Lee's shoulder. Athletic trainer Nate Lucero and manager Brad Mills jogged out to check on Lee, but he stayed in the game.	Werth followed with a sacrifice fly to deep center for a 1-0 lead.	The Phillies loaded the bases in the third, and Paulino walked in a run when he missed high and away with a 3-2 pitch to Howard. Werth then lined a two-run double to the left-field corner, prompting early boos from the home crowd.	Moyer retired his first eight batters before Paulino doubled off the right-field wall, his second career hit.	Michaels drove Moyer's next pitch into the left-field seats, the Astros' first home run of the season. Jeff Keppinger walked before Pence tied it 4-all with a homer to left.	The Astros loaded the bases and took their first lead of the season when Placido Polanco bobbled Tommy Manzella's sharp grounder to third, allowing Lee to score on the infield single.	Game notes	 Phillies closer Brad Lidge allowed four runs and three hits for Class-A Clearwater against Dunedin, his first rehab outing since elbow surgery. Lidge threw 20 pitches and retired only two batters. Left-hander J.C. Romero, also coming off elbow surgery, threw a scoreless inning in the same game with two strikeouts. ... The Astros and Phillies wore throwback uniforms commemorating the first regular-season game played at the Houston Astrodome, on April 12, 1965. Philadelphia won that one 2-0. ... All-Star slugger Lance Berkman will skip Houston's first road trip to get more treatment on his injured left knee. The team said Berkman will work with physical therapist Matt Holland in Houston while the Astros visit St. Louis and Chicago next week. Berkman had arthroscopic surgery on March 13 and has been on the disabled list since March 31.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.
