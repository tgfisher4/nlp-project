BALTIMORE -- As the strikeouts mounted and his hitless streak endured, Jose Bautista was not concerned because the Toronto Blue Jays were winning anyway.	Manager John Gibbons wasn't worried, either, because he figured it was only a matter of time before the slugger got on track.	Bautista ended an early-season slump by going 3 for 3 and scoring four runs as Toronto ruined the Baltimore Orioles' home opener with a 12-5 victory Friday.	Josh Donaldson and Dioner Navarro each drove in three runs for the Blue Jays, who took control with a four-run first inning and led 10-1 in the fourth.	After going 0 for 12 with eight strikeouts during Toronto's opening three-game series in New York, Bautista got a hit in each of his first three at-bats and added a walk before leaving with leg cramps. He drove in two runs and tied his career high in runs scored as the Blue Jays improved to 3-1.	"Slow start individually doesn't matter when your team is winning games," Bautista said. "If we sustain that I'll be happy."	Toronto manager John Gibbons knew Bautista -- a five-time All-Star -- wouldn't be struggling for long.	"He's the last guy you got to worry about," Gibbons said. "Early in the year they were pitching him tough, but I thought he was too aggressive. Today I thought he did a better job of getting a pitch to hit."	Mark Buehrle (1-0) allowed one run and eight hits in six innings to earn his 200th career win.	"It's going to mean more when I get home, retired and sit on the couch and look back," Buehrle said. "It's a round number. Obviously been around a while, stayed healthy, made some starts."	Toronto finished with 16 hits, half of them doubles -- including two by Dalton Pompey. After playing the spoiler's role at Yankee Stadium for New York's home opener Monday, the Blue Jays pulled off an encore at Camden Yards.	"We got one more," Gibbons said. "Maybe we can do it right at our place."	Adam Jones homered, had a career-high tying four hits and drove in two runs for the Orioles, now 41-21 in home openers since coming to Baltimore from St. Louis in 1954.	Bud Norris (0-1) allowed eight runs and seven hits in three-plus innings. He was 4-0 lifetime against Toronto and had won nine straight decisions against AL East foes.	"Frustrating. It's not what I envisioned," Norris said. "It's tough to do that here at home and in front of my team. I'll take that one on me, for sure."	After winning two of three on the road against Tampa Bay, Baltimore returned home for its first game at Camden Yards since October.	The pregame festivities included a video montage of the Orioles' run to the 2014 AL Championship Series, plenty of fireworks and Jones and J.J. Hardy receiving their Gold Glove Awards. Also, Hall of Fame pitcher Jim Palmer threw out the ceremonial first pitch to 1983 World Series MVP Rick Dempsey.	Under an overcast sky and with rain in the forecast, Norris began the game with a first-pitch strike that drew a huge cheer. Not long after that, Toronto sucked much of the enthusiasm from the sellout crowd of 45,936.	The first-inning uprising began with three straight hits, including an RBI single by Bautista. Edwin Encarnacion added a sacrifice fly and Dioner Navarro doubled in two runs.	Jones connected in the bottom half to make it 4-1, but in the third Bautista doubled and scored on a fly ball.	Toronto batted around in a five-run fourth. Pompey and Donaldson each hit two-run doubles and Bautista singled in a run.	DOUBLE FIGURES	Blue Jays: The eight doubles was Toronto's most since July 20, 2010, at Kansas City.	Orioles: It was the third time in club history that Orioles allowed at least 10 runs in a home opener. They yielded 12 to Milwaukee in 1988 and 13 to the Yankees in 1959.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: OF Michael Saunders (left knee surgery) won't be rushed back from a rehabilitation assignment that began with an 0-for-3 performance Thursday with Class A Dunedin. "You want him to get plenty of at-bats," Gibbons said.	Orioles: LHP Wesley Wright has a sore trapezius that could put him on the DL. "It's one of those things that's been kind of bothering me a little bit the last couple days and it got to a point where it wasn't going away," he said after the game.	ON DECK	Blue Jays: RH Aaron Sanchez will make his first major league start Saturday night.	Orioles: RH Ubaldo Jimenez returns to the rotation after struggling in 2014, going 6-9 with a 4.81 ERA.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- Jed Lowrie and Colby Rasmus homered for the Houston Astros, who beat the injury-plagued Rangers 5-1 on Friday to spoil the home debut of new Texas manager Jeff Banister.	Rangers starter Derek Holland (0-1) left after only one inning because of tightness in left shoulder, and outfielders Shin-Soo Choo and Ryan Rua also made early exits because of injuries.	Collin McHugh (1-0), who was 7-0 with a 1.77 ERA his final 10 starts as a rookie last season, struck out four and allowed one run over six innings.	Lowrie hit a solo homer in the first off Holland. Rasmus had a two-run shot in the ninth of closer Neftali Feliz pitching in a non-save situation.	No. 9 hitter Jake Marisnick had three of Houston's 10 hits and drove in two runs. The Astros totaled only three runs and eight hits in their season-opening, three-game series against Cleveland.	The Rangers said Holland felt the tightness in the back of his shoulder on the last pitch he threw during warmups. The team said the problem was in a different area than the shoulder soreness that slowed him early this spring after missing most of last season recovering from left knee surgery.	Anthony Bass took over then the second, and allowed one run in five innings. The right-hander had a defensive gem in the fifth when he had a diving backhanded stab to catch Robbie Grossman's popped-up bunt and turned that into a double play.	Right fielder Choo left after two innings because of spasms in his upper back, and Rua departed after five innings with a sprained right ankle sustained running into the left field corner chasing a ball.	Jose Altuve, the reigning major batting champion off to a 2-for-16 start this season, had a single on the first pitch of the game. But he was picked off second base by Holland just before Lowrie's second homer of the season. Lowrie's ninth-inning home run a day earlier broke a combined no-hit bid by Cleveland.	Marisnick had an RBI double in the fifth, and an RBI single two innings later after Grossman doubled.	Adrian Beltre had a double in the sixth and scored on a grounder by Delino DeShields, who had replaced Rua.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: RHP Brad Peacock, who is rehabbing after hip surgery, allowed no hits in 4 2/3 innings in a start for Triple-A Fresno. He walked five batters and hit another one. "It's good that he was hard to hit," Houston manager A.J. Hinch said. ... RHP Josh Fields (right groin) threw live BP in Kissimmee, Florida, and next will pitch for Fresno, likely this weekend.	Rangers: RHP Tanner Scheppers (right ankle) struck out all three batters he faced for Double-A Frisco. The next step is pitching in consecutive games, which is the plan Saturday and Sunday.	UP NEXT	Astros: RHP Roberto Hernandez, who went to spring training on a minor league deal after pitching last year for Philadelphia and the Los Angeles Dodgers, makes his Houston debut. The 2010 AL All-Star with Cleveland was 3-0 in his five spring training games to earn a rotation spot.	Rangers: Yovani Gallardo is from Fort Worth, and was acquired by Texas in January. The right-hander, who lost the season opener at Oakland, makes his home debut for the Rangers.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

CHICAGO -- The Minnesota Twins picked up their first win under Paul Molitor. Then they had some fun with their first-year manager.	Tommy Milone pitched two-hit ball into the eighth inning, and Minnesota beat the White Sox 6-0 Friday in Chicago's home opener.	The Twins celebrated by dousing their manager with beer and showering him with praise.	"(Molitor's) a guy that has a good relationship with everybody," Brian Dozier said. "You want to get the first one under your belt -- for him. It's big."	Joe Mauer reached base four times, with an RBI single and three walks. Eduardo Escobar doubled and scored twice hours after his fiancee gave birth to a boy, and Dozier homered.	The Twins got some relief after getting knocked around in a three-game sweep at Detroit, while the White Sox (0-4) matched their worst start since 1995.	"If this happens in the middle of the season sometime, nobody's making as big deal about it," third baseman Gordon Beckham said. "Now that we're starting the season like this it's made out to be a lot bigger than it is. But I can promise you that we don't feel that in the clubhouse."	Milone (1-0) yielded a bunt single to Micah Johnson in the third and retired the next 16 batters before Tyler Flowers chased him with a two-out double in the eighth. He struck out seven and walked two.	"If we're gonna try to reverse our trend here in a little bit, it's gonna start with the guys we put on the mound to start ballgames," Molitor said. "And Tommy was great."	Brian Duensing retired Johnson on a fly to left to end the eighth and worked the ninth for his first save.	The game ended with Adam Eaton, who led off the inning with a double, getting thrown out trying to score on a pop fly by Jose Abreu to the shortstop Escobar in shallow left. The ball came loose after Eaton got tangled with Kurt Suzuki, but the catcher held on long enough.	After going scoreless through the first 24 1/3 innings and getting pounded a combined 22-1 in the Tigers series, the Twins grabbed a 1-0 lead in the first when Mauer drove in Escobar with a single. Escobar also led off the fifth with a double and scored from third on a wild pitch by Hector Noesi (0-1) with the bases loaded.	Dozier made it 3-0 in the sixth with a drive to left off Matt Albers for his first homer after hitting a career-high 23 last year. Jordan Schafer capped a three-run eighth by driving in two with a bloop single off Zach Putnam.	Noesi lasted 4 2/3 innings for Chicago, allowing two runs and four hits. He struck out six but struggled with his control, walking six, throwing two wild pitches and hitting a batter.	The White Sox, who were swept by defending AL champion Kansas City in their opening series, finished with three hits.	MINNIE TRIBUTE	White Sox shortstop Alexei Ramirez honored the late Minnie Minoso by wearing a No. 9 jersey with "Minoso" on the back.	Ramirez came up with the idea for honoring his fellow Cuban during spring training. Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf gave his approval, as did the Minoso family.	"My relation with Minnie was beyond the field," Ramirez said through an interpreter.	The White Sox also showed a video tribute to Minoso during the game.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Twins: RHP Ricky Nolasco is headed to the 15-day disabled list because of inflammation in his pitching elbow. Molitor said the move likely will be made Saturday, with Trevor May getting called up from Triple-A Rochester. May will start Monday's home opener against Kansas City.	White Sox: The White Sox hope ace Chris Sale goes about six innings Sunday when he makes his first start of the season. The left-hander broke a bone in his right foot in late February.	UP NEXT	RHP Jeff Samardzija (0-1, 7.50 ERA) makes his first home start for the White Sox, while RHP Mike Pelfrey pitches for Minnesota.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CLEVELAND -- Alfredo Simon took a shutout into the sixth in his debut for Detroit and Nick Castellanos hit a two-run homer as the Tigers won their fourth straight, 8-4 over Cleveland on Friday to spoil the Indians' home opener in their remodeled ballpark.	Simon (1-0) allowed three runs and seven hits in 5 1/3 innings. The right-hander came over in an offseason trade from Cincinnati and got his first taste of what it's like to pitch for one of baseball's best lineups.	Castellanos homered in the fifth off Zach McAllister (0-1), tagged for a career-high 13 hits.	Carlos Santana had two RBIs for Cleveland, which put the tying run on deck in the ninth before Joakim Soria struck out Michael Bourn with two on for his first save.	Miguel Cabrera and Victor Martinez each had three hits and an RBI for the Tigers, who have outscored their opponents 30-5 to open the season.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

DENVER -- The Colorado Rockies tied their best start in franchise history, beating the Chicago Cubs 5-1 Friday behind Troy Tulowitzki's two-run double and Justin Morneau's solo homer.	The Rockies, off to their first 4-0 start since 1995, got another stellar performance from their bullpen in relief of a shaky Tyler Matzek.	Right-hander Christian Bergman (1-0) picked up the win with a perfect fifth inning, and five Colorado relievers combined to allow just one hit -- a bunt single by Anthony Rizzo with the shift on -- in five innings.	Matzek became the first Rockies starting pitcher ever to bat eighth. With fellow lefty Travis Wood (0-1) also batting eighth, this marked the first game that both starting pitchers batted in that spot since St. Louis' Joel Pineiro and Pittsburgh's Ian Snell did it on July 13, 2008, according to STATS.	Both managers said the unconventional strategy allows for a more potent No. 2 hitter, and Tulowitzki proved the point with a two-run double down the left-field line off Wood that broke a 1-1 tie in the fifth.	Matzek was wild all day -- just 40 strikes in 84 pitches -- and he left after allowing a walk and a single to start the fifth. He gave up an earned run on Matt Szczur's sacrifice fly in the third, on four hits, walked three, plunked Rizzo twice and threw a wild pitch.	Bergman got Starlin Castro to ground into a double play and Mike Olt to ground out to third.	Matzek scored Colorado's first run, doubling with two outs in the second and coming around on D.J. LeMahieu's single.	Morneau greeted right-hander Brian Schlitter, just called up from Triple-A Iowa, with his first homer leading off the sixth for his 1,500th hit, and Corey Dickerson added a run-scoring single to make it 5-1.	Broncos GM John Elway tweeted a photo from behind the Rockies' dugout and added, "The former baseball player in me always looks forward to opening day."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: Reliever RHP Justin Grimm landed on the 15-day DL with swelling in his right forearm and was replaced by RHP Brian Schlitter.	Rockies: LHJ Jorge De La Rosa said he's probably going to have to deal with his sore left groin all season. He threw 57 pitches in a rehab start at Triple-A Albuquerque on Thursday night and will throw a bullpen session Saturday at Coors Field.	UP NEXT	Cubs: RHP Jason Hammel (0-0, 0.00) makes his first start against his former team Saturday. He pitched for the Rockies from 2009-11.	Rockies: RHP Kyle Kendrick (1-0, 0.00) makes his home debut for the Rockies on Saturday. Signed as a free agent in the offseason, Kendrick has a 1-1 record and 5.26 ERA at Coors Field.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

NEW YORK -- The first game of the season between the Red Sox and Yankees was one to remember -- for anyone still awake at the end.	In the latest classic matchup of their long and illustrious rivalry, Boston finally outlasted New York 6-5 in 19 innings early Saturday when the game-ending double play was turned at 2:13 a.m.	After squandering leads in the ninth, 16th and 18th, Boston at last went ahead for good on a sacrifice fly by Mookie Betts. Xander Bogaerts scored the decisive run after reaching on his fourth hit in extra innings.	"It's a testament to the will and the resiliency of this team," Red Sox manager John Farrell said.	Chase Headley and Mark Teixeira, who turned 35 when the clock struck midnight, hit tying home runs for the Yankees during an early-season epic delayed 16 minutes by a power outage in the 12th. That's why the official time of game was 6 hours, 49 minutes -- even though it took more than 7 hours to complete.	The teams combined for 138 at-bats, 32 hits, 28 strikeouts and 627 pitches thrown by 17 pitchers, according to ESPN's Stats and Information.	After the first of 19 meetings this year, the teams get little chance to rest. They're back at it for the middle game of the series Saturday at 1:05 p.m.	"It's one game that seemed like about six, and we'll move on," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.	David Ortiz hit a solo homer for Boston to break a 3-all deadlock in the 16th. But then Teixeira, batting from the right side against right-handed knuckleballer Steven Wright, led off the bottom half with a no-doubt drive to left field.	And on it went before a few thousand scattered fans left from the crowd of 41,292.	Pablo Sandoval put the Red Sox back in front with an RBI single in the 18th only to see Brian McCann and Carlos Beltran hit doubles in the bottom half to tie it again at 5.	Each club went to its last reliever in the 15th during the longest game by time in Red Sox history -- and second-longest for the Yankees. They had a 22-inning victory at Detroit that took 7 hours in 1962.	It was the longest game by innings for New York since a 19-inning win over Minnesota in August 1976.	"It was just a wonderful game. I wish we would have won, but it was a great game," Headley said.	The longest game by innings between the old rivals was a 20-inning victory for New York in the second game of a 1967 doubleheader.	Headley's solo shot off fill-in closer Edward Mujica came with two outs in the bottom of the ninth. Neither team could break through again until Ortiz launched an 0-2 pitch from Esmil Rogers (0-1) to right-center.	Didi Gregorius had a chance to win it for New York in the 16th and 18th, but grounded out with a runner at third to end both innings.	Boston got five innings of relief from Wright (1-0) in a game that featured 17 pitchers who combined to throw 628 pitches.	"I looked around the bullpen and I was the only one left. That's my role and I like that role," Wright said.	The Red Sox stranded 20 runners, but came through one last time in the 19th.	Bogaerts singled, stole second and went to third on a passed ball by backup catcher John Ryan Murphy, who had just replaced McCann. Betts delivered a sac fly to center.	It appeared New York might rally yet again in the bottom half when Jacoby Ellsbury led off with a single. Brett Gardner flied out, and Garrett Jones hit a low liner toward the middle. Bogaerts short-hopped the ball at shortstop and flipped to second, where Dustin Pedroia leaped in the air for an athletic relay to first.	"Unbelievable," Wright said. "That's a heck of a play, to be able to pull that off at 2:30 in the morning. It's spectacular."	Girardi said Jones, a first baseman and DH who came off the bench in the 11th for his Yankees debut, would have pitched the 20th.	Rogers, who threw 81 pitches after making 35 the previous night, said he would have pushed to stay in the game.	"It feels worse than one loss, but thank goodness it's only one," Gardner said.	The lights dimmed as Boston reliever Tommy Layne threw the first pitch in the bottom of the 12th to Beltran. Fans groaned and umpires huddled with both managers before going underneath the stands to get information.	It appeared nine or 10 banks of lights went out, many of them behind home plate. After both teams left the field to boos, the lights came back on and play resumed.	The Yankees said they believe there was a power surge throughout the building. The team turned on additional light banks that are normally off above the foul poles as electricians rebooted the bulbs that went dark.	One of several newcomers to an old rivalry, Sandoval also had an RBI single for the Red Sox his first time up. And for the first time in two decades, Derek Jeter wasn't a member of the Yankees when they took on Boston.	"The game doesn't wait for anyone," Farrell said beforehand. "We're looking forward to the next chapter."	SEEN THAT BEFORE	It was Ortiz's first home run of the year and his 50th against the Yankees, including playoff games.	BACK IN THE SADDLE	Alex Rodriguez batted third for New York. He hit an RBI single and a double, and struck out three times.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: Boston closer Koji Uehara (strained left hamstring) is slated to pitch an inning for Class A Greenville in a rehab assignment Saturday night.	Yankees: McCann was shaken up in the ninth when a foul ball hit the top of his right kneecap, but he remained in the game for another nine innings.	UP NEXT	Red Sox: RHP Joe Kelly (strained biceps) will come off the DL to start Saturday afternoon.	Yankees: RHP Adam Warren, primarily a reliever the last two seasons, is scheduled to make his fourth major league start after winning the final rotation spot during spring training. Warren was exclusively a starter in the minors.	Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PHILADELPHIA --  Trying to be too fine, Gio Gonzalez ended up having a wild seventh inning.	Cesar Hernandez had a go-ahead, two-run single in a four-run seventh and Freddy Galvis had three hits and an RBI, leading the Philadelphia Phillies to a 4-1 victory over the Washington Nationals on Friday night.	Gonzalez (0-1) gave up three runs on five hits in 6 1/3 innings with four strikeouts and four walks. It was a disappointing debut for the left-hander, whose 3.57 ERA last year was his worst since 2009. He missed a month due to a left shoulder injury but was feeling good entering this season and pitched well in spring training.	Gonzalez breezed into the seventh, getting Jeff Francoeur to fly out to open the inning before everything unraveled.	Manager Matt Williams visited the lefty after consecutive walks put runners on first and second but left him in. Gonzalez was chased after he hit Andres Blanco to load the bases.	"I was trying to be too perfect," Gonzalez said.	Hernandez drilled Xavier Cedeno's first pitch into right field for two runs, with slow-footed Cameron Rupp sliding home after Bryce Harper's throw from right field went slightly up the third-base line. Cedeno was lifted after hitting Ben Revere. Galvis singled in a run, and Chase Utley had a sacrifice fly.	It was an unexpected turn of events, as Gonzalez looked in total control.	"He just lost the strike zone," Williams said. "Unless we had to get him out of there, we wanted to give him a shot."	Michael Taylor homered for the Nationals, the preseason favorites in the NL East who have lost three of four to open the year while scoring just seven runs.	It was the second career homer for Taylor and his first leadoff shot as he continues to fill in for Denard Span in center field while Span rehabs after core muscle surgery. But Taylor wasn't in a celebratory mood.	"It was nice to get on the board early, but it was only one run," he said. "We needed more than that tonight."	Luis Garcia (1-0) pitched a scoreless seventh inning in relief of Jerome Williams. Williams settled down after allowing Taylor's leadoff homer to yield one run and five hits with six strikeouts and a walk in six innings.	"It felt good get back to where it needed to be, down in the zone -- except for the homer," he said.	Jonathon Papelbon, two days after saying he doesn't "feel much like a Phillie," pitched a 1-2-3 ninth for his second save in as many chances. Papelbon is five saves away from becoming Philadelphia's all-time saves leader.	LONG SEASON?	Once regularly sold out, Citizens Bank Park isn't expected to have its usual, raucous atmosphere this season. The Phillies announced a crowd of 19,047, which is the lowest in the 12-year history of the park.	WHAT A CATCH	The best catch of the night was made by a Phillies vendor. Grady Sizemore fouled a ball back in the seventh inning and it caromed off the facade between the first and second deck and down to the lower level. The vendor snared the ball with one hand while steadying two beers with the other, drawing loud cheers from the Phillies fans.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: OF Jayson Werth was scheduled to make a rehab start at Class-A Potomac for the second straight day, but the game was rained out. Werth, who had offseason shoulder surgery, went 0 for 2 with a walk at Potomac on Thursday. He is expected to play for Potomac on Saturday and could return to the Nationals lineup on Monday.	Phillies: RHP Chad Billingsley struggled during a rehab start at Triple-A Lehigh Valley on Friday, allowing three runs on four hits in 3 1/3 innings. Two of the hits were homers. Billingsley is attempting to come back after two right elbow operations limited him to 12 innings in 2013 and cost him all of last year. In eight seasons with the Dodgers, Billingsley was 81-61 with a 3.65 ERA. He could rejoin Philadelphia's rotation later this month.	UP NEXT	Nationals: RHP Doug Fister makes his season debut on Saturday against Philadelphia after a career-best season last year when he went 16-6 with a 2.41 ERA in 25 starts. Fister is 2-2 with a 2.60 ERA in four career starts against the Phillies.	Phillies: LHP Cole Hamels (0-1, 7.20) looks to regain his winning form against the Nationals when he takes the hill on Saturday. The Phillies ace dominated Washington prior to last season, going 15-6 with a 2.58 ERA in 28 starts. But Hamels was 0-2 in four starts against the Nationals last year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CINCINNATI --  With Joey Votto playing like an MVP again, the Cincinnati Reds have stayed unbeaten.	Votto hit a pair of two-run homers -- the strongest indication yet that he's fully back in form -- and Todd Frazier had a tiebreaking sacrifice fly on Friday night, keeping the Cincinnati Reds undefeated with a 5-4 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals.	The Reds are 4-0 for the first time since 2011, when they won their first five games. They've won each game in their final at-bat.	Votto homered off John Lackey in each of his first two at-bats. Frazier's sacrifice fly in the eighth off Jordan Walden (0-1) drove in Billy Hamilton and marked the second time this week that he's knocked in the deciding run.	J.J. Hoover (2-0) escaped a threat in the eighth. Aroldis Chapman gave up a hit and fanned two in the ninth for his second save.	Votto hit only six homers last season -- the last one on May 10 -- and didn't play after July 5 because of strained muscles above his left knee. He showed up for spring training feeling strong and has played to his 2010 National League MVP form so far.	"He was terrific," manager Bryan Price said. "He's doing a lot of things really well. It's nice to have him back with his athleticism."	He had his first multihomer game since May 13, 2012, and the 10th of his career. In four games, Votto is 7 for 17 with three homers and eight RBIs.	Votto had two singles in the season opener, a game-ending RBI single in the 11th inning of the second game, and a two-run homer on Thursday as the Reds swept the Pittsburgh Pirates.	"It's early. It'll level off," Votto said. "I didn't have a great spring, but I felt very good. Physically, I was in a good frame which usually means I'm going to have a good year."	Jason Marquis made his first start in the majors since July 19, 2013 with San Diego. He had Tommy John surgery and made nine appearances in the minors with the Phillies last season as part of his comeback.	The 36-year-old was in line for the win, handing a 4-3 lead to the bullpen in the seventh. Marquis retired 12 in a row after Randal Grichuk's two-run homer.	"I gave up the home run to the No 8 batter there, and I felt like I wasn't doing my job," Marquis said. "Luckily, Joey came through."	The Cardinals put together three singles in the seventh, with Jason Heyward's hit up the middle tying it at 4.	PAYING TRIBUTE	The Reds had a pregame tribute on the videoboard for of Cardinals outfielder Oscar Taveras and his girlfriend, who died in a car crash during the offseason. Also, a tribute to Lauren Hill, the college basketball player who died from a brain tumor on Friday.	BILLY RUNS	Hamilton's steal in the eighth left him 7 for 7 this season. He's the first Reds player to steal a base in each of the first four games since 1988, when Barry Larkin had a steal in each of the first six.. Hamilton is 7 for 7 career off Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: Reserve catcher Tony Cruz went on paternity leave. He's expected back on Monday. Catcher Ed Easley was called up from Triple-A Memphis for his major league debut.	Reds: RHP Homer Bailey is scheduled to make his first rehab start on Sunday at Triple-A Louisville. He's on the DL recovering from surgery on his forearm last September.	UP NEXT	Cardinals: Michael Wacha has made six career appearances against the Reds, going 1-2 with a 2.30 ERA.	Reds: Johnny Cueto makes his second start. He threw seven shutout innings but didn't get the decision in a 5-2 win over the Pirates on Monday. Cueto is 2/3 career against the Cardinals.	---	Follow Joe Kay on Twitter: http://twitter.com/apjoekay	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

MIAMI --  The Miami Marlins took a seven-run lead into the seventh inning, and then had to work a little extra to pull out their first win of the season.	Christian Yelich drove in three runs, including a game-ending RBI single in the bottom of the 10th inning to lift the Marlins to a 10-9 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays on Friday night.	Giancarlo Stanton also had three RBIs and Michael Morse drove in two for the Marlins, who led 8-1 before the Rays scored seven runs in the seventh to tie it.	"Hopefully that's the hardest one we have to get," said pitcher Dan Haren, who made his Marlins debut. "We can win a few a little easier than that. Maybe it's tough getting the first one. Everyone was pressing a little bit and it definitely was good to come out on the right side of that because that would have really stunk not winning that one."	Haren left after six solid innings and the Marlins holding their big lead, but the Rays tied the game.	Stanton gave the Marlins a 9-8 lead with a tiebreaking RBI single in the bottom of the eighth inning.	However, the Rays tied it again. Brandon Guyer led off the ninth with a double against Marlins closer Steve Cishek and scored the tying run when first baseman Morse chose to attempt a game-ending double play on a ground ball by Asdrubal Cabrera. Cabrera beat Adeiny Hechavarria's throw back to first.	In the 10th, Dee Gordon doubled down the right-field line with one out against Brad Boxberger (0-1) before Yelich drove a ground ball through the left side, scoring Gordon without a throw home.	"He was working me away, away, away and there was a hole over there and the ball found it and Dee was able to score," Yelich said.	Bryan Morris (1-0) pitched one inning to earn the victory.	Miami, which beat Tampa Bay for the fifth consecutive time, scored just three runs in its first three games before Friday's outburst to avoid a franchise-worst 0-4 start.	"I just felt that we were going to win that game the whole night," Marlins manager Mike Redmond said. "Despite what happened the attitude was good and guys were battling."	David DeJesus had a three-run triple and Kevin Kiermaier hit his second home run for the Rays.	"I don't know if I've been a part of something like this," Rays manager Kevin Cash said. "It was just amazing. I would think these guys would be feeling pretty good about themselves carrying over to the next game."	Miami scored six runs in the fourth off Erasmo Ramirez to take an 8-1 lead, keyed by a two-run single by Yelich and two-run double by Stanton, who broke out of a 1-for-9 slump to start the season with his first RBIs. Hechavarria and Morse also drove in runs for the Marlins in the inning.	"This is my first game (of the season), but that's no excuse," Ramirez said. "I was supposed to throw strikes and keep the score to 1-1 or maybe 2-1, but I didn't."	Miami relievers David Phelps and Sam Dyson combined to issue three bases-loaded walks in the seventh inning allowing the Rays to pull to 8-4. DeJesus then had a pinch-hit, three-run triple to right-center field off A.J. Ramos and Cabrera singled to score DeJesus to tie it at 8-all.	"I don't know if it was because it was `Zombine Night', but we just couldn't find the zone," Cishek said of the bullpen woes. "But the best part about baseball was that our boys picked us up so it was a great outcome in the end."	The Marlins led 2-0 before Keirmaier's solo home run to right field in the top of the fourth.	Tampa Bay's Steve Geltz allowed one run in two innings in his first career start.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: OF John Jaso (left wrist contusion) was placed on the 15-day disabled list before the game giving the team a major league-high nine players on the DL. OF Mikie Mahtook was recalled from Triple A-Durham in a corresponding move and he made his big-league debut when he pinch-hit for Geltz in the third inning and lined out.	STANTON THROWS OUT ANOTHER RUNNER	Stanton is better known for his bat, but last year's NL Gold Glove finalist also has a strong arm as he showcased in the first when he threw out Cabrera at second base when Cabrera tried stretching a single into a double. It was Stanton's second assist of the season as he doubled up Atlanta's Nick Markakis at first base following a diving catch on Wednesday.	KIERMAIER SHOWING POWER	Kiermaier hit his second home run of the season in his 11th at-bat and came into the game as the only American Leaguer with a double, triple, and homer. The 24-year old hit 10 home runs in 331 at-bats last season.	UP NEXT	Rays: RHP Chris Archer (0-1, 4.76 ERA) gets the start for the Rays as the teams continue their weekend series.	Marlins: RHP Jarred Cosart makes his season debut. Cosart was fined after an MLB investigation earlier this month for gambling on sports. However, MLB ruled that Cosart did not gamble on baseball.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ATLANTA -- Jace Peterson says there's more than one way to move a runner over.	He proved as much against Mets third baseman David Wright.	"I'm thinking I've got to get to third somehow and when he has to come up on the ball and I know I can get around him, I'm going to try to take it," Peterson said. "I was fortunate to get by him. It worked out good."	Phil Gosselin had a tiebreaking two-run single in the eighth inning, Cameron Maybin homered and the Atlanta Braves won their home opener with a 5-3 victory over the sloppy New York Mets on Friday night.	Atlanta recovered after starting pitcher Eric Stults blew a three-run lead in a game delayed more than an hour by rain at the start.	The Braves, despite a major roster overhaul that pointed to a rebuilding year in Atlanta, are 4-0 to begin a season for the first time since they were 7-0 in 1994.	Chris Johnson led off the eighth with a double off Rafael Montero (0-1), the fourth New York pitcher, and was replaced by pinch-runner Peterson.	As Wright charged toward the infield grass to pick up Andrelton Simmons' grounder, Peterson was able to run behind Wright, avoid his tag attempt and safely reach third.	Simmons made it to second when nobody covered the bag, and both runners scored on Gosselin's single to make it 5-3.	Wright blamed himself for not ignoring Peterson and concentrating instead on throwing out Simmons at first.	"You have a split second to make a decision," Wright said, "and it turned out to be the incorrect one."	Jim Johnson (1-0) gave up one hit and struck out the side in the eighth.	Jason Grilli earned his third save.	Montero, who got the last out of the seventh and was chased by Gosselin's hit, allowed two hits, two runs, one walk and struck out three in one inning.	Mets shortstop Wilmer Flores made two throwing errors that helped Atlanta jump out to a 3-0 lead.	The Braves went up 2-0 in the first when Maybin homered on Niese's second pitch of the game and Nick Markakis reached on Flores' throwing error and scored from second on Jonny Gomes' RBI single.	"I think we believe what we have here even when everyone else may not," Maybin said. "We're athletic, we've got great chemistry, great group of guys. We believe in each other."	Atlanta added on in the third. Gomes walked, advanced to third on Chris Johnson's double and scored when Flores bobbled Christian Bethancourt's grounder and made a wild throw to first that pulled Michael Cuddyer off the bag.	Flores took the blame for making two bad throws and for not covering second in the eighth when Simmons reached on a two-base fielder's choice.	"It's not a good feeling when your pitcher is making the right pitches, getting groundballs and you're not making any plays," Flores said.	Stults blew the lead in the top of the fourth. Wright hit a two-run homer and Mayberry homered to make it 3-all.	Stults allowed seven hits, three runs, one walk and struck out three in five innings.	Mets starter Jonathon Niese gave up seven hits, two walks and three runs -- one earned -- and struck out two in five innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: With Jenrry Mejia nursing inflammation in the back of his shoulder and Bobby Parnell not expected back until next month from elbow ligament replacement surgery, manager Terry Collins believes RHP Jeurys Familia is ready to seize the closer's role.	"If you're a bullpen guy and you want to be a closer and you get the opportunity, you should run with it because we don't know when they're coming back," Collins said.	Braves: Manager Fredi Gonzalez said LHP Mike Minor is still playing long toss but should be getting close in the next few days to throwing off a mound. Minor is on the 15-day disabled list with shoulder inflammation.	UP NEXT	Mets: RHP Dillon Gee, making his first start of the season, is 6-4 with a 2.79 ERA in 14 starts against Atlanta, and he's been even better at Turner Field with a 3-1 record and 2.23 ERA in six starts.	Braves: RHP Julio Teheran, coming off a 2-1 win in the opener at Miami on Monday, is 3-2 with a 3.42 ERA in eight career games -- seven starts- against the Mets.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MILWAUKEE --  In one inning, the Pittsburgh Pirates went from looking lost at the plate to hitting hard liners to the warning track.	Pedro Alvarez homered and drove in two runs, Neil Walker had three hits and the Pirates avoided their first 0-4 start in nine years with a 6-2 win Friday over the Brewers, a night when All-Star Andrew McCutchen left with knee soreness.	"We're not very good at seeing pitches and deciding whether we're going to swing," said Pirates starter Jeff Locke, a career .102 hitter who doubled in the second. "My mind is pretty much made up before I get in the box whether I'm going to swing or not. It just worked out that time."	It wasn't all good news for Pittsburgh: McCutchen left the game after his at-bat in the top of the ninth due to a sore left knee.	"Took himself out after he ran down the line," Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said. "The at-bat, the swing . he felt a little something."	On the mound, Locke (1-0) allowed seven hits and two runs in six solid innings for Pittsburgh, which rebounded after getting swept in three games in Cincinnati to open the season.	The Pirates roughed up Fiers (0-1) for five runs and seven hits in five innings. He struck out eight.	The most damage came in the three-run second, when Walker opened with a double before Alvarez singled him home two batters later and Locke had an RBI double.	It was a disappointing outing after Fiers had struck out the side in the first on 12 pitches.	"They jumped me a couple of first pitches. That one inning kind of got away," Fiers said.	Alvarez led off the fourth with the drive to center for a four-run lead.	DOUBLE TROUBLE	After allowing four doubles on the night, Brewers pitching has now allowed 20 through its first four games.	According to STATS, it is the most doubles allowed by a team in its first four games since at least 1914.	All those extra-base hits are a big reason why the Brewers have opened a season 0-4 for the first time since 2010. It's the first time that Milwaukee has started 0-4 at home since 2003.	Adam Lind had two hits and two RBIs for Milwaukee.	SECOND CHANCE	All-Star outfielder Carlos Gomez played second base in the top of the ninth, the first time he had played the position in his eight-year career.	Manager Ron Roenicke was forced to turn to Gomez after starting second baseman Scooter Gennett was ejected in the bottom of the eighth after arguing with the umpire after a strikeout. Backup infielders Hector Gomez and Luis Jiminez were used earlier as pinch hitters.	Gomez takes grounders during batting practice in the infield, so it wasn't an entirely new position. Still, Gomez said he couldn't fully enjoy his dream of playing the infield in the majors because of the team's scuffling start.	"It is what it is and it's a tough loss today. We have to come tomorrow to try and play," Gomez said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: Third baseman Josh Harrison is 0 for 4 since getting hit in the lower back by a pitch from Reds starter Anthony DeSclafani in the fifth inning of Thursday's 3-2 loss to Cincinnati. He stayed in that game and started Friday night against Milwaukee, going 0 for 3 with three strikeouts, a hit-by-pitch and intentional walk.	Brewers: Outfielder Ryan Braun went 1 for 4 in his return to the starting lineup since leaving the season opener on Monday with what was called "lower right side soreness."	UP NEXT	Pirates: Vance Worley had a subpar spring after going 1-1 with a 4.71 ERA in six starts. The right-hander is looking for a solid outing in his first appearance as Pittsburgh's fifth starter.	Brewers: Lind, Khris Davis and Jean Segura will each try to extend their season-opening hitting streaks to five games. Right-hander Jimmy Nelson makes his 2015 debut on the mound.	---	Follow Genaro Armas at http://twitter.com/GArmasAP	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

PHOENIX --  Ender Inciarte predicted his own starring role Friday night.	Inciarte had a game-ending single with one out in the bottom of the 10th inning, leading the Arizona Diamondbacks to a 4-3 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers.	"I told (David) Peralta I was going to get the at-bat to end the game so I just was waiting for that at-bat," said Inciarte, who had two hits. "It worked out for me."	Pinch-hitter Cliff Pennington drew a one-out walk and went to second on a wild pitch. J.P. Howell (0-1) then walked A.J. Pollock with Pennington stealing third base as ball four went into the dirt.	Dodgers manager Don Mattingly called in Yasiel Puig from the outfield to play third base in a five-man, drawn-in infield but Inciarte hit a grounder just past first baseman Adrian Gonzalez inside the line to bring home Pennington.	"It comes down to the point of hitting it through the infield," said Arizona manager Chip Hale, "hit it through somebody if you have to."	The key for Arizona, Mattingly said, was Pennington stealing third base.	"With Inciarte and you are in first and second and you are at least still in a force situation," Mattingly said. "You are probably not going to double up Inciarte unless he hits a rocket but then you're going to get to Goldschmidt and deal with him. But when he (Pennington) steals third, that hurt us."	Paul Goldschmidt had three hits including his first home run since July 30 for the Diamondbacks, who had dropped 15 of 19 against Los Angeles a year ago.	Yasmani Grandal homered and Jimmy Rollins added a two-run double for the Dodgers.	The Dodgers threatened in the ninth against Addison Reed when Carl Crawford and Juan Uribe hit consecutive one-out singles. But Joc Pederson hit a fly to the warning track in right and Andre Ethier hit a sharp grounder to first to end the inning.	Goldschmidt gave the Diamondbacks a 3-0 lead in the third off Brett Anderson with a drive into the pool area beyond the right-field fence.	Grandal made it 3-1 in the fourth with a homer onto the walkway beyond the center field fence, and Rollins tied the game the following inning with a two-run double to the gap in right-center field against Chase Anderson.	Anderson went five innings, allowing three runs and five hits. He walked three and struck out six, five coming in the first three innings.	Brett Anderson allowed three runs on five hits over six innings with a walk and four strikeouts in his Dodgers debut.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: RHP Kenley Jansen played catch before Friday's game and remains on an every-other-day schedule as he recovers from surgery to remove a growth from the fifth metatarsal in his left foot. Jansen remains two weeks away from throwing off a mound.	RUDY IN THE HOUSE	Actor Sean Astin, who played the title role in the film "Rudy," threw out the first pitch.	WHAT'S IN A NAME	The Dodgers' Brett Anderson and Diamondbacks' Chase Anderson were the first pitchers with the same surname to start the same game since Cleveland's Robert Hernandez and Seattle's Felix Hernandez faced off on April 21, 2012. The last matchup involving a Dodgers' pitcher was June 20, 2009, when the Angels' Jered Weaver started against his brother Jeff.	CONTAINING GONZALEZ	Dodgers 1B Adrian Gonzalez singled to left to raise his batting average to .786 in the first, walked in the fourth and was intentionally walked in the fifth. But the Diamondbacks challenged him his last two at-bats, letting left-handers pitch to Yasiel Puig to get to the left-handed Gonzalez with success. Gonzalez grounded out in the eighth with the bases empty and hit into an inning-ending double play in the 10th, dropping his average back to .688 (11 of 16). It marked only the second time this season Gonzalez had been retired in consecutive plate appearances, the first time in the same game.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: RHP Clayton Kershaw will make his second start of the season, against the Diamondbacks. Kershaw had a no-decision on opening day after allowing three runs and six hits over six innings. Kershaw is 10-7 with a 2.45 ERA in 21 starts against Arizona but was 3-1 with a pedestrian 3.47 ERA last season versus the Diamondbacks.	Diamondbacks: RHP Archie Bradley will make his major league debut against the Dodgers. Bradley, rated the Diamondbacks' top prospect the past two seasons by MLB.com, pitched his way into the rotation this spring, giving Arizona the opportunity to trade RHP Trevor Cahill to Atlanta on April 2.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  The Kansas City Royals returned to Orange County and methodically picked up where they left off in October, and they didn't even need an extra-inning homer.	Kendrys Morales homered, Lorenzo Cain drove in two runs and the defending AL champions remained unbeaten with a 4-2 victory over Los Angeles on Friday night in the Angels' home opener.	Eric Hosmer drove in an early run and Jason Vargas pitched six solid innings against his former team for the Royals, who followed up their season-opening sweep of the White Sox with a win in the same ballpark where they won the first two games of last season's AL Division Series, eventually sweeping the 98-win Angels.	"It's good to get off to a good start," said Hosmer, whose 11th-inning homer won Game 2 of the division series. "It's always tough to come back from a short offseason, and it was our first playoff experience. But for us to close that chapter and start 4-0 ... it just shows we're on a mission and we're not going to let anything get in the way."	Vargas (1-0) yielded five hits and two runs over six innings with little serious trouble for the former Long Beach State star.	"I thought he threw the ball great, executed his pitches and spotted his fastball extremely well," manager Ned Yost said.	Wade Davis capped another strong bullpen performance, pitching the ninth for his first save.	David Freese homered and Kole Calhoun had an early RBI double for the Angels, who have lost their last three home openers.	Hector Santiago (0-1) had a rocky season debut, yielding six hits and three runs while pitching into the sixth.	"His first 50 pitches, Hector really struggled," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "And then he found a nice rhythm and looked like he was on his way."	After taking two of three in Seattle, the Angels returned home to a modest celebration of their AL West title in their 50th home opener at the Big A, the majors' fourth-oldest stadium. The Royals' presence also gave the Angels an ugly reminder of their postseason faceplant, which included dramatic homers into the elevated right-field stands by the Royals.	"We definitely wanted to get some payback, some revenge on these guys, but we're playing again tomorrow," Santiago said. "If we can take two of three, it'll still be a positive series for us."	Mike Trout went 2 for 3 with a walk, but the AL MVP was stranded twice and erased on a double-play grounder by Albert Pujols, who went hitless to extend his season-opening skid to 2 for 15.	Hosmer drilled a single past Johnny Giavotella in the first inning to score Cain. After Calhoun snapped his 1-for-12 skid to tie it in the third, Cain's RBI single put Kansas City ahead in the fifth.	Morales connected in the sixth for his first homer, stepping delicately on home plate at the same stadium where he broke his leg stepping on the plate after hitting a game-ending grand slam for the Angels on May 29, 2010, sidelining him for nearly two years.	Freese hit his second homer of the season in the sixth.	HERE'S JOHNNY	Yost isn't surprised to see Giavotella starting at second base for the Angels, even though the Royals designated him for assignment last December. Giavotella spent parts of the past four seasons in Kansas City, managing just 104 hits. He won a spring training competition to replace Howie Kendrick, the Angels' hits leader in 2014. "Johnny has got a lot of energy, and his work ethic is tremendous," Yost said. "If anybody can do it, he could."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals: Closer Greg Holland didn't pitch after making back-to-back appearances at home. Yost initially said Holland would be available, but the training staff changed his mind. "Just using some common sense," Yost said. "It's a little early to be pushing guys three days in a row."	Angels: RHP Garrett Richards is eager to get back on the mound after his eight-month rehabilitation from knee surgery, but the Angels have assigned him to make a start for Triple-A Salt Lake on Tuesday. The hard-throwing Richards, who won 13 games last year before hurting his knee in August, says he feels ready for the majors after throwing seven strong innings in an intrasquad game Thursday.	UP NEXT	Royals: Jeremy Guthrie makes his season debut.	Angels: Jered Weaver makes his second start of the season after taking a loss on opening day.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  At this rate, Athletics manager Bob Melvin is going to have a hard time leaving Mark Canha's name out of the lineup, no matter the matchup.	The Oakland rookie is off to a fast start this season and Melvin wants Canha to soak it all in.	Canha hit his first major league home run to back a three-hit shutout by Drew Pomeranz and two relievers, and the A's beat the Seattle Mariners 12-0 on Friday night.	Overall, Canha is hitting .500 (7 for 14) with six RBIs.	"It's pretty unbelievable for a number of reasons," Melvin said. "He's earned his time, no doubt. He's swinging the bat great for us."	Canha, who came within inches of hitting a grand slam on Wednesday, went 3 for 5. He reached on an infield single and scored on Ben Zobrist's double in the first. His homer off Walker in the second came on a 2-0 pitch and landed halfway up the bleacher seats in left.	"It's three games," Canha said of his start. "I'm just trying to take it one day at a time. When you're locked in, it doesn't matter who you face sometimes."	Ike Davis drove in four runs and Sam Fuld added three hits for Oakland.	The A's continued their pattern of an on-again, off-again offense by knocking around Mariners starter Taijuan Walker and three relievers. In its three wins this season, Oakland has outscored its opponents 30-0.	Zobrist doubled twice while Marcus Semien added two hits, both coming in the fourth when Oakland scored six times to break the game open.	Pomeranz (1-0) beat out Jesse Chavez for the fifth spot in the A's rotation and showed why in his first start of the season. He gave up just two hits and faced only one batter over the minimum through seven innings.	The Oakland left-hander struck out six and didn't allow a baserunner until Austin Jackson's single to left with one out in the fourth. He promptly got Robinson Cano to hit into a double play on the next pitch, then set down the next seven Mariners.	Fernando Abad pitched the eighth while R.J. Alvarez worked the ninth to complete the shutout.	The A's early offensive outburst helped.	Walker (0-1), who went 4-0 with a 0.67 ERA in the spring, was roughed up. He gave up nine runs and nine hits in 3 1/3 innings with three strikeouts and two walks.	"We were on the receiving end tonight," Seattle manager Lloyd McClendon said. "We'll hand out a few. It was just their night."	HELMET PRIDE	A football helmet from Michigan hung in Pomeranz's locker after the game. It was a gift to the team from Wolverines coach Jim Harbaugh, who visited the A's during spring training. Melvin has decided to occasionally award the helmet to players for their performances. "I'm the first recipient," Pomeranz said, grinning.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: OF Seth Smith sat out his third straight game with a groin strain but McClendon is hopeful of getting Smith back in the lineup Saturday.	Athletics: The team has pushed back plans to activate OF Josh Reddick from the disabled list. Reddick will play at least one more game in the minors before rejoining the big league club. ... Closer Sean Doolittle has extended his long toss workouts to 90 feet. ... LHP Barry Zito gave up five runs and 10 hits in his first minor league start for Triple-A Nashville.	UP NEXT	Mariners: RHP J.A. Happ makes his Seattle debut on Saturday against Oakland. The former Toronto Blue Jays pitcher won his only start against the A's in 2014.	Athletics: RHP Sonny Gray (1-0) makes his second start of the season and eighth of his career against Seattle. Gray carried a no-hitter into the eighth inning against Texas on opening day and has an 18-inning scoreless streak going.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

SAN DIEGO -- Two games into their home schedule, the power-laden San Diego Padres enjoyed a sense of relief when they finally scored a run.	That's all it took to beat the defending World Series champion San Francisco Giants.	Wil Myers hit an RBI double off the right-field wall with one out in the eighth inning and Craig Kimbrel got his first save with the Padres, who beat the Giants 1-0 Friday night.	The run snapped the Padres' 22-inning scoreless streak dating to Wednesday night at Los Angeles. The Padres lost 1-0 to the Giants in 12 innings in their home opener on Thursday.	Myers lofted a fly ball to right and Clint Barmes, aboard on a one-out walk off Jeremy Affeldt (0-1), barreled around third base to score.	The relay throw from second baseman Joe Panik was up the third base line and Barmes ran into catcher Hector Sanchez's arm before he could field the ball, knocking his glove several yards down the first-base line. Sanchez was shaken up but stayed in the game.	"As soon as I hit it and I was running to first base I was screaming at him, `Run,' `' Myers said. "It was good baserunning on his part."	The Giants "didn't execute that cutoff very well," manager Bruce Bochy said.	Myers, one of several star players acquired in the offseason, said there was a definite sense of relief.	He cited starter Brandon Morrow going seven innings and second baseman Jedd Gyorko making a great play in the eighth despite struggling at the plate.	"This was a great team win," he said.	The Giants had pitched 22 consecutive scoreless innings until the eighth.	Joaquin Benoit (2-0) pitched a perfect eighth. Kimbrel, obtained Sunday in a blockbuster trade with Atlanta, allowed one hit in the ninth before inducing Angel Pagan's double-play ball to end the game. It was the fourth double play turned by the Padres.	Each team had only five hits.	"You have to look at the type of pitching we're facing," Bochy said. "It's going to be tough in this ballpark. You have to execute and do the little things."	Tim Lincecum, who no-hit the Padres in both 2013 and 2014, allowed an infield single to Cory Spangenberg with one out in the first.	Lincecum and Morrow each threw seven scoreless innings of four-hit ball. Morrow, signed as a free agent in December, struck out seven and walked three. Lincecum struck out five and walked three.	"I know they are an aggressive team against me," Lincecum said. "I've gotten a lot of these guys to swing at me. I just figured keeping the ball down in the zone, kept them off balance, mixing the ball in and out. I don't think I leaned on any pitch more than the other. I was just going with whatever Sanchy put down for the most part."	Both teams played great defense. San Diego turned four double plays and the Giants three. After issuing consecutive walks to open the seventh, Morrow struck out Brandon Crawford and then got Casey McGehee to ground into a double play.	Gyorko, who's hit into three double plays in two games, made a great over-the-shoulder catch of Gregor Blanco's bloop into shallow center in the eighth.	BALLPARK HOOPS	The Padres are in the preliminary stages of helping to plan a basketball game between San Diego State and the University of San Diego at Petco Park in early December. The court would be placed between home plate and third base. There have been two college basketball games played on aircraft carriers in San Diego, one in 2011 and the other in 2012.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Giants: Bochy said Jake Peavy is good to go for his start Sunday. During extra innings Thursday, "Peavy sprinted to the bullpen -- I didn't tell him to," Bochy said. "He said, `I'll be down there if you need me.' That's Jake, trying to help out."	Padres: RHP Ian Kennedy went on the disabled list with a strained left hamstring suffered in the third inning Thursday. Odrisamer Despaigne, who came on in relief of Kennedy Thursday, will take his spot in the rotation.	UP NEXT	Saturday night's game will feature a marquee matchup between San Francisco's Madison Bumgarner, the MVP of the World Series, and San Diego's James Shields (0-0, 3.00, who lost twice to Bumgarner in the Fall Classic. "It's hard to be believe it's happening already, this early in the season," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "It's good for baseball." Shields, then with Kansas City, lost to Bumgarner in Games 1 and 5. Bumgarner also threw five scoreless innings of relief in Game 7. Shields signed with San Diego in the offseason as part of general manager A.J. Preller's roster revamp.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

NEW YORK -- Brock Holt kept waiting and waiting, hoping for a chance to play. The longest game -- by time -- in Boston Red Sox history came and went, and he sat on the bench the whole way.	Finally given an opportunity, he was plenty fresh.	Holt, the only position player on either side who didn't get into the 19-inning New York City marathon that began Friday night, came back with four hits and three RBIs as the Red Sox ran over the Yankees 8-4 on Saturday.	"I'm probably not going to do that every time I go in there," Holt said.	Joe Kelly (1-0) pitched one-hit ball for seven innings. He got the win and was able to save Boston's bullpen.	"He really gave us a shot in the arm," manager John Farrell said.	Bleary-eyed, the teams started at 1:08 p.m. following a 6-5 Boston victory that finished at 2:13 a.m.	In what became something of a night-day doubleheader, the Red Sox won the rematch in 3 hours, 13 minutes -- quite a speed-up from playing 6 hours, 49 minutes, which didn't include a 16-minute power outage. Mark Teixeira and Hanley Ramirez were among several regulars out of the lineups after playing all 19 innings.	Holt had batted just once this season and was ready to pinch run for David Ortiz or play the outfield if needed in the long win, but his number wasn't called.	"The situation never came up," Holt said.	Farrell, however, told Holt he would be in the lineup Saturday. He batted leadoff, played center field and produced. Holt hit three singles and added a three-run double in the eighth that glanced off right fielder Garrett Jones' glove.	Kelly came off the 15-day disabled list for his season debut. Wanting to be fresh, he left Yankee Stadium in the 10th inning Friday night and fell asleep around the 15th.	He woke up Saturday, checked his phone and saw that Boston had won in the 19th.	His reaction? "Holy crud," he said.	Kelly retired his final 17 batters, starting with a bases-loaded sacrifice fly by Didi Gregorius in the second and leaving with an 8-1 lead.	Kelly had been sidelined by a strain in his right biceps. He struck out eight and gave up a solid single to Alex Rodriguez in the second.	Adam Warren (0-1) allowed one earned run in 5 1/3 innings. Chris Young homered off reliever Alexi Ogando in the eighth.	Rodriguez played first base for the first time in the majors, and his error helped Boston take a 1-0 lead in the second. He let a low throw from the hole by Gregorius bounce off the heel of his glove, allowing Mike Napoli to reach.	"Not that I needed more evidence to tell you how great Mark Teixeira is and has been over there for so many years," Rodriguez said. "I had more action. My head is spinning.	"Just a ball that should be caught, 10 out of 10," he added. "I cost Adam probably another 15 pitches that inning, and that was costly."	Rodriguez later came off the bag to catch a throw; the runner was originally ruled out then was safe after Farrell challenged the call.	Farrell said he got three hours of sleep and was back in the clubhouse by 8:30 a.m. Boston's team bus to the ballpark was pushed back, and players on both sides trickled into the locker rooms an hour or two later than usual.	The teams needed nearly 30 dozen baseballs and 628 pitches for their previous meeting. It was the longest game ever, by time, for the Yankees at home.	By the time it ended, the scoreboard showed empty slots in case the game went 27 innings. The major league record is 26 by Brooklyn and the Boston Braves in 1920, when both pitchers threw complete games and they finished in a tidy 3 hours, 50 minutes.	For umpire crew chief Mike Winters, the game brought back memories from another long day in town.	"I ran the New York City Marathon in 2007 with my wife," he said. "And I finished 26 miles in less time than it took to play that game -- by an hour."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: Closer Koji Uehara (strained left hamstring) was scheduled to pitch for Class A Greenville on Saturday night.	Yankees: C Brian McCann didn't play. He was knocked down by a nasty foul off the top of his right knee cap in the ninth Friday and stayed in for nine more innings.	UP NEXT	Masahiro Tanaka starts for the Yankees vs. Clay Buchholz on Sunday (8 p.m., ESPN) to wrap up the three-game series. Tanaka lasted just four innings in an Opening Day loss, and another poor start would surely fuel speculation that his damaged right elbow is a problem.	STILL WAITING	Napoli was hitless in four at-bats, leaving him at 0-for-17 this season. He has scored three runs.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

CINCINNATI --  Matt Adams' first hit sent the Cincinnati Reds to their first loss.	The St. Louis first baseman snapped a hitless start to the season at 10 at-bats with a leadoff homer in the fourth inning, lifting the Cardinals to a 4-1 victory Saturday that ended the Reds' winning streak at four.	"I got to the park early, and my early work felt good," said Adams, who was robbed of a hit in the second inning on a diving catch by left fielder Marlon Byrd. "It carried over into the game. He left a changeup up, and I was able to get the barrel through it."	Kolten Wong had a sacrifice fly, Jhonny Peralta and Yadier Molina added ninth-inning RBI singles and Michael Wacha pitched into the seventh to get the win in his first appearance of the season.	Wacha (1-0) shook off Todd Frazier's first-inning home run to go 6 1/3 innings, allowing five hits and one run with a walk and two strikeouts. He stranded a runner in scoring position in each of his last four full innings and needed just 76 pitches to earn the win.	"That team over there is very aggressive early in the count," he said. "I was able to keep it down in the zone and get some weak contact."	The Reds left five runners in scoring position. Cincinnati's fourth-through-eighth batters are hitting .200 or less.	"We didn't have much going on offense, but it was a close game until the end," manager Bryan Price said.	Trevor Rosenthal, the Cardinals' fifth relief pitcher, got five outs for his second save.	Adams led off the fourth inning by lofting a one-strike pitch 355 feet down the right-field line and on to the netting above the visitors' bullpen to give St. Louis a 2-1 lead.	That was the only earned run allowed by Reds starter Johnny Cueto in 14 innings this season -- a 0.64 ERA. Cueto (0-1), who turned in seven shutout innings without a decision in Cincinnati's 5-2 win over Pittsburgh in Monday's opener, again went seven, giving up four hits and two runs with four strikeouts. He also hit a batter.	Frazier, before a sellout crowd of 41,525 on his bobblehead day, gave Cincinnati the lead with his third home run of the season, a 342-foot drive into the seats down the left-field line on a 3-0 pitch with two outs in the first.	The Cardinals tied it by loading the bases with one out on Frazier's error of Peralta's sharp one-hopper -- Cincinnati's first error of the season -- a hit batsman and Molina's single, setting up Wong's tying sacrifice fly. Molina's hit was his first in 11 at-bats.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: Jon Jay returned to the starting lineup on Saturday after getting Friday off so that Randal Grichuk could get some playing time. Grichuk responded with a two-run homer.	Reds: The Reds have used the same starting lineup for their first five games after being able to use last year's projected starting eight just 12 times all season. The last time the Reds used the same lineup for a season's first five games was 1989, according to Elias Sports as reported by the team.	UP NEXT	Cardinals: After 11 career relief appearances against the Reds, Carlos Martinez makes his first start against Cincinnati and his first start of the season on Sunday. The right-hander pitched a scoreless relief inning last Sunday against the Cubs in Chicago.	Reds: Cuba native Raisel Iglesias is set to make his major league debut with a start on Sunday.	PACK `EM IN	Saturday's sellout crowd was Cincinnati's second in five games. The Reds needed 23 games to log their second sellout last season.	THE BIRD'S A TARGET	Jon Jay led the majors by being hit with pitches 20 times in 2014. His first of 2015 helped the Cardinals tie the game at 1-1 in the second inning.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

CHICAGO --  Pinch-hitter J.B. Shuck's tiebreaking RBI single in the eighth inning on Saturday helped the Chicago White Sox to their first win of the season.	Now he hopes the 5-4 victory over the Minnesota Twins is the start of something big.	"It's a great feeling," said Shuck, who drove in Alexei Ramirez. "It's a good team-building win right here. I think we're going to roll off this one."	Shuck lined a 1-1 pitch from reliever Blaine Boyer (0-1) with two outs, scoring Ramirez. Conor Gillaspie was thrown out at the plate as he tried to score from second.	Former Yankees closer David Robertson struck out the side in the ninth for his first save with Chicago. The White Sox lost their first four games.	Left-hander Zach Duke (1-0) worked a scoreless eighth for the win.	In his first home start for the White Sox, Jeff Samardzija gave up four runs and eight hits in seven innings. He struck out six without walking a batter.	White Sox first baseman Adam LaRoche snapped a 1-for-14 slump with his first home run of the season, leading off the second against Mike Pelfrey.	The Twins sent eight men to the plate in the second as Samardzija gave up four runs and five hits, including two for extra bases. Chris Herrmann tripled in a run while second baseman Brian Dozier doubled home another in a 35-pitch inning for Samardzija.	"I was in the middle of the plate too much there in the second," Samardzija said. "I'm trying to be aggressive and get quick outs. .  But I love the way I came back and made a couple adjustments and got on the edges and got down."	The White Sox loaded the bases with none out in the third but managed just one run on Avisail Garcia's infield single. But Ramirez grounded into a double play and Gillaspie grounded out to end the inning.	Geovany Soto tied it 4-all with a leadoff home run to left in the fourth, his first of the year.	Pelfrey, making his first start since May 1, 2014, departed after five innings. He yielded  four runs and seven hits. He walked one and struck out two.	"I was happy to see him try and compete," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.  "He got the last six outs in a row, I think after the tying home run. So we were able to get five innings out of him. (But) It was a game where he had to battle every inning, every pitch."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Twins: RHP Ricky Nolasco went on the 15-day disabled list (right elbow inflammation) and RHP Trevor May was called up from Triple-A Rochester and will start Monday's home opener against Kansas City. ... Twins RHP Casey Fien felt better after experiencing right shoulder stiffness Friday. "Obviously you're not going to put a guy out there and put him in jeopardy if you don't have to," Molitor said.	White Sox: Manager Robin Ventura is not concerned that Sale has faced only minor leaguers while recovering from a broken right foot. "He's the guy I want going out there tomorrow, I don't care if he's faced a hitter or not," Ventura said. ... Chicago reinstated LHP Eric Surkamp from the 15-day disabled list (upper back strain) and assigned him to Triple-A Charlotte.	UP NEXT	White Sox LHP Chris Sale returns from the disabled list (right foot fracture) for his season debut Sunday.

Abreu has reached in all five games this season and has a .300 on-base percentage. He was 0 for 3 on Saturday but reached in the third inning when Pelfrey hit him with a pitch.	KEEPING TORII FRESH	Torii Hunter sat out Saturday as the Twins try to keep the 39-year-old outfielder sharp. "Hopefully we can keep him fresh by giving him a (rest) here or there," Molitor said.  Hunter was 1 for 5 with a stolen base in Friday's 6-0 win over the White Sox.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- Nelson Cruz knew he was going to start hitting. It was just a matter of time.	Cruz hit his first home run for Seattle and Brad Miller threw out a runner at the plate in the 10th inning and doubled in the go-ahead run in the 11th, lifting the Mariners over the Oakland Athletics 5-4 Saturday.	Signed to a $57 million, four-year contract as a free agent, Cruz entered 1 for 15 (.067) with no extra-base hits.	He had three hits Saturday, including a three-run homer in the eighth off Dan Otero that put the Mariners in front 4-2.	"It's always important. I need to hit. The whole lineup needs to contribute," Cruz said. "We needed this win, most importantly. The whole lineup contributed, getting hits and scratching out runs. We got a W. That's what we needed."	Oakland tied the score in the bottom half on RBI doubles by Ben Zobrist off Danny Farquhar and Brett Lawrie against Carson Smith.	Logan Morrison singled against Fernando Abad (0-1) leading off the 11th, advanced on Dustin Ackley's sacrifice and scored when Miller sliced a fastball into the left-field corner for an opposite-field hit.	Tyler Olson (1-0) pitched around two hits and two walks in the 10th, getting help when Ben Zobrist was thrown out at the plate trying to score from first on Ike Davis' one-out double off the center-field fence. Austin Jackson grabbed the ball with his bare hand off a hop and threw to Miller. Zobrist hesitated between first and second bases and was thrown out by Miller, who made a one-hop throw to catcher Mike Zunino for the tag.	"I was thinking ball off the wall, runner on first, extra innings, he's probably going to go for it," Miller said. "In that situation you have to. So I just wanted to get it to Z. It was kind of a tough hop and he stuck it. He's a strong guy. I don't want to be running into him."	With runners on second and third and two outs, Marcus Semien grounded into an inning-ending forceout.	"I put myself into kind of a jam by not getting ahead with first-pitch strikes," said Olson, who earned his first major league win. "Having to battle through that showed myself a lot."	Fernando Rodney pitched a perfect 11th for his second save.	Otero allowed just his second run in 13 appearances against the Mariners, his first in 12 games.	"Once it got to 1-1, I was going to try and come in on him but it stayed right there," Otero said. "It wasn't a terrible pitch, but unfortunately in that situation it turned out that way."	A's starter Sonny Gray allowed two runs -- one earned -- and six hits in 7 1/3 innings. Ackley homered leading off the third, ending Gray's consecutive scoreless innings streak at 20 dating to Sept. 23.	Seattle starter J.A. Happ gave up two runs and seven hits in 6 1/3 innings.	Josh Phegley and Marcus Semien gave Oakland a 2-1 lead with RBI singles in the seventh.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: Seth Smith (groin tightness) returned to the lineup after missing three games. INF Chris Taylor (wrist) is participating in baseball drills for Triple-A Tacoma.	Athletics: RHP A.J. Griffith (elbow surgery) and LHP Sean Nolin (core surgery) were scheduled to face hitters in a simulated game at extended spring training in Arizona. RHP Jarrod Parker (elbow) is slated to throw three innings of 15 pitches each against a Milwaukee Brewers minor league team on Monday, also in Arizona.	UP NEXT:	Felix Hernandez (1-0, 1.29) starts Sunday. He is10-2 with a 2.62 ERA in 18 starts at Oakland, and his 19 wins against the A's are his most against any team.	Jesse Hahn (0-1, 4.50) makes his second start for the A's on Sunday. He did not allow an earned run in over seven innings in his only career appearance against the Mariners, last June for San Diego. He gave up five hits, two to Robinson Cano.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

CLEVELAND --  Ian Kinsler hit an RBI single and Yoenis Cespedes doubled in two runs during Detroit's four-run ninth inning as the Tigers stayed unbeaten with a 9-6 win over the Cleveland Indians on Saturday.	Kinsler's fourth hit -- a single off closer Cody Allen (0-1) -- snapped a 5-all tie and helped the Tigers improve to 5-0 for the first time since 2006. The Tigers had to rally twice after Cleveland's Jerry Sands delivered a pair of clutch doubles.	Miguel Cabrera also had four hits for Detroit, which has now outscored its opponents 39-11.	Ian Krol (1-0) got the win despite giving up an eighth-inning double to Sands.	Indians catcher Yan Gomes sustained a potentially serious injury to his right leg in the ninth. Gomes leg was struck by Tigers outfielder Rajai Davis as he tried to keep his foot on the plate for a force. Davis slid hard through the catcher's leg, and Gomes remained on the ground for several minutes. He did not put any weight on his leg as he was helped off the field.	Cleveland manager Terry Francona said Gomes sprained his knee and will undergo further tests, including an MRI, on Sunday. Francona did not think Davis made a dirty play.	Tigers manager Brad Ausmus agreed.	"He's one of the best catchers in the game, so I hope he's fine for his sake and for the Indians' sake," Ausmus said.	Moments after Gomes went down, Cespedes doubled with two outs into the right-field corner to give Detroit a three-run lead.	The Tigers were able to overcome starter David Price's throwing error, an injury to Victor Martinez and Sands' star turn to stay perfect in 2015.	With the Indians four outs from another loss, Sands, serenaded by Cleveland fans with chants of "Jer-ry, Jer-ry," delivered his second, two-out, two-run double to tie it at 5. Sands gave Cleveland a 3-2 lead in the sixth with a two-run double before the Tigers scored three times in the seventh.	Cy Young winners Price and Corey Kluber both pitched well enough to win, but came away with no-decisions.	Price didn't allow an earned run in 5 2/3 innings, and may have cost himself his second win with a throwing error in the sixth, when the Indians took the lead and chased the left-hander.	Kluber gave up a leadoff homer to Anthony Gose on his second pitch in the first, but the right-hander found his groove and finished with 10 strikeouts in 6 1/3 innings.	Down 2-0 and unable to mount any threat against Price, the Indians went ahead 3-2 thanks to Sands, who two games into his Indians career has become an instant cult hero. He received lengthy standing ovations both times he went to the outfield following his hits.	But after Sands' double in the sixth, the Tigers answered with three runs in the seventh as Kinsler, Cabrera and Martinez hit RBI singles.	After Martinez lined his single to center, Detroit's designated hitter pulled up as he reached the bag. Ausmus and a trainer came out to check on the five-time All-Star, who left the game with an unspecified injury to his left leg.	The Indians were without their best position player, Michael Brantley, who missed his third game with a troublesome back.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: RHP Justin Verlander (strained right triceps) will throw a 40-pitch bullpen session Sunday. The former Cy Young winner, who is on the disabled list for the first time in his 11-year career, tossed a side session Friday and Ausmus said Verlander "is moving in the right direction."	Indians: LHP Marc Rzepczynski, who was struck on the foot by a grounder Friday, was available to pitch. In Friday's 8-4 loss in the opener, the reliever committed a wild throwing error, which Francona was able to laugh about a day later. "If it was hockey, they would've called icing because there was nobody on that side of the line," he cracked.	UP NEXT	Tigers: Rookie LHP Kyle Lobstein makes his second career start at Progressive Field, where he struck out 10 in a no-decision Sept. 2. He made seven appearances over the final six weeks of the 2014 season, going 1-2 with a 4.35 ERA.	Indians: LHP T.J. House, who went 4-0 with a 2.67 ERA against AL Central teams last year, makes his season debut after winning a job in the opening-day rotation during training camp. The Indians went 7-0 in his starts after Aug. 20 last season.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

MIAMI --  Chris Archer committed a throwing error that allowed his first batter to reach on opening day. In his second outing, he delivered mostly strikes.	Archer needed just 84 pitches to complete seven sparkling innings, and the Tampa Bay Rays beat the Miami Marlins 2-0 on Saturday.	Archer (1-1) allowed one hit and one walk, with the latter runner erased trying to steal. He had command of his fastball, which was still hitting 98 mph in the seventh inning, and kept the Marlins off balance with sliders and changeups.	"Everything felt great," Archer said. "When you're locating your fastball, it makes your secondary stuff twice as good."	And the right-hander's fielding was improved: He had an assist in each of the first four innings. Archer's lengthy outing gave the Rays bullpen a much-needed break following a 10-9, 10-inning loss Friday.	"He threw all of his pitches for strikes and attacked the zone," said catcher Bobby Wilson, who made his first start of the season. "When he's pitching like that, it's a lot of fun."	Two relievers completed a two-hitter, with Brad Boxberger pitching the ninth for his second save in two chances. Boxberger struck out Giancarlo Stanton looking on a 3-2 fastball with a runner on to end the game.	"I didn't do what I should have," Stanton said.	Pinch-hitter Tim Beckham hit his first career homer leading off the seventh. Evan Longoria doubled home the other run.	"I happened to get one on the barrel, the first ball I've hit hard this season, and it felt good," Beckham said.	The Marlins scored 10 runs in their lone victory Friday and have totaled three runs in their other four games. Adeiny Hechavarria is batting .056, Jarrod Saltalamacchia is at .077, Martin Prado is batting .167 and Stanton is at .200.	"It's not an ideal start," Stanton said.	Archer retired his first 10 batters before Christian Yelich doubled, and the right-hander escaped by retiring Stanton and Michael Morse. Pinch-hitter Ichiro Suzuki walked in the sixth but was caught stealing.	Marcell Ozuna singled in the eighth for Miami's other hit.	Jarred Cosart (0-1), making his first start of the season, lost despite allowing only one run in six innings.	The Rays won with six hits. They jumped in front in the sixth when Asdrubal Cabrera tripled off Cosart with two out and came home on Longoria's double.	"I was just trying to find an open space of grass and push a run across," Longoria said. "The way Arch was throwing the ball, you got the feeling early that a run or two could make the difference."	The Rays ended a streak of five consecutive losses to Miami.	RAYS RECORD	Longoria's double gave him 425 career extra-base hits, surpassing Carl Crawford's team record of 424.	"It's pretty cool," Longoria said. "I plan on being here for a long time. I figure if I keep doing my job, the records are attainable."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: LHP Drew Smyly (shoulder) will make another rehab start Tuesday for Class-A Charlotte. He pitched two scoreless innings and threw 23 pitches in his first rehab start Thursday. ... RHP Ronald Belisario (shoulder) will pitch in an extended spring training game Monday.	UP NEXT	Marlins RHP Henderson Alvarez is scheduled to start the final game of the series Sunday against RHP Nathan Karns. Alvarez allowed only two runs in seven innings on opening day against Atlanta but took the loss. Karns allowed six runs in 5 2/3 innings in his first start Tuesday against Baltimore.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

BALTIMORE --  Ubaldo Jimenez finally gave the Baltimore Orioles exactly what they wanted when they spent $50 million to sign him as a free agent.	Jimenez struck out eight and allowed one single over seven sparkling innings, Jonathan Schoop hit a grand slam and the Orioles cruised to a 7-1 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays on Saturday night.	Alejandro De Aza and Chris Davis homered for the Orioles, who rebounded from a 12-5 loss to Toronto in their home opener Friday.	Jimenez (1-0) also enjoyed a bounce-back performance following a poor 2014 season. After signing the most lucrative contract the franchise ever offered a free agent pitcher, the right-hander went 6-9 and lost his place in the starting rotation.	Following an effective spring training in which he successfully overhauled his mechanics, Jimenez retired 21 of 23 Toronto batters.	"You have to forget about what happened in the past and you have to forget quick," Jimenez said. "It doesn't matter whether it is good or bad. You can't do anything with the past."	Jimenez got nine straight outs before Jose Reyes hit a sinking liner to left that a diving De Aza barely missed grabbing. Jimenez then retired eight in a row -- not allowing a ball out of the infield -- before walking Reyes in the sixth.	"Tonight was a good reminder why he's been a good quality major league starter for a long time," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. "If you've got any type of heart or feelings at all you know how much it means for him to contribute."	After Tommy Hunter worked a hitless eighth, Zach Britton gave up a double to Steve Tolleson and an RBI single to Edwin Encarnacion in the ninth.	Aaron Sanchez (0-1) allowed three runs and seven hits over 3 1/3 innings for the Blue Jays in his first major league start. He surrendered two homers, twice as many as he yielded last season in 24 games as a reliever.	"Obviously, this isn't the way I want to start the season," Sanchez said. "I got out there and tried to slow things down too much. I started aiming a little bit. It was not the night I wanted."	On Friday, the Blue Jays scored four first-inning runs and rolled to an easy victory. In this one, the Orioles wasted no time taking control. De Aza marked his 31st birthday by driving Sanchez's second pitch over the right-field wall, and Davis hit an opposite-field shot to left with one out for a 2-0 lead.	It was the first homer of the year for Davis, who hit 53 two years ago and 26 last season through Sept. 10 before a 25-game suspension for using Adderall.	The only home run Sanchez allowed last year was to Davis on Aug. 5.	Baltimore used three singles and a double-play grounder by Adam Jones to make it 3-0 in the third.	That was more than enough offense for Jimenez.	"He was just throwing strikes," Toronto manager John Gibbons said. "I think that's the best we've seen him since he came over here."	The Orioles pulled away in the fifth against Todd Remond. A single and two walks loaded the bases for Schoop, who hit a 1-1 pitch into the left-field seats for his first career grand slam.	CLUBHOUSE TV	Blue Jays: While some of the players were watching the end of the Yankees-Red Sox game, Dioner Navarro and Jose Bautista were glued to the Barcelona-Sevilla Spanish league soccer game on an iPad. Navarro was wearing a Lionel Messi jersey and cheered each time the forward touched the ball.	Orioles: The players mostly ignored the Yankees-Red Sox game, focusing instead on the Master's.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: Bautista returned to the lineup after leaving Friday's game with leg cramps.	Orioles: LHP Wesley Wright was placed on the 15-day list after experiencing tightness in his left shoulder while pitching Friday. The Orioles recalled RHP Eddie Gamboa from Triple-A Norfolk to fill out the bullpen.	ON DECK	Blue Jays: RHP Drew Hutchison (1-0, 1.09 ERA) is making his second start after holding the Yankees to one run over six innings in Toronto's 6-1 victory on opening day.	Orioles: RHP Chris Tillman (1-0, 1.35 ERA) is looking to pick up his second win after allowing just one run in 6 2/3 innings in a 6-2 victory over Tampa Bay in the season opener.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PHILADELPHIA -- Odubel Herrera doubled home the winning run in the 10th inning with his first major league hit, lifting the Philadelphia Phillies to a 3-2 comeback win over the Washington Nationals on Saturday night.	Carlos Ruiz led off the inning with a single off Tanner Roark (0-1). He advanced on a deep flyout and scored when Herrera doubled down the right-field line.	Wilson Ramos hit a solo homer for the Nationals, who wasted a strong outing by Doug Fister.	Dustin McGowan (1-0) pitched a scoreless 10th to get the win with a big assist from his defense.	Phillies left fielder Ben Revere made a perfect one-hop throw to the plate to throw out speedy Michael Taylor trying to score from second on Yunel Escobar's single. Revere was moved to left late in spring training because his inability to make strong throws from center hurt the Phillies.	Cole Hamels gave up just two hits in seven innings, but one was Ramos' homer. Hamels rebounded from a poor performance on opening day, when he gave up four homers in an 8-0 loss to the Red Sox. His only mistake was a high fastball that Ramos drove out to right in the fourth. Ramos was 3 for 18 off Hamels before connecting for an opposite-field shot.	Fister allowed six hits in 6 1/3 scoreless innings. Fister led the Nationals with 16 wins in 2014, but begins the year as the No. 5 starter in a star-filled rotation.	Down 2-0, the Phillies rallied against Blake Treinen in the eighth. Chase Utley, 1 for 17 to that point, hit a one-out single. Ryan Howard followed with an opposite-field, RBI double off the left-field wall. Cesar Hernandez ran for Howard and scored the tying run on a single by Ruiz.	After Grady Sizemore lined a double to right, the Phillies squandered an opportunity to take the lead. Herrera hit a bouncer to second and Ruiz was thrown out at the plate. Andres Blanco struck out looking, ending the inning.	Pinch-hitter Clint Robinson's RBI single off Jeanmar Gomez gave the Nationals a 2-0 lead in the eighth. Danny Espinosa, back to switch-hitting after hitting right-handed in spring training, led off with a double and scored on the hit.	The Phillies had a runner on second with no outs three different innings and failed to score.	A strong throw to the plate by Nationals second baseman Espinosa prevented a run in the first, when Utley was out trying to score from first on Howard's double to right.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: LF Jayson Werth hit a home run in a rehab game for Class A Potomac on Saturday. Werth was 1 for 4 with two walks in a doubleheader. He played left field in the first game and designated hitter in the second. Werth is recovering from offseason shoulder surgery. He'll take off Sunday and could be in Washington's lineup on Monday against Boston.	Phillies: Herrera was back in the starting lineup for the first time since he fouled a ball off a foot on opening day. RF Domonic Brown didn't play Saturday at Class A Clearwater. The 2013 All-Star has been sidelined since March 19 because of tendinitis in his left Achilles tendon. He could be out another two weeks.	UP NEXT	Nationals: RHP Max Scherzer (0-1) tries again for his first win with the Nationals in the series finale Sunday. The 2013 AL Cy Young Award winner who signed a $210 million in the offseason allowed three unearned runs in a loss on opening day. Scherzer is 1-1 with a 4.50 ERA in two career starts vs. the Phillies.	Phillies: RHP Sean O'Sullivan will be recalled from Triple-A Lehigh Valley to start on Sunday. O'Sullivan was 0-1 with a 6.39 ERA in three games last season.	---	Follow Rob Maaddi on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AP-RobMaaddi	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

MILWAUKEE --  Spring training gave Milwaukee's Jimmy Nelson time to test his offspeed pitches, even though his 6.23 exhibition ERA indicated he was struggling.	A masterful performance Saturday against Pittsburgh gave the Brewers' young starter a huge boost of confidence.	Nelson struck out a career-high nine in seven innings, Jean Segura hit a two-run homer and Milwaukee became the last team in the majors to win this season by beating the Pirates 6-0 on Saturday.	"I didn't question anything at all, I just stuck to the process," Nelson said about his spring struggles. "I was pretty happy with the work I've put in. Hopefully it'll stay right there. I'm just happy we got this one for the team, really."	At 0-4, the Brewers had been off to their worst start since 2011. Both Milwaukee and the Chicago White Sox won Saturday, leaving every team in the majors with a win.	Music blared through the Brewers clubhouse. There was a sense that the club could collectively exhale.	"I hope so. They feed on me too. The guys wanted to see me smile today," manager Ron Roenicke said. "I had a lot to smile about in that ballgame."	Especially with Nelson, the Brewers' top young pitcher. He landed the fifth starter's job following the vacancy in the rotation left by the offseason trade of veteran Yovani Gallardo to Texas.	On Saturday, Nelson turned into a stopper.	"I think he's started throwing his curveball, which, I don't think he threw that in the past," said Pirates outfielder Corey Hart, who went 0 for 3.	Nelson did indeed work on a curve in spring training, as well as his slider. He was already known for a sinking fastball.	But the curve, if Nelson continues throwing it the way he did on Saturday, could be the third pitch that he needs to win consistently.	"He has so much movement on his fastball that you have to be ready for it ... He dropped a lot of first pitch curveballs in there," Roenicke said. "If he can continue to do that, he's going to have a fun year."	Nelson (1-0) allowed two hits and benefited from two double plays.	BATS ALIVE	Hector Gomez added a two-run single for Milwaukee, which stopped a four-game losing streak by tagging Vance Worley (0-1) for six runs and seven hits in 6 1/3 innings.	Offseason acquisition Adam Lind had his ninth hit in his fifth game with his new team, tying a club record. Khris Davis led off the fourth with a double that set up Segura's deep homer to left-center for a 5-0 lead.	Segura is hitting .400 on the young season and driving the ball. He's off to a good start after struggling in 2014.	"As soon as you get that feeling, you're going to be comfortable no matter what," Segura said. "You don't care who's on the mound, who's pitching."	FIRST AT SHORT	Jung Ho Kang started at short for Pittsburgh, becoming the first position player to jump from the Korea Baseball Organization to the majors. He went 0 for 3 with two strikeouts.	Kang said through an interpreter that he "wasn't really anxious."	"I feel good about it. There (is) a lot more to work on and show Korea and Major League Baseball."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: Outfielder Andrew McCutchen was held out as a precaution for left knee soreness. Manager Clint Hurdle described McCutchen's status to return to the starting lineup as considered day-to-day, though the 2013 NL MVP said he planned to return to center on Sunday.	Brewers: Outfielder Ryan Braun went 0 for 3 with a walk in starting back-to-back games for the first time since leaving the season opener. Braun had what was termed as "lower right side soreness" after tracking down a fly ball to the wall.	UP NEXT	Pirates: Right-hander Casey Sadler has been called up from Triple-A Indianapolis to make his first big league start on Sunday. He's taking Francisco Liriano's turn with the left-hander on paternity leave after his wife gave birth to the couple's fourth child, a daughter, on Friday.	Brewers: Starter Kyle Lohse will try to rebound after a miserable opening day outing during which he gave up eight runs and 10 hits in 3 1/3 innings.	--	Follow Genaro Armas at http://twitter.com/GArmasAP	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ATLANTA -- Julio Teheran pitched effectively into the seventh inning and the Atlanta Braves stayed hot with a 5-3 victory Saturday night over the New York Mets, who learned earlier that injured closer Jenrry Mejia was suspended 80 games for a positive drug test.	The Braves began the season looking to rebuild after trading several big-name players, but instead they improved to 5-0 for the first time since beginning the 1994 season 7-0. Atlanta's franchise record for consecutive wins to begin a season is 13, set in 1982.	Freddie Freeman homered for the Braves. Jim Johnson faced four batters in the ninth to earn his first save of the season.	Teheran (2-0) allowed three baserunners through the first six innings, but he retired none of the five batters he faced in New York's three-run seventh.	He appeared to hurt his right leg when the leadoff batter, Lucas Duda, singled up the middle, but Teheran stayed in the game after manager Fredi Gonzalez and a team trainer visited the mound.	Third baseman Alberto Callaspo was charged with a fielding error on Juan Lagares' RBI force attempt that cut the lead to 5-1. Teheran was chased after hitting Travis d'Arnaud with a bases-loaded pitch that made it 5-2.	Reliever Brandon Cunniff got Wilmer Flores to ground into a double play that scored the third run.	Teheran struck out five while giving up two hits, four walks and three runs -- one earned.	Freeman's homer, his first of the season, made it 1-0 in the second and was his 14th homer in 73 career games against the Mets.	The Braves went up 5-0 in the fifth on RBI doubles by Christian Bethancourt and Andrelton Simmons, Eric Young Jr.'s RBI triple and Nick Markakis' RBI single.	That ended the night for Mets starter Dillon Gee (0-1), who gave up eight hits and five runs and struck out two in five innings.	Gee has pitched at least five innings in 47 straight starts, longest active streak in the majors. He had gone 3-0 with a 1.74 ERA in his previous three starts against Atlanta.	The Braves improved to 100-55 against the Mets at Turner Field.	LINEUP SHUFFLES	Mets: After two costly throwing errors in Friday's 5-3 Atlanta win, Flores was back in the lineup at shortstop and had no apparent difficulties.	"He had a bad night, you know?" said Collins, who told Flores to stay relaxed in the field. "He's got to go out and play."	Collins added the team will stay with its plan before the series and start SS Ruben Tejada on Sunday. Collins doesn't want Tejada to get rusty.	Braves: Gonzalez said all spring that he liked the versatility of his "small ball" roster. Gonzalez has stayed true to his word, using five different lineups in the first five games.	UP NEXT	Mets: RHP Bartolo Colon (1-0) has a 0.43 ERA with victories in each of his three career starts at Turner Field. In six career starts against Atlanta, Colon is 4-2 with a 2.00 ERA and has allowed one homer in that 45-inning stretch.	Braves: LHP Alex Wood (1-0) gave up two runs or fewer in 10 of 12 home starts last year. In five career starts against the Mets, however, Wood is 0-2 with a 4.10 ERA.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Yovani Gallardo waved to some of his hometown friends in the stands before his first home start for the Texas Rangers. Then he tried to concentrate on pitching.	Gallardo struck out seven while working into the sixth inning, and Adrian Beltre circled the bases on a triple and error to put Texas ahead for good early in a 6-2 win over the Houston Astros on Saturday night.	With his family watching from a suite and fans in several spots in the stands, Gallardo (1-1) scattered eight hits in his first appearance at Globe Life Park, just a few miles from where he grew up in Fort Worth. The right-hander was part of an offseason trade with Milwaukee, where he had spent his entire career after getting drafted in 2004.	"It's one of the things that I wanted to do all my life as a young kid," said Gallardo, who lost at Oakland on opening day. "And then stepping out there for the first time is definitely a lot more adrenaline and exciting. Just trying to go out there and not try to do too much. It's always a hard thing to do."	Elvis Andrus had a two-run single when Texas scored three more unearned runs in the fifth inning after the second of three Houston errors.	"We didn't finish plays that we normally do," Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. "I was a little surprised by that."	Marwin Gonzalez homered in his first at-bat of the season.	Roberto Hernandez (0-1) allowed five hits and five runs -- but just one earned -- while walking four in 4 2/3 innings in his debut for Houston. The 10-year veteran right-hander made the team after going to spring training with a minor league deal.	Beltre's first-inning triple was helped by right fielder George Springer, who allowed the ball skip past him when he tried to play a carom off the wall barehanded. The play seemed over when Gonzalez saw Beltre off the bag and tried to surprise him, but he threw wildly to Hernandez sneaking in behind Beltre, letting Beltre trot home.	Houston first baseman Chris Carter set up Texas' three-run fifth when he dropped a throw from reliever Joe Thatcher on a two-out grounder back to the mound by Moreland with the bases loaded, allowing Carlos Peguero to score. Andrus' bouncing single to left drove in Prince Fielder and Jake Smolinski for a 5-1 lead.	"I really thought we did a number of things tonight that allowed us to win the ballgame," said Texas manager Jeff Banister, a winner at home for the first time. "That's what we need to do all year long."	ESCAPING TROUBLE	Gallardo got one of three strikeouts of Carter to leave the bases loaded in the third inning. He retired Jake Marisnick on a popout with runners at second and third in the fourth as the Astros stranded 13 runners. Gallardo allowed eight of Houston's 11 hits, starting with Gonzalez's homer after he retired the first eight Houston batters.	THE TWO-HIT CREW	Beltre, who also doubled, had two hits along with Mitch Moreland and Peguero, making his Texas debut after getting promoted from Triple-A Round Rock. Peguero filled in for right-fielder Shin-Soo Choo, who is day to day after leaving Friday's home opener early with back spasms.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: RHP Josh Fields (right groin) was expected to pitch Saturday night for Triple-A Fresno on a rehab assignment in Reno, Nevada.	Rangers: LHP Derek Holland was placed on the 60-day DL with a left shoulder strain after pitching one inning in the series opener, and LF Ryan Rua went to the 15-day DL after spraining his right ankle in the series opener. ... RHP Jon Edwards was called up from Round Rock.	UP NEXT	Astros: LHP Dallas Keuchel starts after throwing seven shutout innings in his first career opening-day start against Cleveland and beating AL Cy Young Award winner Corey Kluber.	Rangers: RHP Colby Lewis, a 3-1 winner over Oakland in his debut, is 5-1 with a 1.54 ERA in 10 appearances with seven starts against the Astros.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DENVER --  Before third baseman Mike Olt even left the game after being hit on the right wrist, speculation already was beginning.	Twitter was filled with talk about the possible promotion of top prospect Kris Bryant.	Wait on that, though. Olt insisted he's fine and may even be able to play soon, given the way the wrist feels now.	Olt may be dinged up, but he also helped ignite this offense. Chris Coghlan and Olt hit consecutive solo homers in the third inning, Dexter Fowler had two triples and the Chicago Cubs ended the Colorado Rockies' bid for their best start in team history with a 9-5 win on Saturday night.	The Rockies were attempting to improve to 5-0 for the first time. This is the fifth occasion they have won four of their first five.	After the game, Olt had his wrist tested, and initial results seem to indicate it doesn't appear to be broken. That was a relief for Olt, who initially feared the worst when Adam Ottavino's nasty breaking pitch hit him in the ninth.	"I couldn't feel anything. I think it was from the shock of getting hit," Olt said. "Once I was walking away, I was moving it around. I wasn't as nervous."	Fans were already tweeting about Bryant, who's expected to spend the first few weeks at Triple-A Iowa.	Olt understands.	"As I said before, he deserves all the hype he can get," Olt said. "He's one of the best in the minor leagues and one of the best I've seen."	Starlin Castro also added a solo shot for the Cubs, who entered without a home run this season. Chicago was limited to three runs through the opening three games, but finally erupted at hitter-friendly Coors Field. The Cubs had 12 hits Saturday, which was as many as they had coming in.	"We had a nice day," Cubs manager Joe Maddon said.	So did Jason Hammel (1-0), who allowed three runs and eight hits in six innings against his former team. He also had two singles.	Kyle Kendrick?	Not so nice a night.	Kendrick (1-1) surrendered a career-high eight runs in five innings. That was quite a contrast from the opener, when he pitched seven shutout innings.	"Obviously, the command wasn't there," said Kendrick, who walked five.	Did the mystique of Coors Field mess with him?	"My command could have been like that anywhere," Kendrick said. "I just got to stay after it. You're not going to win many games walking five guys."	Fowler had two triples in a game for the fourth time, the first since Aug. 29, 2010, at Coors Field, when he was with the Rockies. He also walked twice and drove in two runs.	"Any time you get things going, it puts a smile on my face," Fowler said.	Hammel is accustomed to pitching in this environment, compiling a 4.95 ERA in 49 appearances at Coors Field with the Rockies from 2009-11. His only mistake was grooving a fastball in the second inning to Nolan Arenado, who hit it into the left-field seats for a two-run homer.	Corey Dickerson added a two-run single in the eighth to make it 9-5. Colorado had runners on first and second with two outs, but Pedro Strop struck out pinch-hitter Wilin Rosario, who hit a go-ahead homer in the 10th last Wednesday in Milwaukee.	For a fourth straight game, Maddon batted his starting pitcher eighth. Before Maddon came along, the Cubs said they batted the pitcher outside of ninth in the order once -- on Sept. 8, 2012 -- in 15,848 games from 1914 to last season.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: OF Chris Denorfia (strained left hamstring) will begin a rehab assignment at Class A Myrtle Beach on Sunday.	Rockies: LHP Jorge De La Rosa (sore groin) will not make his season debut next week in San Francisco even after an encouraging bullpen session Saturday. Instead, De La Rosa will throw at Triple-A Albuquerque on Tuesday. "We're not concerned," manager Walt Weiss said. "This gives him a little more time to feel confident mentally about the groin."	UP NEXT	Cubs: RHP Kyle Hendricks makes his season debut Sunday. He went 7-2 with a 2.46 ERA as a rookie last season.	Rockies: RHP Jordan Lyles (1-0, 3.00) is 2-1 with a 4.34 ERA in five starts against the Cubs.	--	Follow Pat Graham at http://twitter.com/pgraham34	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

PHOENIX --  Archie Bradley dazzled in his major league debut.	Pitching in front of his parents, the 22-year-old outperformed NL MVP Clayton Kershaw and led the Arizona Diamondbacks over the Los Angeles Dodgers 6-0 Saturday night.	"If you can't get excited and get ready to pitch against Clayton Kershaw, you need to go get yourself checked out," Bradley said. "I didn't want to get too high. I just wanted to stay calm and remember what we talked about in trying to get them out and just stay within myself."	The seventh overall pick in the 2011 amateur draft, Bradley allowed one hit in six innings. He struck out six, walked four and singled for his first hit. He became the fifth rookie starter since 2003 to make his first start against a reigning Cy Young Award winner and the fourth to earn a win.	"He's a confident kid," Diamondbacks manager Chip Hale said. "It's exciting for him, exciting for the ball club, exciting for the organization."	Kershaw (0-1) lasted 6 1/3 innings and gave up 10 hits, including Paul Goldschmidt's two-run homer in the seventh. Goldschmidt has home runs in four straight games against the Dodgers dating to last season.	Kershaw did not allow 10 or more hits in any regular-season game in 2014. He struck out five and walked three.	Mark Trumbo had a run-scoring single in the top of the first.	Bradley singled in the second but was picked off by Kershaw.	Goldschmidt drove in A.J. Pollock with a groundout in the third and the Diamondbacks scored twice in the fourth after the first three hitters reached base, two on walks. Pollock and Ender Inciarte drove in the runs.	Pollock and Inciarte, the first two batters in the Diamondbacks' order, combined for five hits off Kershaw, with three for Pollock. He entered 4 for 19 against Kershaw.	"When he gives you a pitch you can handle, you've really got to jump on it," Pollock said. "We did a good job."	Trumbo added two hits. The Diamondbacks, 4-15 against the Dodgers last season, have wins in the team's first two meetings of this season.	"I basically got blasted," Kershaw said. "I'm sure they didn't hit great pitches. I'm sure I was missing some spots, leaving the ball up. I made a lot of mistakes."	Bradley walked off the mound to end the sixth to a rousing ovation from the crowd.	"I was trying to hold it in," Bradley said. "When I got in the dugout that's when it hit me. I really want to cherish this and I'll remember it for a really long time."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: 3B Justin Turner cut a finger after being spiked on his right hand trying to apply a tag to Pollock in the bottom of the third inning and left the game. Pollock was sliding on a steal attempt and was called out but Turner dropped the ball for an error. ... Juan Uribe, originally scheduled for a day off, replaced Turner at third briefly before Alex Guerrero took over in the fourth. Uribe left after a half-inning due to left hamstring tightness. The Dodgers used four third basemen, with Darwin Barney entering the seventh on a double switch.	Diamondbacks: Backup catcher Gerald Laird was unable to play due to back tightness. He was scheduled to be in the lineup but Hale went with Tuffy Gosewich, knowing that the club had a third catcher available, Jordan Pacheco. ... C Oscar Hernandez, on the 15-day disabled list with a broken hand, is on track to return next month and will start swinging a bat next week, Hale said.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: Zack Greinke, who didn't get a decision in his first start of the season on Tuesday, was 3-0 against the Diamondbacks last season with a 1.42 ERA, 26 strikeouts and seven walks.	Diamondbacks: Opening-day starter Josh Collmenter takes the mound for the Diamondbacks in the series finale. Collmenter failed to make it out of the fifth inning with four earned runs allowed against San Francisco on Monday. He's 4-7 with a 5.66 ERA in 15 career games (seven starts) against the Dodgers.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

SAN DIEGO -- This is what the new-look San Diego Padres are supposed to look like.	After a tame start to the season, the Padres hit the ball all over the yard to back new ace James Shields, who outpitched October nemesis Madison Bumgarner in a 10-2 victory against the San Francisco Giants on Saturday night.	Bumgarner, the World Series MVP, lasted only three innings, allowing five runs and 10 hits.	San Diego had 20 hits off three pitchers, matching its Petco Park record. Matt Kemp had four hits, while Yangervis Solarte and Will Middlebrooks had three each. Shields had a single, his first hit with the Padres.	"I've been waiting for one of these games to happen," said Kemp, the centerpiece addition in an offseason roster revamp. "This was a good game to get under our belt and kind of let everybody relax. It's a game that can carry over to tomorrow."	It also should calm the fans who were wondering where all that vaunted offense was.	"It came tonight," Kemp said. "Hopefully, we can keep it going."	Shields (1-0) held the Giants to one run and three hits in seven innings, struck out seven and walked one for his first victory with the Padres. He signed as a free agent in February. He combined with two relievers to hold the Giants to five hits.	Bumgarner beat Shields, then with Kansas City, in Games 1 and 5 of the World Series, and then pitched five scoreless innings of relief in Game 7.	"It's a new team," Shields said. "My job is to beat whoever I'm opposing. I don't care if it's the Giants or the Dodgers or anybody else. My job is to get a win. We got one tonight."	Bumgarner (1-1) allowed two hits each to Justin Upton, Derek Norris and Middlebrooks.	"We had a lot of quality plate appearances," Padres manager Bud Black said. "We were patient yet aggressive at the same time. We were ready to hit and we were ready to hit mistakes. We laid off the borderline pitches. That goes to us really being aware of what this guy has, which is great stuff. He's a great pitcher. But we took advantage of some pitches that were up over the plate."	Bumgarner said he had trouble with his release point "and I just wasn't putting the pitches where I wanted to. I wasn't very effective and I need to get that all squared away. Everything was flattening out a little bit and I didn't have crispness on pitches.	"I'm not taking anything away from those guys," he said. "You still have to hit the ball. They've got a good ballclub."	Shields' only mistake was allowing a home run by Joaquin Arias leading off the fourth, his first this season. In the fifth, Shields deflected a comebacker from former Royals teammate Nori Aoki with his glove, recovered and threw him out.	The Padres got to Bumgarner for two runs in the first. Kemp's double to left was the first of four straight hits with two outs. Upton and Middlebrooks each had an RBI single.	San Diego added three more in the third, when Norris, Middlebrooks and Jedd Gyorko hit consecutive RBI singles.	Vogelsong took over starting the fourth and held the Padres until sixth, when they scored three more runs, one of them unearned. Myers had an RBI single, Kemp a bases-loaded, RBI infield hit and Upton a sacrifice fly.	PITCHERS' BP	Justin Machado, brother of surfing great Rob Machado, is the head baseball coach at La Costa Canyon High in northern San Diego County and would sometimes throw batting practice to Shields in the offseason. "He told me I shouldn't be hitting BP," Shields said. "I wanted to hit a round. He said I'd be bunting a lot. So far it's been the complete opposite. I haven't gotten the bunts down and I got a hit. I need a little more work on the bunting."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Giants: Third baseman Casey McGehee strained his left knee running out a fly ball in the first inning and came out of the game. He was replaced by Arias.	UP NEXT	The four-game series concludes when Giants RHP Jake Peavy, who won the 2007 Cy Young Award while with San Diego, makes his season debut against Padres RHP Tyson Ross who got a no-decision at Los Angeles Tuesday night.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Jeremy Guthrie put his Game 7 loss to San Francisco in the World Series behind him long ago, as did his teammates, and started focusing on helping the Kansas City Royals repeat as AL champions.	Guthrie threw 94 pitches in his season debut on Saturday night, allowing four runs and six hits over seven innings in a 6-4 victory over the Los Angeles Angels that extended the Royals' season-opening winning streak to five games.	"I was very proud of these guys and the way we all played straight through to the finish line last year," Guthrie said. "I don't think I ever hung my head. From the moment the season was over, my chin was up for what we accomplished. Do I wish I personally could have done better in Game 7? Do I wish we could have gotten a couple more hits? Of course."	Mike Moustakas and Salvador Perez homered during a five-run fourth against Jered Weaver (0-2). Greg Holland followed Wade Davis out of the bullpen and pitched a perfect ninth for his third save. The Royals and Atlanta are the only big league teams whose relievers have not allowed a run.	"We know the strength of our club, and everyone really buys into our style of play," Royals first baseman Eric Hosmer said. "If we can get that lead and keep adding on to it, and then give it to those guys in the back end of the bullpen, we're confident against anybody."	Weaver threw 85 pitches in 4 1/3 innings and was charged with six runs, seven hits and four walks after striking out four of his first six batters.	"Early on in 6 o'clock games here, it's real tough to pick up his ball. He was keeping us off-balance and we struggled a little bit," Hosmer said. "But after that first time through, I think our guys really settled in."	Held hitless through three innings, the Royals sent nine men to the plate in the fourth and took a 5-1 lead. Moustakas led off with a drive deep into the seats in right-center, Alex Rios hit a go-ahead two-run single, and Perez capped the outburst with a two-out, two-run homer just inside the left-field pole.	"Everything that I was throwing was up -- just like in Seattle," Weaver said, referring to his opening-day loss. "I can't get the ball down and I can't get ahead of guys."	Hosmer chased Weaver with a single in the fifth after a one-out walk to Lorenzo Cain, and former Angels switch-hitter Kendrys Morales greeted Drew Rucinski with an RBI single.	The Angels closed to 6-4 in the bottom half with Calhoun's two-out, two-run double and an RBI single by AL MVP Mike Trout. Calhoun is 4 for 7 against Guthrie with two homers and six RBIs.	Calhoun, who tied for the major league lead last season with 17 home runs in the leadoff spot, drove a 1-0 pitch to left-center for his fifth career leadoff homer.	"I thought Jeremy threw well," Royals manager New Yost said. "He made two mistakes all night long, and both of them were to Calhoun."	Alex Gordon, the only starter in Kansas City's batting order without a hit, was plunked by Cesar Ramos in the seventh inning, and Moustakas was hit in the ninth by Jose Alvarez. The Royals have had nine batters hit by pitches in their first five games.	"That's all part of baseball," Hosmer said. "They've trying to work us in, and we know that. It's nothing personal -- just baseball."	This was the first matchup between Weaver and Guthrie since Aug. 29, 2010, when Guthrie pitched Baltimore to a 1-0 victory as Matt Wieters hit a sacrifice fly.	TROUT HAS BLOSSOMED EARLIER THAN MOST	If Trout homers in any of his next three games, the Angels' 23-year-old center fielder would join Eric Davis as the only players in big league history with at least 100 home runs, 100 stolen bases and 300 RBIs in their first 500 regular-season games.	UP NEXT	Royals: RHP Yordano Ventura, the youngest opening-day starter in the majors this year at 23, is coming off a 10-1 win at Chicago in which he left in the seventh inning after 81 pitches because of a cramp in his thumb.	Angels: LHP C.J. Wilson is making his second start, after pitching eight innings of two-hit ball in a 2-0 victory at Seattle last Tuesday. He is 4-0 with six saves in 17 career games against Kansas City.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CLEVELAND -- Nobody rocks Cleveland like Miguel Cabrera.	Detroit's menacing slugger homered twice and drove in four runs as the Tigers moved to 6-0 for the first time in 30 years with an 8-5 win over the Cleveland Indians on Sunday.	Cabrera, who entered the series batting just .182, hit a two-run homer in the first inning off T.J. House (0-1) and J.D. Martinez added an insurance solo shot in the ninth as the Tigers finished off a series sweep, improving to 18-5 in Cleveland since 2013.	Cabrera went 4 for 4 with his first two homers of the season, a double and single. With Cabrera needing a triple for the cycle, Indians manager Terry Francona intentionally walked him in the eighth even though there was a runner on first.	During the three-game series, he went 11 of 14 (.786) with six RBIs, and raised his average to .520.	"He's special, man. He's special," Tigers second baseman Ian Kinsler said. "He's fun to watch and a game should be sold out just because of him. People should just want to come watch him hit. It's incredible."	Not to the Indians.	Cabrera pounds Cleveland pitching like no one else. For his career, he's batting .357 with 37 homers and 118 RBIs in 133 games against the Indians, who haven't figured out a way to even slow him down. Cabrera has 23 homers -- the most by any player -- at Progressive Field, which had its right-field section remodeled during the winter. Cabrera threatened to renovate left field with his two homers.	Cabrera isn't just partial to Cleveland's ballpark.	"He's a freak anywhere we go," Justin Verlander said.	The Tigers are 6-0 for the first time since 1985, and they've served early notice that they're not going to give up their spot atop the AL Central without fight.	"I'll put it in perspective," manager Brad Ausmus said. "It's the first week of the season and I'm not ready to throw any parties."	The Tigers jumped to a 6-0 lead after two innings, giving Kyle Lobstein (1-0) a comfortable cushion. Joakim Soria worked the ninth for his second save.	The Indians had a rough opening weekend at home in their spectacularly remodeled ballpark. In addition to being swept by the division's four-time reigning champions, All-Star outfielder Michael Brantley missed two games with a back issue and Cleveland lost catcher Yan Gomes for at least six weeks with a sprained knee.	After the Indians pulled within 6-3 in the third, Cabrera led off the fourth with his second homer.	Francona said the Indians would have walked Cabrera when they could, but there weren't opportunities.	"He's that good a hitter and when he feels that good at the plate, that's a bad feeling," Francona said.	The top of Detroit's lineup did the majority of the early damage, as the Tigers top five hitters went 6 for 6 with six runs, a homer and three walks in the first two innings.	Detroit didn't let House get out of the second, rocking the left-hander for six runs and six hits in 1 1/3 innings -- the shortest outing of his career.	Cabrera put the Tigers up 3-0 in the first with a 410-foot shot onto the pedestrian plaza in left. No injuries were reported.	"I don't think it's just us. I don't think it's just our pitching," Indians second baseman Jason Kipnis said. "I said it to maybe Kinsler or someone on second, 'I'm glad we got to lock him back in' and he's like, 'You think you're the only team that locks him back in?' He's just a special hitter."	ACE MENDING	Verlander (strained right triceps) threw a bullpen session with no discomfort Sunday and is expected to pitch in a simulated game Wednesday in Pittsburgh. Verlander threw about 45 pitches including curveballs.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: DH Victor Martinez was in the lineup despite leaving Saturday's game in the seventh inning with a left leg injury. Martinez appeared to hurt himself on an overswing. He hit an RBI single and gingerly jogged to first before he was replaced by a pinch runner. Martinez has had multiple surgeries on his left knee, most recently in February.	Indians: Brantley missed his fourth game with a back issue. Francona said Brantley felt "slightly better" after resting Saturday and believes two more days -- the Indians are off Monday -- of rest will help. Francona remains hopeful Brantley won't go on the disabled list, but hasn't ruled it out.	UP NEXT	Tigers: RHP Anibal Sanchez starts as Detroit opens a three-game interleague series in Pittsburgh. He blanked Minnesota on three hits over 6 2/3 innings in his season debut.	Indians: After an off-day, RHP Carlos Carrasco starts the opener of a two-game home series with the White Sox. Carrasco struck out 10 in his first start last week, one day after signing a four-year, $22 million contract.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CINCINNATI --  The St. Louis Cardinals want leadoff batter Matt Carpenter to drive the ball. He sure did Sunday.	Carpenter hit a two-run homer off Kevin Gregg in the 11th inning, lifting St. Louis over Cincinnati 7-5 in a game that featured the major league debut of Cuban right-hander Raisel Iglesias for the Reds.	Carpenter's 392-foot drive to center on a full-count pitch from Gregg (0-1) followed Kolten Wong's single and delighted Cardinals' manager Mike Matheny.	"We've talked to him about utilizing his power," Matheny said. "You're going to see that from him from time to time."	Carpenter's go-ahead drive followed Jhonny Peralta's two-run, tying homer in the eighth off of Jumbo Diaz, which quieted the crowd of 41,446, Cincinnati's third sellout of the six-game homestand.	"That was huge," Carpenter said. "He's been swinging the bat well all season."	Carlos Villanueva (1-0) pitched two innings, working out of a bases-loaded jam in the 10th by striking out Todd Frazier. St. Louis took two of three in the series and has won 13 consecutive three-game series against Cincinnati, putting a damper on a homestand that opened with four consecutive wins and frustrating second-year manager Bryan Price.	"It was a nice homestand but today was a game we should have won," said Price, who joined the team in 2010 as pitching coach. "Since I've been here, the Cardinals has been a team that has beaten us. At the end of the World Series, no one cares how many times you beat a certain team, but to reverse that, yes, it's important to me."	Iglesias allowed three runs and five hits in five innings with two walks and four strikeouts. Signed last July to a $27 million, seven-year contract, he became the first Reds player since Mike Leake in 2010 to reach the majors without playing a minor league game.	Iglesias gave up two hits and a walk through the first four innings, then fell behind 3-1 in the fifth. Yadier Molina doubled leading off, and Carpenter hit a two-run single and scored from first on Jason Heyward's double into the right-field corner. Heyward was thrown out trying to stretch his hit into a triple, with second baseman Brandon Phillips making the relay after Jay Bruce's throw.	St. Louis starter Carlos Martinez struck out a career-high eight in six innings, giving up two runs and four hits.	Bruce led off the second with his second homer of the season and Billy Hamilton cut the Cardinals' lead to 3-2 in the sixth with his first homer.	Frazier had a two-run single and Phillips followed with an RBI hit to give Cincinnati a 5-3 lead in the seventh.	BREAK TIME	The Reds varied their starting eight for the first time this season, with Brennan Boesch replacing Marlon Byrd in left field and Brayan Pena taking over for Devin Mesoraco at catcher. Pena was the last position player to play for the first time this season. Byrd and Mesoraco both were 2-for-20 (.100) in the first five games.	TIMEOUT	Reds manager Bryan Price was ejected by crew chief Joe West in the top of the eighth after Jon Jay was hit by a pitch. The ejection was the third for Price, who is in his second season as manager.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: Catcher Tony Cruz was expected to rejoin the team in St. Louis on Sunday night. Cruz started paternity leave Friday.	Reds: Catcher Brayan Pena left the game in the seventh after injuring his left shoulder in a fall at first base while beating out a leadoff bunt.	ON DECK	Cardinals: Adam Wainwright will pitch for the first time in eight days when he starts St. Louis's home opener on Monday against Milwaukee. The right-hander's second start of the season was pushed back by last Tuesday's rainout in Chicago.	Reds: The Reds get their first look at under-renovation Wrigley Field when they open their first trip of the season on Monday in Chicago. Mike Leake is 4-0 with a 1.71 ERA in his last four starts against the Cubs.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

MIAMI --  The Miami Marlins endured a rain delay despite their retractable roof. They were the last team in the majors to hit a home run. And by the end of a miserable season-opening homestand, they even had trouble showing up on time.	Center fielder Marcell Ozuna was benched Sunday for pregame tardiness, and the offense was again a no-show for much of the game as the Marlins lost to the Tampa Bay Rays 8-5.	Miami came into the season with high hopes but went 1-5 on a homestand that began with the roof gaffe on opening day and deteriorated from there.	"It could have been worse," catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia said. "We could have been 0-6."	In the finale, the Rays' Nathan Karns allowed two hits in seven innings for his second career victory. The Marlins' offense finally came alive late in the game, and Saltalamacchia hit their first homer in the ninth, but they lost two players with similar injuries.	Reserve third baseman Don Kelly and backup catcher Jeff Mathis each broke the ring finger on his right hand.	"Tough day all the way around," Mathis said.	Tough week, actually. Despite a late surge after the Marlins fell behind 7-2, they're batting only .213. Four of the eight regulars are at .200 or below.	"We've got some guys pressing -- you can see it -- trying to do way too much," manager Mike Redmond said.	The Marlins' $325 million right fielder, Giancarlo Stanton, went 0 for 4 and dropped his average to .158. There were a few jeers from the crowd of 20,199 when he fouled out in his final at-bat.	Stanton also committed an error that helped the Rays score a run in the first inning, and his indecision with a throw allowed Kiermaier to stretch a hit into a double.	"We haven't played well really all week," Redmond said. "We've got to dig deep right now and see what we're made of."	Ozuna, scratched from the lineup as punishment for being late, apologized and said he didn't realize the pregame workout was earlier than usual.	"It was my fault," he said. "I say sorry, and it's not going to happen again."	Karns (1-1), making his seventh career start, allowed two runs -- one earned -- and lowered his career ERA from 6.67 to 5.65.	David DeJesus had a three-run homer off Henderson Alvarez (0-2).	"He hit a sinker that didn't sink," Alvarez said.	Alvarez allowed four runs in five innings. He fell to 1-6 with a 5.06 ERA in seven career starts against Tampa Bay.	For the second game in a row, the Rays' Tim Beckham came off the bench to deliver an extra-base hit, this time a pinch-hit RBI triple in the sixth. Kevin Kiermaier doubled twice and has seven extra-base hits. Catcher Rene Rivera snapped out of an 0-for-17 start with two RBI doubles and a single.	"We feel confident as an offensive side right now," DeJesus said. "You can see the at-bat we've been getting -- just quality, professional at-bats throughout the lineup today. Guys are not putting pressure on themselves. We're not trying to be the hero. We're just moving the line."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: RHP Alex Colome (pneumonia) pitched three scoreless innings in his first rehab start Saturday for Single-A Charlotte. He's scheduled for another start there Thursday. ... OF John Jaso is not swinging a bat yet, but the swelling in his bruised left wrist has gone down.	Marlins: Kelly was hurt fielding a grounder in the second inning. Mathis was hit by a pitch while behind the plate in the eighth.	UP NEXT	Rays: RHP Jake Odorizzi (1-0, 0.00) will start in Toronto's home opener Monday. He pitched 6 2/3 scoreless innings in his first start Wednesday against Baltimore.	Tampa Bay is 2-10 in opponents' home openers.	Rookie RHP Matt Andriese will make his first career start Tuesday for the Rays, who play their next 22 games against the AL East.	Marlins: RHP Mat Latos (0-1, 94.50), coming off the shortest outing of his career, again faces Atlanta when the Marlins start a 10-game trip Monday. Latos allowed seven runs in two-thirds of an inning Tuesday against the Braves.	"I get redemption," Latos said. "It's always good to get a second chance. Something like that hasn't happened to me before in my six-year career. I made some changes in my mechanics, and it will be good to get past it."	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

BALTIMORE --  In a contentious duel with a deep, dark history, Jose Bautista got the final word against Darren O'Day.	Bautista hit the last of Toronto's three home runs, and the Blue Jays beat the Baltimore Orioles 10-7 Sunday to complete a solid season-opening road trip.	After the Orioles cut a five-run deficit to 8-7, Bautista's two-run drive in the eighth off O'Day gave Toronto the cushion it needed.	The O'Day-Bautista confrontation has a history that includes tight pitches, strong language and home runs. This time, after O'Day threw a pitch behind the slugger, Bautista hit his first long ball of the year.	"Emotion of the moment. There's history there," Bautista said. "He's hit me a few times, he's thrown behind me a few times, and I've got him a few times."	It was his fourth home run in 15 career at-bats against the sidearmer, who's hit him twice.	"The smart play there was once I fell behind him, just try to pitch around him," O'Day said. "That's honestly what I was trying to do."	After the victory the Blue Jays headed north, hoping home-field advantage means more to them than it did to their opponents during the first week of the season.	Toronto won two of three from the Yankees in New York before duplicating the feat against the defending AL East champions at Camden Yards. Next up for the Blue Jays: Their home opener Monday night against Tampa Bay.	"It feels like we've been on the road forever," manager John Gibbons said. "It's been a long haul, so. So it'll be good to get back home."	Dalton Pompey and Kevin Pillar went deep for the Blue Jays, who doubled their home-run total for the season. Toronto scored 23 runs in the three-game series, twice reaching double figures.	Adam Jones and Travis Snider both homered and drove in three runs for Baltimore, and Manny Machado got his first hit to snap an 0-for-15 skid to start the season.	Orioles starter Chris Tillman (1-1) allowed seven runs, three earned, and six hits in 2 2/3 innings.	"They came out swinging," Tillman said. "I was never able to get any real command of any of my pitches."	Aaron Loup (1-1) pitched 1 2/3 perfect innings after starter Drew Hutchison gave up a career-high tying seven runs and seven hits in 4 1/3 innings.	Miguel Castro worked the ninth for his second save. After Pillar made an outstanding diving catch of a foul ball to left, Chris Davis hit a routine fly to Pillar with two runners on to end it.	Pompey put Toronto up 2-0 in the first inning with a drive to the top of the right-field scoreboard that wasn't called a home run until after a replay review of more than two minutes.	Jones countered in the bottom half with a two-run shot to center, but the Blue Jays took the lead for good when Pillar homered leading off the second.	Toronto made it 7-2 in the third. After Tillman walked the bases loaded, rookie Devon Travis hit a two-out liner to right that Snider broke in on before backtracking. The ball glanced off his glove for an error, allowing three runs to score, and Jose Reyes greeted reliever Kevin Gausman with an RBI single.	Davis and Jones delivered RBI singles in the Orioles' half.	Snider hit his first home run with Baltimore, a three-run drive in the fifth that made it 8-7 and chased Hutchison.	MILESTONE HOMERS	Blue Jays: Bautista's homer was his 204th with Toronto, moving him past Joe Carter into sole possession of third place on the team's career list.	Orioles: Jones' home run was his 91st at Camden Yards, tied with Brady Anderson on the career list behind Rafael Palmeiro (124).	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: OF Michael Saunders (left knee surgery) played five innings in the outfield with Class A Dunedin Saturday and was expected to DH Sunday. Toronto GM Alex Anthopoulos said Saunders could possibly return during the homestand.	Orioles: 2B Jonathan Schoop was scratched with a sore left quadriceps and replaced by Ryan Flaherty.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays: Toronto sends R.A. Dickey (1.42 ERA) to the mound against Tampa Bay in the opener of a four-game series.	Orioles: LHP Wei-Yin Chen starts for Baltimore against the visiting Yankees and RHP Michael Pineda to start a three-game series.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ATLANTA --  A rare run-scoring hit from Bartolo Colon helped give the New York Mets a boost going into their home opener.	Colon helped himself with his first RBI in a decade, Daniel Murphy hit a tiebreaking sacrifice fly in the eighth inning and the Mets beat Atlanta 4-3 Sunday, sending the Braves to their first loss this season.	Michael Cuddyer's two-run homer in the first inning gave Colon the early lead, but the burly pitcher's bloop single for a 3-2 lead in the fourth was the most-discussed hit.	"When he puts it in play, he gets a cheer, so when he gets a hit it's a double cheer," Mets manager Terry Collins said.	The Mets return from a 3-3 trip for their home opener against the Phillies on Monday.	Colon lost his batting helmet and broke his bat when he punched the single into shallow right field to drive in Wilmer Flores from third base. With his helmet left behind in the batter's box, Colon grinned as he stood on first base following his first RBI since June 10, 2005, for the Los Angeles Angels against the Mets.	Colon, 41, said he wasn't sure how long it had been since his last RBI.	"Maybe it was 20 years ago," he said through a translator, bullpen coach Ricky Bones.	Colon's hit ended a 0-for-37 slump and was his sixth career RBI. He was only 2 for 62 (.032) with the Mets last year.	"He was the jack of all trades today," Cuddyer said. "He was fun to watch."	Braves starter Alex Wood, who allowed three runs in 6 2/3 innings, said Colon "just wailed at a fastball and broke his bat and hit a bloop."	Colon led 3-2 before Jonny Gomes' seventh-inning homer just inside the left-field pole. Colon (2-0) allowed three runs and six hits in seven innings.	Juan Jaime (0-1) walked Curtis Granderson and Anthony Recker opening the eighth. Wilmer Flores sacrificed, and Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez ordered an intentional walk to Ruben Tejada, loading the bases.	Left-hander Andrew McKirahan, making his major league debut, threw two quick strikes before giving up Murphy's fly ball.	Colon gave up a two-run triple to Andrelton Simmons in the second.	NEW CLOSER	Jeurys Familia got two outs for his first save. Closer Jenrry Mejia, already on the disabled list, was suspended for 80 games Saturday following a positive test for the steroid Stanozolol.	Collins let Jerry Blevins record the first out in the ninth before turning the game over to Familia, who struck out Gomes and ended the game on Phil Gosselin's flyout.	TOO MANY WALKS	Gonzalez said Jaime couldn't afford to open the eighth with two walks.	"It's the old saying: You can't walk people," Gonzalez said, adding the walks put McKirahan in a tough spot.	TRAINING ROOM	Mets: Collins said Murphy was "kind of fatigued a little." Murphy had problems with his right hamstring in spring training. Collins said Murphy's legs "are fine." ... Collins said RHP Bobby Parnell, recovering from Tommy John surgery last April, probably will begin his minor league rehab in the Florida State League at a time still to be determined.	Braves: LHP Mike Minor, on the 15-day DL with left shoulder soreness, had more discomfort while attempting to intensify his throwing program in Florida. He returned to Atlanta to be examined by team doctors and will be closely monitored as he tries to restart his throwing program.	UP NEXT	Mets: Collins is expecting RHP Jacob DeGrom to have a memorable start against the Phillies on Monday. "I think it's something he should remember for a long time," Collins said. DeGrom allowed two runs in six innings in a 2-1 loss to the Nationals on Wednesday. RHP Aaron Harang (1-0) is scheduled to start for the Phillies.	Braves: RHP Shelby Miller, who received no decision while throwing five scoreless innings in Atlanta's 2-0 win in the third game of an opening, three-game sweep at Miami, will face the Marlins for the second time in six days in Monday night's series opener. Mat Latos will start for Miami.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

PHILADELPHIA -- This is the kind of victory that could get the Nationals going.	Wilson Ramos drove in what would be the winning run in the 10th inning with his second RBI of the day, and Washington defeated the Philadelphia Phillies 4-3.	Bryce Harper homered and Clint Robinson had three hits Sunday for the Nationals, who salvaged a win in the three-game series.	"It's always good for morale when you squeeze out wins like this," starter Max Scherzer said.	Darin Ruf homered and Cody Asche had three hits and an RBI for Philadelphia.	Yunel Escobar led off the 10th with a double off Jake Diekman (0-1). Harper was asked to sacrifice bunt but failed in two attempts before his groundout moved Escobar to third.	Justin De Fratus replaced Diekman, but his first offering to Ryan Zimmerman was a wild pitch, allowing Escobar to score to put Washington up 3-2. Ramos' RBI single later made it a two-run game.	"A nice piece of hitting by Ramos," manager Matt Williams said.	Drew Storen walked the first two batters in the bottom of the 10th, and the Phillies got within a run on Odubel Herrera's two-out infield single. But Zimmerman made a diving stop on Cesar Hernandez's grounder and flipped to Storen for the final out, giving Storen his second save in as many chances.	Aaron Barrett (1-0) pitched a scoreless ninth with a pair of strikeouts for the win.	Scherzer, Washington's prized offseason acquisition, wasn't as sharp as opening day and had to settle for another no-decision. Scherzer left with the lead after allowing one run on six hits in six innings with eight strikeouts and two walks.	"My fastball command was kind of off, but I had good command of my off-speed pitches," Scherzer said. "I only gave up one run, and that's something I can hang my hat on."	Ruf greeted reliever Xavier Cedeno with a drive to left to lead off the seventh for his first career pinch-hit home run, which tied the score at 2-2.	Philadelphia's Sean O'Sullivan, called up from Triple-A Lehigh Valley before the game to make a spot start, gave up two runs on five hits in six innings. He walked five and struck out two.	"O'Sullivan gave us a big lift," manager Ryne Sandberg said.	Harper's opposite-field shot with two outs in the first staked the Nationals to a 1-0 lead. It was the second homer of the season for Harper, who had been 1 for 11 with seven strikeouts in his last three games.	The Nationals tacked on a run in the fourth on Ramos' sacrifice fly.	The Phillies got their lone run off Scherzer in the fifth on Asche's RBI single.	HOWARD'S STRUGGLES	Ryan Howard went 0 for 4 with four strikeouts. He stranded six runners, including three in scoring position, and was replaced at first base by Ruf in the eighth. Howard was booed after each of the last three strikeouts, with the volume increasing for each one. He is batting .150 with seven strikeouts in 20 at-bats this season.	"He was a little behind the fastball and didn't connect today," Sandberg said. "Hopefully, he can regroup. He's going to continue to work at it, I know that. Hopefully, it's a one-day thing."	GREAT EXCITEMENT	O'Sullivan was thrilled when he found out he would be opposed by Scherzer, mainly because he wanted to hit against him to see the former Cy Young winner's stuff up close. O'Sullivan drew a walk off Scherzer in the fifth and eventually scored.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: OF Jayson Werth (shoulder) could rejoin Washington for Monday's game against Boston. Werth didn't play Sunday at Single-A Potomac, where he homered in the first game of a doubleheader Saturday during a rehab start.	Phillies: OF Domonic Brown (Achilles) homered Sunday during a rehab start with the Phillies' Single-A team in Clearwater. Brown is scheduled to rejoin the Phillies in 2/3 weeks.	UP NEXT	Nationals: Washington visits Boston for the Red Sox home opener Monday, with Nationals RHP Jordan Zimmermann (1-0, 1.50) facing Rick Porcello (0-1, 4.50).	Phillies: RHP Aaron Harang (1-0, 0.00) looks to extend his recent success against the Mets in New York's home opener Monday. Harang went 2-1 with a 0.90 ERA in three starts against the Mets last season with the Braves. Reigning NL Rookie of the Year Jacob de Grom (0-1, 3.00) starts for New York.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

CHICAGO -- The first pitch was a 96 mph fastball for a called strike. The last one was a 98 mph heater that went for a swinging strike three.	Yup, Chris Sale is healthy again.	The lanky left-hander pitched six solid innings in his return from a foot injury, and the Chicago White Sox beat the Minnesota Twins 6-2 on Sunday.	"He looked great," manager Robin Ventura said. "There is nothing else to say. It was vintage him."	Adam LaRoche homered for the second straight day and had a run-scoring single as the White Sox earned their second straight win after dropping their first four games. Alexei Ramirez also drove in two runs, including an RBI single in Chicago's three-run eighth.	Sale, who broke a bone in his right foot in an accident at home in February, threw 72 of his 98 pitches for strikes in his first start of 2015. He allowed one run and five hits, struck out eight and walked one.	"It can always get better, but definitely satisfied with what we had today," Sale said. "Felt good to get out there, face some major league hitters."	Minnesota dropped to 1-5 under new manager Paul Molitor. Danny Santana had two hits, including an RBI double, and Phil Hughes lasted six innings after getting off to a slow start.	"It's a bad week," outfielder Torii Hunter said. "You have those weeks during the season, but it just so happened to start at the beginning."	The White Sox used five straight hits to produce two runs in the first. LaRoche singled in Melky Cabrera and scored on Ramirez's double to left.	Chicago almost had another run but Jose Abreu was thrown out trying to go from first to third on LaRoche's liner to left.	The Twins got on the board when Santana doubled in Eduardo Nunez in the third, but LaRoche drove Hughes' first pitch of the bottom half into the visiting bullpen in right. LaRoche, who is adjusting to his new role as Chicago's primary designated hitter, also hit a solo shot in Saturday's 5-4 victory.	Gordon Beckham added a two-run homer in the ninth as Chicago set season highs for runs and hits (12).	"I like the way we've bounced back," Beckham said. "Yesterday wasn't a blowout win and we got down early and it kind of showed that we've got some belief in ourselves to come back and get that win. Come out today and keep that momentum going."	Sale (1-0) struck out his final two batters after Hunter reached on an infield single. The ace improved to 7-1 with a 2.37 ERA in 17 games against the Twins.	Hughes (0-2) allowed eight hits, struck out four and walked none. The right-hander also pounded the zone, recording 69 strikes in his 98 pitches.	"We need to do a better job of getting some better starts out of our guys," Hughes said. "It starts with me."	ON THE MOVE	Abreu has been taking grounders at third, and Ventura said the big first baseman could play there in an interleague game this year.	"It's a possibility," Ventura said. "He moves around very well. He's got good hands and he makes the throw fine. He's been over there. He does have that in him."	COMING HOME	After beginning the season with a six-game trip, the Twins play their home opener on Monday against Kansas City.	It will be Molitor's first game in Minnesota since he became the manager of the Twins in November. It also marks a homecoming of sorts for Hunter, who agreed to a $10.5 million, one-year contract with his first major league team in December.	"It will be a great day," Molitor said. "Obviously we're playing one game tomorrow, but it's the first time I'll have the opportunity in this role. My hometown. My home ballpark. It will be an emotional day. It will be a good day."	UP NEXT	RHP Trevor May gets the ball for Minnesota on Monday against Kansas City LHP Danny Duffy (0-0, 9.00 ERA). It's the first game of the season for May.	Chicago gets a day off before beginning a two-game set at Cleveland. White Sox LHP Jose Quintana (0-0, 9.00 ERA) faces Indians RHP Carlos Carrasco (1-0, 0.00 ERA) on Tuesday night.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

MILWAUKEE --  Andrew McCutchen was back in the Pittsburgh lineup Sunday and he made quite a difference.	McCutchen took himself out of Friday night's game because of soreness in his left knee and didn't play Saturday. In his return, he homered and drove in four runs as the Pirates routed the Milwaukee Brewers 10-2.	"He really had a nice game and drove the ball well," manager Clint Hurdle said. "He was big, but we got contributions from a lot of guys and went out and won a meaningful game to win a series."	One of those other guys was pitcher Casey Sadler (1-0), who earned his first major league win, going five innings in his first career start. He pitched in place of ace Francisco Liriano, who is on the paternity leave list.	Sadler gave up two runs and four hits, striking out five.	"He really showed a lot of poise out there," Hurdle said.	Sadler said he had a lot of fun.	"It was not a bad day," he said. "I had some great defense behind me and we were able to get an important win."	Even with his impressive showing, Sadler was returning to Triple-A Indianapolis after the game.	"I know I have to go down and keep working hard so I am ready the next time the phone rings," he said. "This was a nice, but I wanted to be up here all the time."	Pirates third baseman Jung Ho Kang got his first big league hit, a leadoff single in the seventh after starting the season 0 for 6. He is the first player to go directly from the South Korea pro league to the majors.	Hurdle said he was very happy for Kang.	"It is a much different game than it was in South Korea," he said. "We know it is going to take some time. I know he is going to help our club.	Kyle Lohse (0-2) allowed four runs and eight hits in 6 1/3 innings. He was tagged for eight runs by Colorado on opening day.	Brewers manager Ron Roenicke continued to be frustrated with the team's overall play as it dropped to 1-5.	"We have got to pitch a lot better, no question," he said. "And we need to swing the bat better."	Gregory Polanco's RBI single in the third off the glove of second baseman Hector Gomez put Pittsburgh ahead 1-0.	Carlos Gomez hit his first homer of the season, a two-run shot in the third that gave the Brewers a 2-1 lead.	Polanco began the sixth with a double off the glove of left fielder Khris Davis. After a single by Jody Mercer, McCutchen hit his second home run of the year into the Pirates' bullpen in right field.	Walker homered and McCutchen had an RBI single during a six-run ninth. Davis dropped a line drive for an error, and all six runs were unearned.	BACK MONDAY	Hurdle said Liriano would be flying to Pittsburgh on Sunday evening and was scheduled to start Wednesday against the Tigers.	LIKES MILWAUKEE	McCutchen's home run was the 22nd of his career against the Brewers, the most he's hit against any team. He had four RBIs for the eighth time in his career, the last time coming July 22, 2013, against Washington.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: Catcher Chris Stewart, out with a right hamstring strain, was expected to play his first game Sunday with Triple-A Indianapolis after playing two games with Double-A Altoona.	Brewers: RF Ryan Braun started this third straight game after missing two starts with what the team called "lower right side soreness."	UP NEXT	Pirates: The home opener is Monday against the Detroit Tigers. RHP Gerrit Cole (0-0) will be making his first career start against the Tigers, who will counter with RHP Shane Greene (1-0).	Brewers: Travel to St. Louis to face the Cardinals in their home opener. RHP Matt Garza (0-1), who has never won at Busch Stadium, will face Cardinals ace Adam Wainwright (1-0).	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- George Springer didn't need a replay to know he saved a home run with a leaping catch in the 10th inning. The video just let the Houston right fielder know how far over the fence the fly ball was.	Hank Conger followed Springer's game-saving catch with a two-run home run in the 14th inning, and the Astros beat the Texas Rangers 6-4 Sunday.	"I've seen it, so I know it was gone," Springer said of the two-out drive by Leonys Martin, which came after the Rangers wiped out a 4-0 deficit. "It was over my head for sure. It was a home run, but at the time I didn't know how far over."	Texas teammates Prince Fielder and Adrian Beltre simply stared into right field from the edge of the dugout as Springer ran in celebrating the grab.	The Rangers stranded 15 runners, included the bases loaded three times, and couldn't finish off the rally despite seven walks and four hit batters by Houston pitching. But there was a simple reason in the mind of Fielder.	"If somebody doesn't catch a game-winning grand slam," he said with a smile.	Houston left-hander Tony Sipp, who benefited from the flashy catch, was equally stunned.	"I was trying to put on my best face for TV on a walkoff," Sipp said. "I thought it was a home run. One catch turns everything."	Conger entered in the 12th inning and homered after Evan Gattis reached base for the first time this season -- on a walk in his 21st plate appearance of the year.	Robbie Grossman ran for Gattis, but it didn't matter when Conger pulled a pitch from Jason Verrett (0-1) into the second row of seats in right field.	Will Harris (1-0) retired six straight batters. He struck out the side in the 12th, his 19th consecutive scoreless outing dating to August.	Samuel Deduno loaded the bases with two outs in the bottom of the 14th but got his first big league save when Rougned Odor lined out to -- you guessed it -- Springer in right.	Deduno got two quick outs before allowing Fielder's third single, a walk and Houston's fourth hit batter -- and the second to Mitch Moreland. Plate umpire Laz Diaz ruled Moreland wasn't hit, but the call was overturned by video review.	"Couldn't get that one to kind of push us over the top," Moreland said. "Great game played by both, I think."	Martin had a two-run single in the seventh to stop an 0-for-18 skid and end Dallas Keuchel's season-opening scoreless streak at 13 2/3 innings.	After Kuechel finally faltered, the left-hander's bullpen let him down in the eighth. Joe Thatcher and Chad Qualls combined for two hit batters and two walks, allowing the Rangers to pull even.	Odor's walk against Qualls forced home the first run in the eighth, and Texas made it 4-all on a sacrifice fly by Carlos Corporan, who also had two hits in his first game against his former team.	HOUSTON'S EARLY BURST	Colby Lewis gave up four runs in the second inning, but Texas' veteran right-hander didn't allow another hit until the seventh. Luis Valbuena led off with a homer for Houston just inside the pole in right field. After Colby Rasmus tripled and scored on a double by Marwin Gonzalez, Jake Marisnick hit a two-run shot down the left-field line.	FAMILIAR FACES	Besides Corporan, the Astros also saw former first-round pick Delino DeShields make his first big-league start for Texas in left field. He had a sliding catch to start a double play in the first inning. The Rule 5 pickup was replaced in the eighth by Shin-Soo Choo, who skipped Saturday's game with back spasms.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: RHP Josh Fields (right groin strain) threw 25 pitches in a rehab assignment with Triple-A Fresno on Saturday night. After a day off, he is to pitch in consecutive games. Manager A.J. Hinch said there will be a spot in the bullpen waiting for him when he's ready. "Hopefully we have a good problem where we have too many good guys throwing well," Hinch said.	Rangers: RHP Tanner Scheppers (sprained right ankle) was ejected from a rehab appearance for Double-A Frisco on Saturday night for throwing behind Arkansas batter Eric Stamets. Manager Joe Mikulik also was ejected. Scheppers threw 21 pitches and is expected to make a few more rehab appearances.	UP NEXT	Astros: RHP Scott Feldman starts the opener of a three-game home series against Oakland. He opened the season with 6 2/3 solid innings in a 2-0 loss to Cleveland.	Rangers: LHP Ross Detwiler, acquired in an offseason trade with Washington, makes his home debut against the Los Angeles Angels. He allowed 10 hits and eight runs -- five earned -- in 4 1/3 innings in his first Texas start, a 10-0 loss to Oakland.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- The Kansas City Royals completed another three-game sweep of the Los Angeles Angels. Unlike last October, there was no champagne sprayed in the clubhouse -- just a fervent resolve to prove that last year's trip to the World Series wasn't a fluke.	Alcides Escobar and Alex Rios hit two-run doubles, Salvador Perez homered and the defending AL champions extended their season-opening win streak to six games with a 9-2 victory on Sunday.	"To start the year the way that we have is exciting and it's fun to see. You just keep it going for as long as you can," manager Ned Yost said. "Over the course of 162 games, it's hard to maintain over long stretches. But we're firing on all cylinders right now in all phases of our game.	"We're hitting in the clutch and we're hitting for power. Our defense again today was fantastic, so was the starting pitching, and our bullpen came in and did a great job. To come in here and play as well as we did against them was encouraging."	The winning streak is the Royals' second-longest to open a season. They won their first nine in 2003 under first-year manager Tony Pena, but finished only four games over .500 and third in the AL Central.	The Royals and Detroit are the only unbeaten teams left in the majors.	"We're just playing good baseball as a team," third baseman Mike Moustakas said. "Everyone is doing their job, no one's trying to do too much, and we've been finding ways to win."	"Everything's rolling pretty good for us right now," he said.	Albert Pujols hit his 522nd home run, moving past Ted Williams, Willie McCovey and Frank Thomas for sole possession of 18th on the career list. The solo drive off Royals ace Yordano Ventura (2-0) landed in the lower seats in the left-field corner.	"Obviously, it's a great accomplishment, man, but it's really disappointing," Pujols said. "We got swept by a great ballclub. I've told you guys my whole career, that at the end of my career I'm going to enjoy it a little bit more. But when I'm playing baseball, my goal is to try to help this ballclub to win."	Ventura, coming off a 10-1 win at Chicago in which he left in the seventh after 81 pitches because of a cramp in his thumb, allowed two runs and four hits in 5 2/3 innings Sunday before coming out with another cramp -- this one in his right calf.	After Pujols' homer, Ventura didn't allow another hit until Mike Trout's one-out single in the sixth. Moments later, Trout slid across the plate on Pujols' double, which center fielder Lorenzo Cain bobbled for the Royals' first error of the season.	Ventura, who was backing up home plate on the play, had some words with Trout. Both dugouts and bullpens emptied, but no punches were thrown.	"I was just playing my game," Trout said. "I just got a base hit, I got to first base and he was staring at me. I didn't think I did anything wrong -- and then he got in my face. I'm not trying to get in any fights or anything, and I'm just trying to play baseball."	Yost, understandably, defended his pitcher.	"He pitches with a lot of emotion. He's a real intense competitor, and he got fired up there," Yost said.	C.J. Wilson (1-1) allowed seven runs -- six earned -- and nine hits over 5 2/3 innings after pitching eight innings of two-hit ball in a 2-0 victory at Seattle last Tuesday. He took the loss in the finale of last year's AL Division Series, which completed the Royals' three-game sweep.	"We were able to put some good swings against him in that playoff game, but he's a good pitcher and he definitely made some adjustments against us today," Moustakas said. "We had a report on him that said he was throwing a lot of fastballs, going at guys and getting a lot of first-pitch swings, so we tried to get a good pitch to hit early in the count and get a knock."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: RF Kole Calhoun, who homered and drove in three runs in Saturday night's 6-4 loss, got the day off to rest a sore calf. "His calf is a little bit tight, so we're just going to take a precautionary day," manager Mike Scioscia said. "He's been nursing it for a couple of days, and we just don't want it to go in the wrong direction right now."	UP NEXT	Royals: LHP Danny Duffy makes his second start of the season in the opener of a three-game series at Minnesota, after giving up five runs over five innings last Wednesday in a no-decision at Chicago.	Angels: RHP Matt Shoemaker, coming off a 5-3 victory at Seattle in which he allowed three runs over six innings, makes his second start of the season on Monday at Texas. He is 3-0 with a 1.80 ERA in three career starts against the Rangers.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  Rickie Weeks stayed ready on the bench and Nelson Cruz kept his power stroke going.	The Seattle Mariners left Oakland with a pair of extra-inning wins and showed off some nice pop from their slugging newcomers in the process. On a rare off day by ace Felix Hernandez against the Athletics nonetheless. On a day they were no-hit through five.	Cruz connected for the second straight game, hitting a tiebreaking solo drive in the 10th inning, and Weeks had an earlier pinch-hit, three-run homer that helped send Seattle past the A's 8-7 on Sunday.	"On several different accounts today we probably should have lost that game," manager Lloyd McClendon said. "It's the type of game where it's easy to lay down and say, `OK, we'll get them tomorrow."	Hernandez left after five innings as a precaution because of tightness in his right quadriceps that made it tough to push off and generate momentum from his legs. He felt that in the third inning after tweaking his left ankle in the first. He said he "100 percent" will make his next start and has no concerns.	"No I'm not, not at all," he said. "I believe in these guys. This offense is pretty good. I know it's going to click. It's a different look. We're a different team. We can score different ways. We can score with a homer, we can score with speed. We look pretty good."	Seattle took a 7-3 lead into the ninth before Oakland rallied to tie it against closer Fernando Rodney.	Cruz connected off new A's closer Tyler Clippard (0-1) for his second homer this season. Cruz led the majors with 40 home runs last year for Baltimore, then signed with the Mariners.	"That's what we're here for, to pick up one another. Sometimes the offense is going to be there, and (sometimes) the pitchers will pick us up," Cruz said. "It showed a lot of heart from everybody."	Rodney (1-0) wound up with the win and Yoervis Medina finished for his first save in nearly two years.	The Mariners were held hitless by Jesse Hahn until Dustin Ackley doubled off the right field wall to begin the sixth. Seattle won despite getting outhit 14-7.	"It happened in a hurry there in the sixth," A's manager Bob Melvin said. "But early on, I don't know how much better you can pitch."	Sam Fuld hit a two-run double off Rodney and Oakland loaded the bases with no outs. After McClendon went to the mound, Billy Butler grounded into a double play that brought home a run and pinch hitter Eric Sogard tied it with a single.	Weeks hit a three-run homer in the seventh that put Seattle ahead 7-3. It was the third of his career.	Hernandez got a little help to stay unbeaten at the Oakland Coliseum over the last six years.	Former Gold Glove right fielder Josh Reddick, making his season debut off the disabled list, dropped a sharp liner for a two-run error that allowed the Mariners to tie it at 3 in the sixth.	Hernandez gave up three runs and eight hits in five innings. He is 6-0 at the Coliseum and has won four of his last six starts with a 2.87 ERA over 13 outings at the stadium since April 11, 2009.	Hahn, the 25-year-old righty acquired in a trade that sent All-Star catcher Derek Norris to the Padres, allowed only one earned run and three hits in 5 2/3 innings, struck out two and walked two.	After starting the first six games in the outfield, Ben Zobrist played second base for the A's.	RODNEY'S DAY	McClendon promises to go to his closer with a four-run lead all season.	"You're a fool if you don't put your closer in with a four-run lead," he said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: Hernandez was checked on by athletic trainer Rick Griffin and McClendon in the fifth but he stayed in the game.	Athletics: LHP Sean Doolittle, on the DL with a shoulder injury, threw from 90 feet for the third time and will move to 105 feet on Tuesday for three sessions. Then, it'll be 120 feet three times and after that likely progress to off the mound.	UP NEXT	Mariners: LHP James Paxton (0-1) tries again for his first win as the Mariners continue their road trip against the Angels.	Athletics: Lefty Scott Kazmir (1-0) pitches at Houston in the opener of a 10-game road trip after combining on a 10-0 shutout of Texas last Wednesday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN DIEGO --  Thirteen years after making his major league debut by catching Jake Peavy, Wil Nieves collected another career milestone that involved Peavy.	This one was worth the long wait.	A 37-year-old backup catcher, Nieves hit his first career grand slam, a fourth-inning drive off Peavy that helped carry the San Diego Padres over the San Francisco Giants 6-4 Sunday.	"It couldn't come at a better time than today," Nieves said. "It was awesome just to contribute with my bat today."	Nieves also got the first curtain call of his career from the crowd of 40,184, which saw the Padres win their third straight in the four-game series.	Nieves was a 47th-round draft pick of the Padres in 1995. He made his big league debut on July 21, 2002, when he caught Peavy and got his first hit, a single off Arizona's Randy Johnson.	After a roundabout journey that included stints with six other big league clubs and numerous minor league teams, he signed a minor league contract with San Diego in January.	"The only thing I can control is my attitude," he said. "I worked really hard in the offseason to be in good shape so whatever team I signed with, I wanted to be my best."	He won the backup job after Tim Federowicz, obtained from the Dodgers in the Matt Kemp deal, was sidelined following knee surgery.	With Derek Norris given a day off after catching six straight games, Nieves got his first start. He homered to left on a 1-1 pitch with two outs in the fourth. Peavy (0-1), whose first start of the season was delayed because of a back injury, loaded the bases on a single by Kemp, a walk to Justin Upton and a one-out single by Will Middlebrooks.	"I know my No. 1 job when I'm catching is just to call a good game. To contribute with the bat is a plus," Nieves said. "It's been a while since I've had an at-bat but I've been working really hard."	Nieves said he still loves baseball despite bouncing around the majors and minors.	"A lot of stuff happened to me in my career that I don't think I deserved, but I'm doing what I love and not a lot of people can say that. Once again I'm blessed I can put a uniform on one more year and hopefully, I want to play, three, four more years," he said.	Peavy said the cut fastball to Nieves "came right out of the top of my hand and just didn't do much.	"It was just that one pitch," Peavy said. "You could go back and look at the game and there it is, the one pitch.  I wasn't sharp by any means in that inning but we got soft contact. I just wasn't able to avoid a couple of outs and made a bad pitch to Nieves, obviously."	Peavy, the unanimous 2007 NL Cy Young Award winner while with the Padres, allowed four runs and four hits in four innings, struck out five and walked three.	San Diego's Tyson Ross (1-0) allowed three runs and five hits in six innings, struck out eight and walked four. Craig Kimbrel pitched the ninth for his second save in as many chances.	The Giants had given Peavy a 2-0 lead on Matt Duffy's RBI single in the second and Brandon Belt's RBI hit in the third.  Belt had missed four games with a strained right groin.	Gregor Blanco's RBI triple down the right-field line in the sixth pulled the Giants to 4-3 before Alexi Amarista's RBI triple into the left-field corner in the bottom of the inning gave the Padres a two-run lead.	Buster Posey homered off Dale Thayer with two outs in the seventh, his second, to pull the Giants to 5-4. San Diego's Will Venable homered in the seventh, his first.	ATTENDANCE	The series drew 168,171 fans, the highest attendance for a four-game series since Petco Park opened in 2004.	TRAINERS ROOM	Giants: 3B Casey McGehee said an MRI showed he has a bone bruise in his left knee. He had a cortisone shot and is expected to be out a few days.  "All things considered I feel real fortunate. It's as good of news as I could hope for," McGehee said. He said he suffered the injury Monday against Arizona and aggravated it during an at-bat in the first inning Saturday.	UP NEXT	Giants: RHP Chris Heston (1-0, 0.00 ERA) will become the second rookie in San Francisco history to start a home opener when he faces Colorado on Monday. The Rockies counter with Eddie Butler (0-0, 3.18)	Padres: Andrew Cashner (0-1, 9.00) is scheduled to start Monday night when the Padres open a three-game series against Arizona, which counters with Rubby De La Rosa (1-0, 10.13).	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PHOENIX --  Alex Guerrero was in the lineup after two players were injured in a span of two pitches the previous night.	He got his first RBI in the big leagues, added another, hit his first homer in the majors and played solid defense for nine innings.	Not a bad first day in the starting lineup.	Guerrero homered and had four RBIs, Zack Greinke pitched seven strong innings and the Los Angeles Dodgers avoided a three-game sweep with a 7-4 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Sunday.	"He's been hitting since all last spring, all last year -- he can hit," Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said. "Our biggest fear was defensively, how he looked last year, but he's been good all through spring."	The Dodgers had two hits in a shutout loss to the Diamondbacks Saturday night, but were swinging the bats well in the series finale, hitting balls over the wall and all over the ballpark.	Guerrero, in the starting lineup after injuries to Justin Turner and Juan Uribe, finished 3 for 5 with a two-run homer off Oliver Perez in the eighth inning. Yasiel Puig hit his first homer of 2015 off Josh Collmenter (0-2) in the fifth inning. Joc Pederson had his first big league homer and three of Los Angeles' 16 hits.	Greinke (1-0) was sharp in his second straight start to open the season, allowing five hits and striking out seven a day after the Diamondbacks roughed up reigning NL Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw.	"I thought Zack was really what we kind of needed today," Mattingly said.	The Diamondbacks fought back after Greinke left.	They loaded the bases in the ninth inning off Chris Hatcher, setting up a three-run double by A.J. Pollock and Jordan Pacheco's RBI single. Ender Inciarte fought off several good pitches in an attempt to keep the rally going, but eventually flied out off Joel Peralta, who earned his second save.	"The guys battled it was good; that's the attitude we have," Diamondbacks manager Chip Hale. "It doesn't matter what the score is or the situation we are going to battle to the end, 27 outs, offensively or defensively."	Greinke pitched well in his opening start on Tuesday, allowing a run and two hits against San Diego. He ended up with a no-decision after the Dodgers' bullpen allowed six runs over the final three innings for a 7-3 loss.	Greinke was good again, allowing one runner to reach second base while hitting his spots and keeping the Diamondbacks off-balance.	"I tried to make good pitches and make the other team adjust," Greinke said. "That was the plan, to kind of mix it up."	Puig broke out of his early season slump with one big swing.	The Cuban slugger sat on the bench for Saturday's game against Arizona after opening the season 2 for 17. Puig hit a foul ball into the second deck in his third at-bat against Collmenter and straightened it out two pitches later, lining a leadoff homer to left in the fifth inning to put Los Angeles up 3-0.	Collmenter struggled after getting the ball on opening day for the first time, allowing five runs and 10 hits in 4 2/3 innings against San Francisco.	He continued to scuffle against the Dodgers, though worked through traffic to limit them to three runs and nine hits in five innings. Jimmy Rollins had a sacrifice fly in the third inning and Guerrero got his first big league RBI with a run-scoring single in the fourth.	"I've got to make better pitches," Collmenter said. "Even the ones that aren't getting a lot of the bat, they are getting enough of it so I have to put them in a better location."	STATS	Arizona 2B Chris Owings snapped a 0-for-14 streak to start the season with his ninth-inning, pinch-hit double. ... Dodgers 1B Adrian Gonzalez is 17 for 26 with seven homers and 11 RBIs during a seven-game hitting streak dating to last season.	TRAINERS' ROOM	Dodgers: Mattingly did not expect Uribe (hamstring) and Turner (cut finger) to be out more than a few days.	Diamondbacks: Arizona placed catcher Gerald Laird on the 15-day disabled list with lower-back spasms, retroactive to April 9. He was scheduled to start Saturday against the Dodgers, but starter Tuffy Gosewich had to play after Laird's back flared up.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: RHP Brandon McCarthy will make his second start for the Dodgers against Seattle on Monday. He allowed four runs and nine hits in five innings against San Diego in his debut on Wednesday.	Diamondbacks: RHP Rubby De La Rosa will start the opener of a three-game series against the Padres on Monday after winning his Arizona debut.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

NEW YORK -- Alex Rodriguez has had some startling success early in his return from a yearlong suspension.	After New York's breakout night in the Bronx, A-Rod thinks the Yankees are ready to surprise some people around the major leagues, too.	Rodriguez had a three-run double in a seven-run first-inning outburst, and the Yankees broke out the bats and avoided their worst start in more than 25 years with a 14-4 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Sunday night.	Chase Headley and Stephen Drew had consecutive homers as a New York lineup that entered hitting .193 throttled Clay Buchholz (1-1) to avoid a three-game sweep and win for just the second time in six games.	"I think overall it's good to see one through nine come out and get some good at-bats, get some hits," Rodriguez said. "I think this is a game that we needed.''	Masahiro Tanaka survived one wild stretch to earn his first victory and with five solid innings somewhat put to rest concern about his right elbow.	Brian McCann hit his 200th career homer in the eighth, Rodriguez walked with the bases loaded for a fourth RBI and Headley added a run-scoring single for New York, which had 16 hits. Carlos Beltran, who entered 2-for-20, singled twice, and Brett Gardner had a two-run single. Every Yankees starter had a hit and scored a run.	"We know we have a really good offense in here," McCann said.	The Red Sox were hoping to match their best start since 2006 at 5-1. Instead, they fell flat heading into Monday's home opener against Washington.	"Two road series wins for us and now we go home. Looking forward to the opener tomorrow and getting back in front of our fans,'' manager John Farrell said.	Tanaka (1-1) looked a whole lot more impressive than he did on Opening Day through three innings, mixing in more fastballs -- topping out at 92 mph. He retired nine of his first 11 batters, allowing one hit and a walk.	But he lost control in a 38-pitch fourth, throwing two wild pitches and 17 balls as the Red Sox scored three times. Xander Bogaerts had a two-run double for one of Boston's two hits in the inning.	"I thought he was better with his fastball, but he didn't throw as many strikes with his off-speed as he did; it was the opposite,'' manager Joe Girardi said. "The next step is to put them both together and we'll have Tanaka."	Overall, Tanaka allowed four hits and four runs -- three earned. He struck out four and walked three.	Girardi called this an important game for the Yankees -- they last opened the season 1-5 in 1989 -- before a stretch in which they play 25 of 35 on the road.	The Yankees hadn't even had a hit in the first inning through five games, but on Sunday they had their highest-scoring first inning against the Red Sox since putting up eight runs on Aug. 15, 1954.	Batting sixth, Rodriguez came up with the bases loaded and drilled a liner into the gap in left-center. Buchholz kicked at the cleats cleaner on the back of the mound after McCann scored from first.	Headley followed with a two-run shot and, two pitches later, Drew connected for a 7-0 lead.	"It was fun," Headley said. "It takes the burden off."	Hanley Ramirez hit his third homer, a solo shot off Tanaka in the fifth, and added a sacrifice fly.	The Yankees chased Buchholz with one out in the fourth after Mark Teixeira's sacrifice fly made it 10-3.	Buchholz yielded 10 runs -- nine earned -- nine hits and two walks.	"Felt good with all of my pitches. The command was a little off at first, but after that I felt really good," Buchholz said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: Farrell said Koji Uehara (left hamstring strain) should rejoin the team on Monday after his successful minor league rehab outing Saturday. Farrell said Uehara will step right back into his role as closer, too.	Yankees: Girardi said before the game he wasn't concerned about the slow start for Beltran, who had offseason elbow surgery. "There's nothing that I see that's necessarily [wrong] -- does his bat speed look different to me? No,'' Girardi said. "Just he's gotten off to a slow start, and hopefully the consistent at-bats will get him going."	UP NEXT	Red Sox: Rick Porcello (0-1), acquired from Detroit in December and signed to a four-year, $82.5 million contract last week, will start against Jordan Zimmermann (1-0).	Yankees: Michael Pineda makes his second start of the season, at Baltimore. He is 1-0 with a 1.78 ERA against the Orioles in four starts.	RETRIEVAL SERVICE	Yankees outfielder Chris Young did a good deed for McCann: He retrieved the catcher's milestone home run ball from the fan in right field when he ran out to his position for the start of the ninth inning. It was a "mad hustle to make it happen," Young said. "The fans were amazing." Young said six or seven fans helped track down the person who caught ball. He gave the fan a ball autographed by McCann in exchange for the keepsake.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

NEW YORK -- Even without his sharpest stuff, Jacob deGrom got the Mets off to a successful start at home.	He also gave Matt Harvey a nice round number to match: zero.	The reigning NL Rookie of the Year, deGrom pitched into the seventh inning as New York beat the Philadelphia Phillies 2-0 Monday to win its home opener.	"It was a lot of fun. I was looking forward to it ever since they announced it," deGrom said. "My offspeed wasn't really that good and I was having a hard time locating my fastball, so I really had to bear down mentally."	Juan Lagares drove in a run with an infield single, Travis d'Arnaud added a sacrifice fly and the Mets improved to 34-20 in home openers, including 4-3 at Citi Field. They've won 18 of their last 24 games against NL East rival Philadelphia.	New York scratched out just enough offense against Aaron Harang and the Phillies' bullpen to make a winner of deGrom (1-1), one day before Harvey gets the ball for his first home start since August 2013.	"I've seen him enough to know that there's a lot more in there," Mets manager Terry Collins said of deGrom. "So it's good to get this one out of the way. Now we get to see the big boy tomorrow. That'll be fun."	The shaggy-haired deGrom gave up seven hits in 6 1/3 innings before a sellout crowd of 43,947 that included Jerry Seinfeld, Larry David and Matthew Broderick. The only time more fans packed the park was the 2013 All-Star Game started by Harvey.	"Well, we've been doing a lot of yapping about how this team can compete. And our fan base said, `OK, we're going to come and see it.' So today was a big step forward for us," Collins said. "Hope the guys enjoyed it, because we hope to fill this place again this summer, for sure."	Second baseman Daniel Murphy made a nice defensive play to help Carlos Torres pitch out of a seventh-inning jam. And with the Mets on their third closer since opening day last year, Jeurys Familia got a double-play ball in the ninth and earned his second save.	Murphy doubled to right with one out in the fourth -- a male fan sprayed his drink over Grady Sizemore as he neared the screened fence -- and advanced when d'Arnaud flied out to right.	Lagares then hit a comebacker that was knocked down by a twisting Harang (1-1). But the 36-year-old righty stumbled awkwardly for a moment on the mound and was slow to retrieve the ball. By the time he threw to first, Lagares beat the play for an RBI single.	"Spikes got caught," Harang said. "I just caught it right off the end of my glove. Another 1/8 of an inch and it's in my web and I'm able to just set and turn and throw."	New York added a run in the eighth after Murphy's hard one-hopper, which could have been turned into an inning-ending double play, went through the legs of second baseman Chase Utley for an error.	Michael Cuddyer scored and had two hits in his first home game for the Mets, including a fly-ball triple that Sizemore lost in the sun.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: A trainer and manager Ryne Sandberg came out to check Harang after Lagares' run-scoring single. Harang took a long breather but stayed in the game without trying a warmup pitch.	Mets: GM Sandy Alderson said he expects right-handed relievers Vic Black (shoulder tendinitis) and Bobby Parnell (elbow surgery) to begin rehab assignments with Class A St. Lucie in the next day or two. ... Alderson said top pitching prospect Noah Syndergaard was examined a while back after feeling tightness in his arm during spring training. Syndergaard had an MRI and everything checked out fine, Alderson said. ... The GM was asked about closer Jenrry Mejia, already on the disabled list with elbow inflammation when he was suspended for 80 games Saturday following a positive test for the steroid Stanozolol. "As you can imagine -- disappointed, unhappy. Big mistake. But that's not going to slow us down," Alderson said. "He knows he made a mistake. He's paying a price. We're paying a price, and we're moving on."	NEW LOOK	After the Mets brought in the Citi Field fences last winter for a second time, the shorter dimensions in right-center never really came into play.	UP NEXT	Phillies: RHP David Buchanan (0-1) starts Tuesday night. He is 0-2 with a 3.38 ERA in three starts against the Mets.	Mets: Harvey, coming back from Tommy John surgery, is 4-0 with a 1.08 ERA in five starts against the Phillies. ... The Mets began a stretch with 19 of 22 games in New York, including three at Yankee Stadium.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

MINNEAPOLIS -- Kansas City has picked up right where it left off. Behind some torrid hitting and an impenetrable bullpen, the Royals are the only unbeaten team left in the majors.	Danny Duffy pitched into the seventh inning and Kendrys Morales homered in a 12-3 romp over the Minnesota Twins on Monday, moving the defending AL champions to 7-0 for the second-best start in Kansas City's history behind the 2003 club that won nine in a row to begin the season.	"There's a great mix here of young and veteran players that feed off each other," Morales said. "The young players got a lot of energy, which helps the experienced players. It's a real good clubhouse."	Detroit was the only other undefeated team left until a 5-4 loss at Pittsburgh earlier in the day.	Duffy (1-0) went 6 1/3 innings, giving up three runs. He is 4-1 with a 2.37 ERA in his career against the Twins and is undefeated in four starts at Target Field.	"It's a long season," Duffy said. "Obviously you hear that every day, but we're just kind of keeping it all in front of us."	The Twins were better off with a put-it-all-behind-them approach.	"We didn't play Twins baseball. I don't know what we played. Bad News Bears baseball, I guess," right fielder Torii Hunter said. "Just got to do better."	The Twins lost their fourth straight home opener, though they still packed the place with an over-capacity crowd of 40,123 on a 61-degree day. Hunter tipped his helmet to acknowledge the standing ovation during his first at-bat, but the cheers were scant the rest of the afternoon.	The Twins used four pitchers in a six-run eighth by the Royals, who did their damage on only two singles to accompany three walks, two hit batters, an error and a passed ball. Shortstop Danny Santana let a bases-loaded grounder bounce out of his glove with no outs.	Hunter was charged with a throwing error in the sixth, too, letting a run score. New manager Paul Molitor has so far had his hands full.	"We're trying to find a way to put an offense together that's a little more consistent. So far it really hasn't clicked too well," Molitor said.	The Royals have sure been rolling. Alcides Escobar, Lorenzo Cain on his 29th birthday and Eric Hosmer each drove in two runs for Kansas City, which had five players tally two hits apiece. Manager Ned Yost was asked afterward what has stood out from his team's strong start.	"Their energy. Their focus. Their intensity," Yost said. "They're just a real confident group."	The bullpen hasn't been scored on yet, either, with 21 strikeouts in 19 innings.	POWER SURGE	Morales, who failed to hit a home run in 67 plate appearances at Target Field during his stint with the Twins last summer, sent an 0-1 pitch from Trevor May (0-1) in the second inning into the upper deck above right-center field.	The scary part for the rest of the league is that the Royals, last in the majors in home runs last season, have gone deep 10 times already. Salvador Perez has nine RBIs and Alex Rios and Cain each have eight. The Twins have 14 total RBIs; no one has more than two.	NO REST YET	One of Yost's stated priorities this season was to limit Perez's workload, after the All-Star catcher's production waned during the playoffs last year. He hasn't had a day off yet, along with every other regular but left fielder Alex Gordon.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals: Rios was hit on the left hand by J.R. Graham's first pitch in the eighth. He eventually scored but was removed as a precaution in the bottom of the inning and sent for X-rays. Yost said he was encouraged by the strength test Rios took and believed he would be all right.	Twins: RHP Casey Fien, who has logged only one inning this season because of shoulder stiffness, was available to pitch.	UP NEXT	There is no game Tuesday, with the series resuming Wednesday night.	Edinson Volquez will take the mound, looking to match a sparkling debut with the Royals. The right-hander has faced the Twins only once, in 2007 when Joe Mauer homered against him in a no-decision at the Metrodome.	Kyle Gibson will start for the Twins, coming off a rough first turn at Detroit. Gibson has beaten the Royals more than any other team, carrying a 3-0 record and 1.40 ERA in three starts against them.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

ST. LOUIS --  Matt Garza struggled with control woes, issuing five walks. Shortstop Jean Segura had trouble getting his throws to first and Ryan Braun couldn't quite pull off a shoestring catch.	Warts and all, the Milwaukee Brewers did just enough to spoil the St. Louis Cardinals' home opener.	"It was kind of an ugly win," manager Ron Roenicke said after a 5-4 victory on Monday. "Right now, it's a win."	Carlos Gomez had two hits and an RBI for the Brewers, coming off a 1-5 opening home stand but far from desperate.	"It's only seven games," Gomez said. "You see the Red Sox in 2013, they lost 11 games straight and they won the World Series."	Adam Wainwright (1-1) started his fourth opener at 10-year-old Busch Stadium and gave up five runs -- three earned -- in seven innings. Jhonny Peralta had two hits, including a two-run double off Jeremy Jeffress that cut the deficit to a run in the seventh.	"I would say that I was kind of a mixed bag," Wainwright said. "I wouldn't say those were a lot of bad pitches, they were just predictable pitches in counts when they were guessing inside or outside."	Francisco Rodriguez earned his first save, helping himself with the defensive play of the game when he reached behind his head and snared Peralta's liner leading off the ninth. Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said he was "looking in the outfield" for a line-drive hit.	"I just threw my glove up there and I find one, that's all," Rodriguez said. "To tell you I see the ball coming off the bat, I didn't. I don't know if it was going to hit my face or not but I think it was real close."	Play was sloppy with Segura and Cardinals second baseman Kolten Wong committing two errors apiece.	Jeffress' wild pitch put both runners in scoring position ahead of Peralta's double, which scooted past Braun's attempt at a running catch.	Segura doubled off the outstretched glove of new Cardinals right fielder Jason Heyward, who might have taken an indirect route to the ball, to set up Scooter Gennett's run-scoring groundout for a 2-0 lead in the second.	A double by Gomez that made it 4-2 in the seventh was the first RBI hit for the either team. Gomez made it a three-run cushion when he scored from second on Jonathan Lucroy's infield hit combined with Wong's wild throw to first.	Garza allowed two runs -- one earned -- in 5 2/3 innings to win for the first time in six career starts in St. Louis. He entered 0-2 with a 6.95 ERA.	Wainwright beat the Cubs in the season opener and had won six consecutive regular-season decisions since losing to Pittsburgh on Aug. 27.	The highlight of the pregame ceremony was a video memorial to Oscar Taveras, the promising outfielder killed along with his girlfriend in an automobile accident last fall. St. Louis uniforms include a patch on the left sleeve with the initials of the 22-year-old Taveras.	"That was as choked-up as I've ever been on a baseball field," Wainwright said.	Cardinals favorites clad in red jackets rode atop convertibles during the traditional pregame procession around the warning track. Hall of Famers Bob Gibson, Lou Brock and Ozzie Smith led the parade that also included former managers Tony La Russa and Whitey Herzog.	"I've never seen that many trucks on the field," Gomez said.	Standing room attendance of 49,875 was the largest at Busch Stadium.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: Backup catcher Tony Cruz was activated from the paternity leave list prior to the game and catcher Ed Easley was optioned to Triple-A Memphis.	UP NEXT	Brewers: Wily Peralta (0-0, 2.57) allowed two earned runs in seven innings his first time out in a 10-inning loss to Colorado. He was 3-1 with a 2.18 ERA in five starts against St. Louis last year.	Cardinals: Lance Lynn (0-1, 1.50) makes his 99th career start and will be seeking his 50th win. He was 2-0 with a 1.80 in four starts against Milwaukee last year.	OFF TARGET	Garza's five walks in 5 2/3 innings were one off his career worst. Brewers pitchers totaled seven walks, fewest in the majors, their first six games.	Wong scored from first to tie it at 2 in the fourth when Segura overthrew first base going for a double play on a bunt by Wainwright.	STREAKING	Adam Lind has reached safely in all seven games. Matt Carpenter was 1 for 12 against Garza before doubling to start the third.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

BALTIMORE --  The circumstances that brought Stephen Drew to the plate with the bases loaded were highly unusual.	What he did next was something the New York Yankees hadn't experienced in 14 seasons.	Drew delivered a pinch-hit grand slam in the seventh inning, and Yankees beat the Baltimore Orioles 6-5 Monday night for their first winning streak of the season.	Down 4-2, New York used a single, a walk and an infield hit to load the bases with two outs. Drew then stepped in for Brett Gardner, who hurt his right wrist in the first inning after being hit by a pitch from Wei-Yin Chen.	"I asked him each at-bat and he said he was OK," manager Joe Girardi said of Gardner. "Then, he came to me the last time and said, `We need a big hit and I don't know how well I can swing."	Girardi summoned Drew, who was 0 for 5 lifetime against Hunter.	"He's not a batter that is used to pinch hitting a lot and he's not used to DHing, so for him it's kind of different," Girardi said.	Drew sent a 3-1 pitch over the wall in right-center -- his second homer in two games and New York's first pinch-hit slam since Jorge Posada did it in 2001 against the Orioles.	"You got three guys on and I was not trying to do too much," Drew said. "I got ahead with a 3-1 count. I got in a good situation and it all worked out for the best."	Not for Hunter.	"The ball was up," he said. "A dink hit here, a dink hit there. And, you know, pop. Four runs."	X-rays on Gardner's wrist were negative.	"It's kind of a day-to-day thing," he said.	Chris Young and Mark Teixeira also homered for the Yankees, who have won two straight following a 1-4 start.	"That's what I like. They've been resilient so far," Girardi said. "We didn't get off to the start that we wanted. We didn't play well the first five games of the season. We played much better the last two. We've gotten big hits. We've capitalized on some mistakes the other clubs have made."	Adam Jones had three hits, including a home run, for Baltimore. Jones is 10 for 14 with three homers and seven RBIs in his last four games.	Michael Pineda (1-0) gave up five runs and nine hits with nine strikeouts in 6 1/3 innings for the Yankees, who were 6-13 against Baltimore last year.	Former Oriole Andrew Miller got the last five outs for his second save.	Playing on the road for the first time since his return from a one-year drug suspension, New York's Alex Rodriguez was booed soundly before the game and prior to each trip to the plate.	He played errorless ball at third base -- his first time at the position since Sept. 10, 2013 -- but went 0 for 4 at the plate with two strikeouts.	After Young hit a solo shot in the second inning, the Orioles got RBI doubles from Manny Machado and Jonathan Schoop in the bottom half.	Teixeira tied it with a towering fourth-inning drive into the left field seats. In the sixth, Jones hit a shot into the Baltimore bullpen for a 4-2 lead.	After Drew put the Yankees ahead, the Orioles got a run in the bottom of the seventh and loaded the bases with two outs before Chris Davis struck out for the fourth time.	REPLAY READY	Yankees: Girardi lost a challenge when Gardner was ruled out on a close play at first base in the fifth. It was the Yankees' second unsuccessful challenge in two tries after they had an 82.1 percent success rate last year -- best in the majors.	Orioles: The Orioles won their lone challenge, getting an out call on Schoop reversed on his second-inning double.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: INF Jose Pirela missed a seventh game while on the 7-day concussion disabled list. Girardi offered no timetable for Pirela's return.	Orioles: OF David Lough (hamstring) was activated from the 15-day DL and RH Eddie Gamboa was optioned to Triple-A Norfolk.	ON DECK	Yankees: CC Sabathia (0-1, 6.35 ERA) gets his second start Tuesday night, looking to bolster his 18-6 lifetime record against the Orioles.	Orioles: Miguel Gonzalez (0-1, 1.59 ERA) makes his home debut after going 7-2 at Camden Yards in 2014.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

TORONTO --  After Jake Odorizzi gave the Tampa Bay Rays eight impressive innings, a pivotal double play in the ninth made sure his efforts didn't go to waste.	Odorizzi earned his second win and the Rays scored on consecutive bases-loaded walks issued by R.A. Dickey to beat the Toronto Blue Jays 2-1 Monday night, Tampa Bay's third straight victory.	"It's great right now to get that roll going," Odorizzi said.	The Rays improved to 3-10 all-time in opponent's home openers, sending a sellout crowd of 48,414 home unhappy.	Waving rally towels, the crowd briefly came alive after Jose Bautista walked to begin the ninth, but quieted down quickly when Bautista was thrown out trying to steal second as Edwin Encarnacion struck out swinging on a full-count pitch.	"Unbelievable play," Rays manager Kevin Cash said. "That might have been as big a play as we've had so far this season."	Josh Donaldson followed by flying out to the warning track in right for the final out.	"In this stadium you never know with a ball going in the air," said Rays closer Brad Boxberger, who posted his third save.	Odorizzi, who allowed one run and two hits, is 2-0 with a 2.00 ERA in four career starts against the Blue Jays. The right-hander set down the final eight batters he faced.	"I can't say enough," Cash said. "They had some opportunities and put us in a bind a little bit but he just really stepped it up."	After Desmond Jennings and Allan Dykstra singled to begin the fourth, Dickey (0-1) retired the next two batters but then walked three in a row, including 3-2 passes to David DeJesus and Steven Souza.	"They did a good job of laying off some really close pitches and I didn't make the big pitch when I had to," Dickey said.	They were the fifth and sixth bases loaded walks for the Rays this season. Entering play Monday, the 29 other major league teams had combined for eight.	Odorizzi held Toronto hitless through the first 4 2/3 innings before Kevin Pillar doubled on a shallow flyball that bounced past a diving Souza in right. Devon Travis followed with an RBI single.	It was the first run allowed this season by Odorizzi, who pitched 6 2/3 scoreless innings in an April 8 victory over Baltimore.	Odorizzi issued two-out walks to Bautista and Encarnacion in the first, with both runners advancing on a wild pitch. Donaldson struck out looking to end the threat.	That was the first of 12 straight outs for Odorizzi, who didn't allow another baserunner until Pillar's double.	Dickey allowed two runs and three hits in six innings, walked five and struck out six. The knuckleballer hadn't walked five since an April 17 loss at Minnesota last season. He walked five or more twice in 34 starts in 2014.	TURF TALK	Reviews were mixed on Toronto's new artificial turf surface, which plays much slower than the one it replaced. "It appeared as if the ball was never getting to you," Cash said. When Rays shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera fielded a grounder in the third, he ended up with a piece of rubber fill in his eye and needed attention from the trainer. On the plus side, the new turf has no shortage of cushion. "Feels good on my feet," Blue Jays outfielder Dalton Pompey said. "Definitely softer."	ALL STAR HOSTS AGAIN?	Commissioner Rob Manfred was on hand for Toronto's opener, and he said beforehand that the Blue Jays could be in line to host the All-Star game for the first time since 1991. "There's no reason why Toronto couldn't be competitive bidder for an All-Star game in the fairly near future," Manfred said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: LH Drew Smyly (left shoulder) will make his second rehab appearance at Class-A Charlotte on Tuesday. ... LH Jake McGee (elbow surgery) threw 30 pitches of live batting practice at extended spring training Monday.	Blue Jays: OF Michael Saunders (left knee) got the day off after feeling soreness in his right hamstring during Sunday's rehab game at Class-A Dunedin. Saunders is expected to DH on Tuesday.	UP NEXT	Rays RH Matt Andriese makes his first career start against Toronto on Tuesday. Andriese will be the 25th different pitcher to start for the Rays since 2008, the fewest in baseball over that span. He's Tampa Bay's fourth rookie starter in the first eight games of the season. The Blue Jays counter with LH rookie Daniel Norris (1-0, 4.76).	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ATLANTA --  Instead of waiting for home runs, the Braves are finding different ways to manufacture runs -- and win games.	Alberto Callaspo hit a tiebreaking single in Atlanta's two-run fifth inning and the Braves held off Miami in the ninth to beat the Marlins 3-2 on Monday night in a game slowed by two rain delays.	A single by pinch-hitter Jace Peterson and double by Eric Young Jr. knocked Marlins starter Matt Latos (0-2) out of the game in the fifth. Callaspo hit Sam Dyson's first pitch to center field to drive in Peterson for a 2-1 lead. Nick Markakis followed with another run-scoring single.	"When you get contributions from everybody on the roster, whether they start the game or not, it's going to make for a special team and a very fun summer," Young said.	The Braves have hit only four homers in seven games.	Shelby Miller (1-0) allowed one run in five innings as the Braves bounced back from their first loss.	The Marlins suffered their sixth loss in seven games.	"We're going through a funk as a team, and we've got to dig deep and figure out a way to get something going," Marlins manager Mike Redmond said.	Before the game, the Marlins placed opening-day starter Henderson Alvarez on the 15-day disabled list with inflammation in his right shoulder and elbow.	Jason Grilli gave up a double to Martin Prado to open the ninth before striking out Michael Morse and Marcell Ozuna. After walking Jarrod Saltalamacchia, Grilli gave up a run-scoring single to Adeiny Hechavarria. Grilli struck out Jeff Baker on a called third strike to earn his fourth save.	The start of the game was delayed 52 minutes by rain. There was another delay of 39 minutes in the middle of the fourth.	Miller helped Atlanta's bullpen by returning for another inning following the fourth-inning delay.	"That was a big inning, another inning the bullpen didn't have to give up," Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez said.	After walking Dee Gordon, Jim Johnson struck out Christian Yelich and Giancarlo Stanton to end the eighth.	Latos allowed three runs, two earned, on five hits and three walks in four-plus innings.	The Braves pulled even in the fourth with Christian Bethancourt singled, stole second, advanced to third on Saltalamacchia's throwing error and scored on a wild pitch from Latos.	Stanton, who was 0-for-4, is hitting .130 with no homers.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: Backup catcher Jeff Mathis and reserve infielder Don Kelly landed on the 15-day DL. Each broke the ring finger on his right hand in Sunday's game. ... Right-hander Jose Urena was recalled from Triple-A New Orleans to replace Phelps. Also coming up from New Orleans were catcher J.T. Realmuto, infielder Reid Brignac and right-hander Carter Capps, who pitched the eighth inning.	GLOVE WORK	Yelich took a run-scoring hit away from Cameron Maybin in the second. With runners on first and second, Yelich made a leaping catch of Maybin's line drive in left field and held the ball as he tumbled onto the warning track. A video review confirmed the catch.	WALKS NOT ALLOWED	Before the game, the Braves designated right-hander Juan Jaime for assignment and selected the contract of right-hander Sugar Ray Marimon from Triple-A Gwinnett. Jaime walked four while getting four outs in his first two games.	Gonzalez said the move was made because "you need somebody in the game who throws strikes."	UP NEXT	Marlins: RHP Tom Koehler will look for his first win against Atlanta on Tuesday night. Koehler is 0-3 with a 3.13 ERA in 10 games, including seven starts, against the Braves.	Braves: RHP Trevor Cahill, acquired from Arizona on April 3, will make his Braves debut. The Braves need Cahill to provide depth and stability to a rotation that has lost Mike Minor indefinitely with a sore shoulder.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Los Angeles Angels starter Matt Shoemaker never had the feeling that the whole game was going to be bad, even after allowing three runs through only six batters.	"It was a terrible inning," Shoemaker said. "Go back in the dugout and maybe reflect on it for 4 seconds and forget it."	That was the only bad inning the right-hander had Monday night in a 6-3 win over the Texas Rangers.	"Just a great game from where it started to where it ended up," manager Mike Scioscia said.	Shoemaker didn't allow another run while pitching into the seventh, and the Angels got a pair of two-run homers from Collin Cowgill and David Freese in the fifth.	Prince Fielder and Mitch Moreland had consecutive RBI singles before a sacrifice fly by Elvis Andrus made it a quick 3-0 Rangers lead.	Shoemaker (2-0) struck out seven with one walk over 6 1/3 innings, winning his ninth consecutive decision over 10 starts. The right-hander is 4-0 in four career starts against Texas, with 21 strikeouts and four walks.	"He started making better pitches, I guess," Fielder said. "That's just part of the game. We couldn't add on."	Huston Street worked the ninth for his AL high-matching third save in three chances.	Both homers off Rangers starter Ross Detwiler (0-2) came with runners on base after walks. Cowgill's first of the season tied the game at 3, and Freese's third made it 5-3.	Los Angeles got its first run in the fourth on a play that ended with Matt Joyce thrown out trying to stretch his RBI double into a triple, though it took a 3-minute, 13-second replay review for that call to stand.	The Angels, swept in three games by Kansas City in their home-opening series over the weekend, have won 10 of their last 11 games in Texas. They had a season-high 12 hits.	Detwiler struck out three and walked four while giving up five runs and eight hits in 5 2/3 innings.	"All day, falling behind. Never getting the hitters defensive," Detwiler said. "I had command early in that first inning and then lost it and never really found it again."	Joyce hit a ball that ricocheted off the glove of right fielder Shin-Soo Choo in the gap. Joyce kept running and dived head-first into third base as Adrian Beltre swiped to tag him. Third base umpire Dan Iassogna called him out in what initially looked clearly to be an out before the Angels challenged the call.	Umpires took a long time looking at replays. Some angles appearing to show Joyce avoiding a tag on his arm, and others seemed to show Beltre's glove making contact.	It was the second time Scioscia questioned Iassogna about a play involving Beltre.	In the Texas first, Beltre was running hard around third on Fielder's hit when he ran into third base coach Tony Beasley, who had signaled for him to stop.	"Evidently there was no holding call on the play," Scioscia said. "He explained contact alone doesn't necessarily dictate. ... I've never coaches' interference, but I thought it was for sure."	EXTRA BASES	With an announced attendance of 18,401, the Rangers had their first home crowd of less than 20,000 since July 2010, before the first of their consecutive World Series appearances. ... Mike Trout, the 23-year-old Angels center fielder who was the unanimous AL MVP last season, played in his 500th career game. ... The Angels have homered in all seven games this season.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: RF Kole Calhoun (right calf soreness) was out of the starting lineup for the second game in a row. Calhoun had a pinch-hit RBI single in the ninth, then was lifted for a pinch-runner. ... RHP Garrett Richards (recovering from left knee surgery) is scheduled to make a rehab start for Triple-A Salt Lake on Tuesday.	Rangers: RHP Tanner Scheppers is close to being activated from the disabled list (right ankle sprain) after three appearances in four games on a rehab assignment with Double-A Frisco, including back-to-back Saturday and Sunday.	UP NEXT	Angels: The Angels go for their 11th win in their last 12 games in Texas when rookie right-hander Drew Rucinski makes his first major league start. He threw two scoreless innings in relief Saturday against Kansas City.	Rangers: Right-hander Nick Martinez (1-0), who had seven scoreless innings in his first start, pitches at home for the first time this season.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CHICAGO --  Jorge Soler came through big and helped the Cubs rally for a win after ace Jon Lester struggled in his second start with Chicago.	Soler had a pair of two-run home runs -- including a game-tying shot in the eighth inning -- and Arismendy Alcantara had an RBI single in the 10th to lift the Cubs to a 7-6 victory over the Cincinnati Reds on Monday night.	Soler, 3-for-5 with three runs scored and four RBIs, was the talk of the locker room after the game.	"His power is just ridiculous," Lester said. "He's so young, he's so raw. He's got a long way to go, and he's pretty good now."	Soler's performance took the focus off of a shaky outing by Lester, who gave up six runs and 10 hits in six innings as his ERA ballooned to 7.84.	"He's still at the end of spring training right now," Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. "He'll be fine. I have no doubt about that."	Lester, who missed time in the spring with an injury, added: "I don't want to use anything as a crutch. I've got a lot of work to do."	Brandon Phillips had four hits for the Reds, while Marlon Byrd and Jay Bruce each drove in two runs. Cincinnati was up 6-3 and starter Mike Leake handed the bullpen a two-run lead after seven innings, but the Reds' relievers failed again.	"I think we're certainly capable of throwing the ball better than we have to this point, by far," manager Bryan Price said. "We should expect more as we move on into the season. I think we have enough talent here to be certainly a lot more consistent than we have been."	Hector Rondon (1-0) gave up two hits in the top of the 10th to pick up the win.	Anthony Rizzo led off the bottom of the 10th inning with a walk against Manny Parra (0-1). Price decided to stay with the left-handed Parra against Soler. After a wild pitch moved Rizzo to second, Soler singled to left on a 3-2 pitch with Rizzo stopping at third. Chris Coghlan (3 for 4, including a solo homer) walked to load the bases with no outs and chase Parra.	Burke Badenhop came on and got Starlin Castro to ground into a force play at the plate, and Alcantara followed a sharp grounder up the middle and past the drawn-in infield.	Alcantara, 0 for 16 until then, got his first hit of the season and his first career walk-off hit.	The win also move the Cubs two games over .500 for the first time since 2009.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: C Devin Mesoraco stayed in Cincinnati to undergo an MRI on his ailing left hip. ... OF Billy Hamilton didn't start because of what the team described as general soreness.	Cubs: 2B Tommy La Stella hasn't played since April 8 because of a strain in his right side. If La Stella doesn't improve soon, a stint on the disabled list is likely. ... 3B Mike Olt (sore right wrist) originally was in the lineup but was scratched about 90 minutes before the game.	BRYANT CALL UP SOON?	With La Stella and Olt hurting, the Cubs may have the cover they need to call up top prospect Kris Bryant later this week when his service time no longer is an issue.	"Maybe," president Theo Epstein said. "We'll see.	"His performance last year and in spring training showed that he was really close and now we're more likely to go get him sooner rather than later. They just started, though. We're trying to get him in a good rhythm down there."	Before Monday, Bryant had homered in his last two games for the Iowa Cubs.	UP NEXT	The series continues Tuesday night with the Cubs' Jake Arrieta (1-0, 0.00) looking for his second win of the season against RHP Anthony DeSclafani (0-0, 3.00). Arrieta is 2-1 in three career starts against Cincinnati, taking a no-hitter into the seventh inning twice.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

HOUSTON --  Entering the season there were questions about the power in an Oakland lineup that had lost Yoenis Cespedes, Brandon Moss and Josh Donaldson in the last year.	On Monday night against Houston, three new members of the Athletics all showed an ability to fill that void.	Billy Butler hit a three-run homer and Marcus Semien and Brett Lawrie connected to back a solid start by Scott Kazmir and give the Athletics an 8-1 win over the Astros.	"It's been great," manager Bob Melvin said of an offense that is tied for second in the majors with 51 runs. "I've said here often you look at our record, you look at what our offense has done, it's probably not indicative of what it should be but we know our pitching is going to come around."	Lawrie, who is in his first season with the A's after four seasons in Toronto, loves his new lineup.	"For the most part it's just confidence knowing that anyone who steps in the box can do some damage," he said.	Kazmir (2-0) allowed three hits and one run while striking out eight in six innings.	The Athletics scored three runs in the first inning before Lawrie's solo shot in second made it 4-0. Semien added a solo homer in the fifth inning before Butler's first home run this season pushed it to 8-1 later in the inning.	Butler has hit safely in each game this season and has the only eight-game hitting streak in the American League.	Jose Altuve had three hits of Houston's five hits, including a home run in the fourth inning.	Houston starter Scott Feldman (0-2) yielded 10 hits and eight runs -- seven earned -- in five innings for the loss.	He was replaced by Asher Wojciechowski, who was scheduled to start Tuesday night, for the sixth inning. Wojciechowski gave up two hits in four scoreless innings.	The A's got things going early when leadoff batter Sam Fuld reached on an error by Jonathan Villar. Mark Canha followed with an RBI double and reached third on another error by Villar. Canha has hit safely in each of the first six games of his career.	A double by Ben Zobrist, who finished with three hits, scored Canha before a one-out RBI single by Ike Davis made it 3-0. Feldman finally escaped the inning when Stephen Vogt grounded into a double play.	Lawrie sent the first pitch of the second inning over the wall in center field to extend the lead to 4-0.	Kazmir was perfect through the first three innings but Altuve homered to start the fourth. Kazmir walked consecutive batters after that, but Chris Carter grounded into a double play before he retired Evan Gattis to limit the damage.	Semien's homer to the Crawford Boxes to start the fifth inning made it 5-1. Butler's home run came with one out in the inning to push Oakland's advantage to 8-1.	The Astros had a chance to cut the lead in the sixth inning when they had runners on first and second with two outs, but Gattis struck out to end the inning. Gattis got his first hit since a homer on Sept. 6 with a single to start Houston's ninth. That hit snapped an 0-for-37 skid with 17 strikeouts, including an 0 for 23 slump with 13 Ks this season.	"It's a step in the right direction -- a small victory," Gattis said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: The A's are close to being done with a cold bug that has been making its way across the team since the start of the season. The illness even hit Melvin who said on Monday that it was the first day he'd felt good in about 10 days. He added that reliever Fernando Abad was still dealing with the issue.	Astros: Houston starter Brett Oberholtzer, who opened the season on the disabled list with a blister on his left index finger, played long toss on Monday without a bandage on his finger for the first time since he was injured.	QUOTABLE	Altuve, who became the first Astro to win a batting title last season by hitting .341, on if he's giving advice to his teammates who are struggling offensively: "I think it's too early to go say something ... you can't let that get in your mind. It's only 20 at-bats. I think we are OK."	UP NEXT	Athletics: Oakland right-hander Kendall Graveman will look to bounce back in his second start after struggling in a loss in his major league debut on Thursday. He allowed seven hits and eight runs in 3 1/3 innings to become the fourth pitcher in Oakland history to allow eight or more runs in his debut with the team.	Astros: Right-hander Brad Peacock (right hip surgery) will be activated from the disabled list to start on Tuesday night. Wojciechowski was optioned to Triple-A Fresno after the game to make room on the roster for Peacock.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

LOS ANGELES --  Alex Guerrero's first career game-ending hit capped a big comeback by the Los Angeles Dodgers.	Guerrero hit a bases-loaded single with two outs in the 10th inning, and the defending NL West champions rallied from four runs down to beat the Seattle Mariners 6-5 on Monday night.	"I've seen Alex for the past year and he's an unbelievable hitter," fellow rookie Joc Pederson said. "When he got up there, I just had a good feeling. He slowed the game down, got a pitch he could hit and hit a rocket. It was huge. We battled as a team and put together enough runs to come out on top."	Nelson Cruz, whose nine interleague home runs last season led the majors, hit the first two of the four homers by the Mariners against Dodgers starter Brandon McCarthy.	However, it wasn't enough as Yasiel Puig helped fuel the Dodgers' comeback with a home run and Howie Kendrick had a tying RBI single later in the fifth inning against James Paxton.	Dominic Leone (0-1), working his third inning of relief, gave up double to Andre Ethier leading off the 10th before retiring Puig on a comebacker. After walks to Adrian Gonzalez and Kendrick loaded the bases, Tyler Olson relieved and struck out Carl Crawford for the second out. Guerrero then lined a 2-2 pitch to right-center to end Seattle's third straight extra-inning game.	Yimi Garcia (1-0) pitched a perfect inning to get his first major league victory.	Dustin Ackley and Kyle Seager also connected off McCarthy, who gave up five runs and six hits in seven innings. He struck out 10 without walking a batter.	The only other time McCarthy gave up four homers in a game was in his second major league start on May 27, 2005, with the Chicago White Sox at the Texas Rangers.	"In that game I threw terribly, so that was more expected than what happened tonight," McCarthy said. "I didn't feel I pitched terrible, but balls just kept leaving the yard. They're an extremely aggressive team, and anything that gets left out there they're going to hit."	According to Baseball-Reference.com, McCarthy was the 11th pitcher since 1914 with to give up as many as four homers and strike out at least 10 batters -- and the first since Milwaukee's Mike Fiers on Sept. 30, 2012, against Houston.	"My job is to always be around the plate as much as I can and attack hitters," McCarthy said. "I know from time to time that sometimes you're going to miss your spot and somebody's going to drive a ball. You just hope it does minimal damage and doesn't come in a grouping like this."	Paxton gave up five runs and six hits over 6 1/3 innings and struck out six. The Dodgers didn't get their first hit until Puig's leadoff single in the fourth started a three-run rally that sliced Seattle's lead to 4-3.	Guerrero hit a bases-loaded sacrifice fly and Pederson followed with a two-run single, after Scott Van Slyke alertly tagged up at first and made it to second on Guerrero's fly with no one covering the bag.	"It cost us a run, but it didn't cost us a ballgame," manager Lloyd McClendon said. "We wasted a lot of good performances tonight."	Ackley got one of the runs back in the fifth with a two-out homer, which turned out to be the Mariners' final hit. The Dodgers tied it with two in the bottom half, including Puig's first-pitch homer.	"I made some mistakes, left some balls up there out over the plate and they capitalized on them," Paxton said.	Cruz staked Paxton to a 2-0 lead before he threw his first pitch. It was the 200th career homer for Cruz, who barely cleared the fence in right-center with one out in the fourth.	The next batter was Seager, whose homer increased Seattle's lead to 4-0. Seventeen of Seattle's first 25 runs this season have come on home runs.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: RHP Tom Wilhelmsen was placed on the 15-disabled list, retroactive to April 11, because of a hyperextended elbow. He was replaced on the roster by Leone, who was recalled from Triple-A Tacoma.	Dodgers: 3B Juan Uribe missed his second straight game because of a sore hamstring and was replaced in the lineup again by Guerrero, who hit his first big league homer on Sunday. ... Justin Turner, who didn't start for the second straight game because of a cut index on his left hand, pinch-hit in the seventh and flied out.	UP NEXT	Mariners: RHP Hisashi Iwakuma (0-1) is 3-0 in three interleague starts (Atlanta, Philadelphia and Washington), allowing three runs in 21 innings with 24 strikeouts.	Dodgers: LHP David Huff, who signed as a free agent in January, will make his season debut for his new club about 39 miles from his hometown of Huntington Beach. It's his first big league start since Sept. 29, 2013, with the Yankees. He is 0-3 with a 10.64 ERA in three career starts against the Mariners.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN DIEGO -- Ender Inciarte made his major league debut with the Arizona Diamondbacks at Petco Park in May and played in nine other games last season at the big downtown home of the San Diego Padres.	On Monday night, it looked like he owned the place.	Inciarte hit two doubles and a triple and drove in a career-high four runs to lead the Diamondbacks to an 8-4 victory against the San Diego Padres.	He also had an outfield assist when he threw out Matt Kemp trying to go from first to third on Justin Upton's single to right in the eighth.	"To be honest I was really pumped up today so at the start of the game I was really happy to be out there and just compete," he said.	"I love San Diego. I know it's hard to hit extra bases here. It's not a hitter's ballpark. I wasn't thinking about that. I was just trying to get a good pitch to hit and put a good swing on it. It worked out for me."	Inciarte hit a two-run double in the second, when the Diamondbacks scored four unearned runs on five hits off Andrew Cashner and an error, and a two-run triple in the three-run eighth to help break it open. He also doubled and scored in the seventh.	"He's forcing his way in there," manager Chip Hale said. "It's exciting baseball. He's been a sparkplug for us defensively. Throwing out Kemp at third base was a big play. We were still up four runs but it probably saved us a run there. He just continues to play good baseball."	Rubby De La Rosa (2-0) held San Diego to three runs and six hits in six innings for his second straight win. He struck out five and walked one.	The Padres were coming off three straight wins against the defending World Series champion San Francisco Giants.	Cashner (0-2) allowed consecutive singles to Mark Trumbo and Jake Lamb opening the second before striking out Aaron Hill. Second baseman Yangervis Solarte fielded Tuffy Gosewisch's groundball but threw wide of first baseman Yonder Alonso for an error, allowing Trumbo to score. De La Rosa struck out before Inciarte hit a two-run double to left and Chris Owings hit an RBI single to right.	"I thought I had some of the best stuff I've had in a long time, a good slider, a good changeup, good fastball command," Cashner said. "But in the second, I kind of lost my fastball command a little bit. I thought my biggest mistake was to Inciarte."	Said manager Bud Black: "Obviously, the error hurt us and the hit by Inciarte was a big one for them. ... He fell behind Inciarte in the second. He'd probably like to have the pitch back to Owings that tacked on the fourth run. But overall, he was fine as far as his stuff."	Alonso homered in the second, and Solarte helped pull the Padres within a run by hitting an RBI double in the third and an RBI single in the fifth.	Arizona's Paul Goldschmidt had an RBI groundout in the seventh and the Diamondbacks added three more runs in the eighth.	Cashner struck out nine and walked one in six innings. He allowed seven hits and four runs, all unearned.	TRAINERS ROOM	Diamondbacks: Manager Chip Hale said he'll carry two catchers through at least the Padres series and their right-handed heavy staff. C Oscar Hernandez (hand) remains on the DL.	Padres: Manager Bud Black said RHP Ian Kennedy, on the DL with a strained left hamstring, is making progress. Black said Kennedy could soon throw a bullpen session.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: RHP Jeremy Hellickson (0-1, 6.23) is scheduled to make his second start. He made his Diamondbacks debut in a 5-2 loss to San Francisco on Wednesday.	Padres: RHP Odrisamer Despaigne (0-0, 0.00) makes his first start of the season; he moved into the rotation after Ian Kennedy left Thursday's home opener with a strained left hamstring. Odrisamer relieved Kennedy and pitched 4 2/3 perfect innings of relief.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

BOSTON --  The Red Sox hit the ball well for the second straight game. They won because the Washington Nationals kept having trouble fielding it.	Two errors by pitcher Blake Treinen helped Boston erase a seventh-inning deficit, and the Red Sox beat Washington 8-7 Tuesday night as the Nationals struggled defensively for the second day in a row.	"It's not going to happen every day," Boston's Hanley Ramirez said, "but you've got to take advantage when that happens, so that's what we did."	The Red Sox had 14 hits in Monday's 9-4 win in which Washington center fielder Michael A. Taylor let two balls drop for singles in a four-run third inning when Boston took an 8-0 lead .On Tuesday, the Red Sox finished with 11 hits, including a solo homer by Dustin Pedroia.	"It's the same recipe," Washington manager Matt Williams said. "If you put all the ingredients together the same way every time, then you're going to get the same meal."	The Red Sox had no hits in the seventh but scored three unearned runs, with the help of three errors, to take an 8-7 lead.	Ramirez reached first base on a fielding error by shortstop Ian Desmond before Shane Victorino was hit by a pitch from Matt Thornton. After Mike Napoli's flyout sent Ramirez to third, Treinen replaced Thornton and hit Allen Craig, loading the bases.	Treinen (0-1) fielded Ryan Hanigan's bouncer in front of the plate, dropped the ball as Ramirez scored, then threw it past catcher Wilson Ramos as Victorino came home with the tying run. Craig scored the go-ahead run on Brock Holt's groundout.	"I just felt like I got to it perfectly fine. I was telling myself just to be smooth and get it to the plate," Treinen said. "Then the transition in between my glove and my hand, I just bobbled it, it fell to the ground. I just kind of had to get rid of it quick and made a terrible throw."	Boston third baseman Pablo Sandoval left the game in the top of the sixth with a bruised left foot after being hit by a pitch in the bottom of the third. Manager John Farrell said the foot became sore as the game progressed but an examination showed no fracture.	Edward Mujica (1-0) got the win and Koji Uehara got his first save by finishing a perfect ninth -- after Ryan Zimmerman's shot went just to the left of the left-field foul pole -- one day after being activated from the disabled list.	"Much like we've seen a lot from Koji," Farrell said. "Three up and three down."	Nationals starter Stephen Strasburg allowed five runs and 10 hits in 5 1/3 innings, leaving him with a 6.75 ERA.	Washington reached Justin Masterson for six runs in the fifth as they sent 10 batters to the plate.	Masterson retired leadoff hitter Yunel Escobar then loaded the bases when he hit Jayson Werth with a pitch, gave up a single to Harper and walked Zimmerman. Clint Robinson then singled in a run and another scored when Ramos grounded out. Desmond doubled in two runs before a triple by Taylor drove in two more, putting Washington ahead 7-5.	RUDE RETURN	Masterson pitched in Fenway Park for the team he started his career with for the first time since being traded to Cleveland in July 2009 for Victor Martinez. "It was great," he said. "I was hoping it would be a little bit better, but it was just good. The fans here are just incredible."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: LF Jayson Werth played his second straight game after being activated from the DL following right shoulder surgery in January. He batted second, went 0 for 4 and is 0 for 7 this year.	Red Sox: SS Xander Bogaerts missed the game with a sore right knee. Farrell said he might be able to play in Wednesday's series finale. RHP Brandon Workman visited orthopedist Dr. James Andrews to check on his right elbow. Workman has been with Triple-A Pawtucket this season after going 1-10 with a 5.17 ERA last season in 19 games for Boston.	UP NEXT	Gio Gonzalez (0-1) faces Wade Miley (0-0) in the finale of the three-game series. They last faced each other on Aug. 21 when Miley was with Arizona. Neither allowed a run -- Gonzalez in seven innings, Miley in 6 2/3 -- before Washington won in the bottom of the ninth when an error allowed the game's only run to score. It was Washington's 10th consecutive win.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

BALTIMORE --  Miguel Gonzalez had already done enough to earn a handshake from manager Buck Showalter and a seat in the dugout for a job well done.	Except, after throwing 94 pitches over six innings, the right-hander wasn't quite finished.	"He wouldn't let me go get him," Showalter said.	Gonzalez justified the decision by striking out the side in the seventh, and the Baltimore Orioles held on to beat the New York Yankees 4-3 Tuesday night.	Gonzalez (1-1) finished with a career-high 10 strikeouts. He gave up four hits, a walk and one run.	"Against the Yankees, you can't give in," he said. "Every pitch has to be a quality pitch. Make sure you do your job and keep your team in the ballgame."	Gonzalez wasn't going to leave after six innings unless Showalter tied him to the bench.	"That's what we want as starting pitchers; we want to go deep in ballgames," Gonzalez said. "I was happy he gave me the chance to go out there again."	Adam Jones homered and drove in two runs for the Orioles, and Caleb Joseph contributed two hits and an RBI.	Kevin Gausman gave up two runs in the eighth, and Zach Britton got four outs for his second save.	Yankees starter CC Sabathia (0-2) yielded four runs and seven hits in seven innings, walking one and striking out seven. Although he is 18-7 against the Orioles, the left-hander is 0-5 with a 5.48 ERA in his last seven starts in Baltimore.	In his first outing of the season, Sabathia gave up four earned runs in 5 2/3 innings against Toronto.	"I thought he was good again," manager Joe Girardi said. "He gave up a few hard hit balls. I like the way he is throwing."	Sabathia was seeking his first win since April 24, 2014, after missing most of last season with a knee injury.	"I'm feeling pretty good," Sabathia said. "I'm commanding the ball pretty good. I just need to tighten up a few things."	Alex Rodriguez was not in the Yankees' the starting lineup for the first time this season. The 39-year-old is seeking a return to form after being suspended last season for drug use.	He entered as a pinch hitter with two outs and none on in the ninth. Rodriguez received jeers from many in the crowd of 19,283 before bouncing out to shortstop.	Jones put the Orioles up 1-0 in the first inning with his fourth home run in five games. He added a sacrifice fly in the third after Sabathia issued a leadoff walk.	Baltimore made it 3-0 in the fourth when Delmon Young singled, moved up on a wild pitch and scored on a two-out single by Joseph.	Gonzalez retired 10 straight batters before Jacoby Ellsbury led off the sixth with a single. With two outs, Mark Teixeira hit an RBI double.	Joseph led off the seventh with his first career triple and Everth Cabrera brought him home with a fly ball.	"That last inning, giving up that triple, really made the difference in the game," Sabathia said. "I just need to make a better pitch there."	New York closed to 4-3 in the eighth. Chase Headley singled in a run and scored when Alejandro De Aza dropped a fly to left.	FAULTY FIELDING	Yankees: New York made two errors, giving the Yankees 11 in eight games.	Orioles: Showalter thought the error De Aza received after chasing the ball near the warning track should have been called a hit. It was only Baltimore's third error this season.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: OF Brett Gardner took the night off after being struck in the right wrist Tuesday by a pitch from Wei-Yin Chen.	Orioles: C Matt Wieters (elbow surgery) took five at-bats as a DH in extended spring training and threw from 150 feet. Showalter says Wieters could soon begin a rehabilitation assignment.	ON DECK	Yankees: RHP Nathan Eovaldi makes his second start since coming to the Yankees from the Marlins in an offseason trade.	Orioles: RHP Bud Norris, who got hit hard in Baltimore's home opener against Toronto, seeks to put a major dent in his 24.00 ERA.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PITTSBURGH --  A.J. Burnett's "homecoming" was everything he could have hoped for. Except for taking a tough-luck loss.	The veteran right-hander allowed only one run in 6 2/3 innings but Shane Greene pitched eight strong innings and the Detroit Tigers bounced back from their first loss of the season with a 2-0 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Tuesday night.	Burnett (0-1) scattered seven hits, struck out eight and walked two.	"A very efficient, a very strong outing by A.J.," Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle.	A fan favorite in Pittsburgh before leaving as a free agent after the 2013 season and signing with the Philadelphia Phillies, Burnett received a warm ovation from the PNC Park crowd.	"The whole night was humbling," Burnett said. "From people saying `hi' and welcoming me back when I walked through the tunnel to the clubhouse when I got to the ballpark to all the support I got from the fans during the game. I definitely felt like I was back home again."	The two walks cost Burnett, though, as he issued them back-to-back to Alex Avila and Jose Iglesias with one out in the seventh inning and the game scoreless.	Greene, who hadn't stepped in a batter's box since he was 14, struck out while unsuccessfully trying to bunt the runners up but Rajai Davis then grounded a single up the middle to score Avila.	Greene (2-0) allowed just three singles and two of them never left the infield. He had three strikeouts and no walks after the Tigers' six-game winning streak ended on Monday with a 5-4 loss.	"Throw strikes and pound the zone" the 26-year-old right-hander said in explaining his success.	The Pirates had scored 15 runs in winning their previous two games but were shut down by Greene.	"It was three punchouts and a lot of contact but not a lot of hard contact," Hurdle said. "We weren't able to connect the dots."	Greene has allowed only one unearned run in 16 innings through his first two starts of the season. Acquired from the New York Yankees in an offseason trade that also included the Arizona Diamondbacks, Greene also pitched eight innings last Thursday to beat the Minnesota Twins.	"Guys have made me feel welcome here from the beginning but it's been a little extra special to win a couple of games," Greene said. "I feel like I'm even more part of the team now. You want the guys to know you can contribute."	Joakim Soria retired the side in order in the ninth inning for his third save in place of closer Joe Nathan, who is on the disabled list.	Davis and Jose Iglesias each had two hits for Detroit while Ian Kinsler added an RBI single in the ninth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: RHP Justin Verlander, on the disabled list with a right triceps strain, will pitch a simulated game Wednesday of at least four innings and 60 pitches. Ausmus is hoping the 2011 American League MVP and Cy Young Award winner might possibly throw as many as 75 pitches.	UP NEXT	Pirates left-hander Francisco Liriano (0-0) faces Alfredo Simon (1-0) on Wednesday night in the finale of the three-game series.	Liriano, who is 5-8 lifetime against the Tigers, has not pitched since the April 6 opener at Cincinnati while spending time on the paternity list.	Acquired from the Cincinnati Reds in a December trade, Simon won his Tigers' debut last Friday at Cleveland. He has a 3-4 career record against the Pirates.	OUTTA HERE	Hurdle was ejected in the top of the eighth inning by home plate David Rackley for arguing balls and strikes. Pittsburgh is the only team in the major leagues without a bench coach, so quality control coach Dave Jauss managed the team.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

TORONTO --  Steven Souza got the Tampa Bay Rays started with a long home run, and then sparked the go-ahead rally with a bunt.	Desmond Jennings drove in Souza with a tiebreaking sacrifice fly in the eighth inning, and the Rays beat the Toronto Blue Jays 3-2 Tuesday night for their fourth straight win.	Souza opened the scoring in the first with a drive off the facing of the third deck in center.	"I've seen a lot of baseball games here, and that has got to be the furthest ball I've ever seen hit," said Rays manager Kevin Cash, whose playing career started with the Blue Jays.	The drive was measured at 463 feet. It was the longest home run for the Rays since Carlos Pena's 466-foot shot against Washington on June 13, 2009.	"It's fun when it goes like that," Souza said. "Have you ever cut butter with a knife? That's what it feels like."	The drive came on the first pitch Souza saw from rookie left-hander Daniel Norris.	"He hit it about 700 feet," Norris said with some exaggeration.	Souza needed less than 60 feet to make an impact with his next hit. With the score 2-all, Souza reached on a bunt single off Miguel Castro (0-1) leading off the eighth.	One out later, Souza stole second and advanced to third on catcher Russell Martin's throwing error. Evan Longoria was intentionally walked before Jennings drove an 0-2 pitch to center, scoring Souza.	"Desmond's at-bat, to me, was as crucial as they come," Cash said. "When you fall behind on that type of stuff, it's really tough to elevate a pitch."	Steve Geltz (1-0) pitched 1 1/3 innings for his first major league win. Grant Balfour and Kevin Jepsen each pitched an inning of hitless relief, with Jepsen getting his first save this year.	Kevin Kiermaier made a spectacular grab to retire Devon Travis for the second out of the ninth, leaping against the scoreboard in right-center.	"I feel like if it's in the air, I'm going to catch it," Kiermaier said. "The only way I'm not going to catch it is if it goes out."	Tim Beckham made it 2-0 with a sacrifice fly in the second, and Toronto chased rookie Matt Andriese with a two-run fourth. Kevin Pillar hit an RBI single and Andriese left after the Rays couldn't turn the double play on Travis' grounder, with Pillar sliding into Beckham at second base. Kirby Yates came on and gave up an RBI double to Jose Reyes.	Martin went 0 for 4 with two strikeouts and is hitless in 21 at-bats. Martin came up with men at first and second in his first two at-bats but fanned each time.	"I'm not going to be down on myself," said Martin, who signed a five-year, $82 million contract in November. "I'm trying my best and I'm going to keep trying my best."	Making his first career start, Andriese allowed two runs and five hits in 3 2/3 innings. Norris gave up two runs and two hits in five innings.	BULLPEN SHUFFLE	With RHP Erasmo Ramirez, a reliever, scheduled to start Wednesday, the Rays optioned Yates to Triple-A Durham following the game. They will make a corresponding move before Wednesday's game to add another reliever.	RISP VS. REWARD	The Rays are 0 for 13 with runners in scoring position through the first two games of this series but have won twice.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: LHP Drew Smyly (left shoulder) pitched three shutout innings in his second rehab start at Class A Charlotte. Smyly allowed one hit, struck out four and walked none. He is to start against Sunday at Double-A Montgomery.	Blue Jays: OF Michael Saunders (left knee) sat for the second straight day. He left Sunday's game for Class A Dunedin after one inning with a sore right hamstring. Saunders is expected to return to Dunedin's lineup Wednesday.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays LHP Mark Buehrle (1-0) went 2-0 with a 2.66 ERA in six starts against the Rays in 2014. Buehrle got his 200th win last Friday against Baltimore. Tampa Bay's starting rotation has combined for 102 career wins. Ramirez will come out of the bullpen to start for Tampa Bay.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CLEVELAND --  A split-second after throwing a pitch, Carlos Carrasco was face down in the dirt, motionless on the edge of the mound.	As Indians manager Terry Francona left the dugout to check his injured starter, he braced himself for the worst. At that moment, nothing mattered but his player's well-being.	"That's not a good feeling," Francona said. "When he's just laying there, man, that's scary."	Carrasco was struck in the face by a line drive in the first inning but only sustained a bruised jaw, and Chicago's Jose Quintana pitched six strong innings, leading the White Sox to a 4-1 win on Tuesday night.	Cleveland's No. 2 starter, Carrasco was knocked off his feet when Melky Cabrera -- the second hitter -- rocketed a shot up the middle that slammed the right side of the right-hander's face. Carrasco (1-1) luckily got a piece of his glove on the ball before it smashed him.	X-rays taken at Lutheran Hospital were negative, and Carrasco returned to Progressive Field during the game. Francona said Carrasco has a bruise, "a pretty good one," but was feeling well enough to do arm exercises.	"In the big picture, we dodged a really big bullet," Francona said. "Very fortunate."	The White Sox scored two runs in the first after Carrasco was injured and won their third straight. Chicago is 10-24 against Cleveland since 2013.	Quintana (1-0) allowed three hits, struck out six and improved to 4-0 in 10 starts against the Indians, whose left-handed heavy lineup is struggling against left-handers.	David Robertson struck out the side in the ninth for his second save.	Jose Abreu hit his second homer in the fifth for a 4-1 lead, giving Quintana more cushion than he would need.	Cleveland managed just three hits and dropped its fourth straight.	Carrasco, making his second start, was flattened by Cabrera's shot and stayed down on the ground in front of the mound with his legs spread wide as Francona and a trainer raced out to him.	With his concerned teammates looking on, Carrasco stayed down for several minutes. Cabrera, holding his batting helmet, came out to the side of the mound to check on Carrasco as well, and White Sox center fielder Adam Eaton dropped to one knee at second base in prayer.	"It was a very tough moment," said Cabrera, who was relieved to learn Carrasco was not hurt seriously. "It was real scary because it hit his face, but it's baseball. You can't control it once you hit the ball. I felt bad."	Francona said Carrasco was initially not very responsive when he was being checked on, but began to come around.	"There's a big relief, he knew where he was," Francona said. "Things that are more important than, `Can he pitch in five days.' He's OK."	Zach McAllister replaced Carrasco, who signed a four-year, $22 million contract last week.	Carrasco's injury is another early season blow to the Indians. On Sunday, catcher Yan Gomes was placed on the disabled list with a sprained knee and could miss two months. Also, All-Star left fielder Michael Brantley missed his fifth straight game with a bad back.	MOSS A MESS	Indians RF Brandon Moss, acquired during the off-season to give Cleveland needed power, struck out four times and is batting just .100 (2 for 20) with just one RBI. Francona remains confident Moss will come around.	"You're going to have those days with Mossy," he said. "I'm as confident when it's all said and done putting up some pretty big numbers. That's part of the package, but when he gets hot you'll see the other part."	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox: RHP Jake Petricka (sore forearm) threw a simulated game in Arizona on Monday. Manager Robin Ventura doesn't have an exact timetable for Petricka's return, but the reliever could rejoin the team this weekend.	Indians: Brantley took part in pregame batting practice and Francona said the team's best position player is "trending in the right direction." Brantley will likely sit out Wednesday's game as the Indians are off Thursday and want to give him as much rest as possible. Brantley has been bothered by a stiff back since reporting to training camp in Arizona.	UP NEXT	White Sox: LHP John Danks, who lost his season debut first start against Kansas City, has struggled against the Indians. Danks is just 5-11 with a 5.10 ERA in 22 career starts against Cleveland. Ryan Raburn is batting .333 (14 for 42) with three homers and 11 RBIs against Danks.	Indians: RHP Trevor Bauer tries to build off a dazzling season debut at Houston, when he struck out 11 and did not allow a hit in six innings. Bauer is looking to win consecutive starts for the first time in his career.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ATLANTA --  Perhaps Dee Gordon was the culprit, but nobody in the Marlins' clubhouse would say for sure who spread bats around the floor before the game.	Whatever the intention, Giancarlo Stanton liked what he saw from Miami's offense.	"At least we can keep it loose here," he said. "We're not coming in here like our dog died."	Stanton broke out of a slump with three hits and four RBIs, Gordon and Ichiro Suzuki each scored two runs and the Marlins beat the Atlanta Braves 8-2 Tuesday night.	Stanton, who signed a record 13-year, $325 million contract in November, began the game hitting just .130 with three RBIs in 23 at-bats. But he was dialed in against the Braves (6-2).	It marked the fourth time that he's reached five times safely in the same game and marked the first time since last April that he didn't record an out in at least five plate appearances.	Also, in his last at-bat, for the first time this season, he didn't wear the face guard on his helmet. He has used it since spring training to protect his face, which was fractured when he was hit by a pitch in September, ending his season. He was facing a left-hander, Andrew McKirahan, and slapped a two-run double into left field to make the score 8-2.	"We got a win, so that's the biggest part," Stanton said after ending a 0-for-12 slump. "Contributing to that is good for us and we need a series tomorrow."	Tom Koehler (1-1) gave up six hits, two runs and two walks with three strikeouts in 5 1/3 innings for the win.	The Marlins went up 3-0 in the first on Stanton's RBI single, Martin Prado's sacrifice fly and Michael Morse's RBI double. Stanton also walked twice and scored two runs in the game.	It was just the fourth multi-run inning for Miami (2-6) in eight games this year.	A few of the Marlins said that Gordon might have been behind the pre-game bat display, but the leadoff hitter wouldn't say.	"Whoever did that was pretty smart," Gordon said, adding that it was impressive to see the team produce 11 hits. "It was awesome, man. Guys came out swinging."	Trevor Cahill (0-1), making his first start for Atlanta and 171st of his career, allowed five hits, four runs and three walks with two strikeouts in 2 1/3 innings in the loss.	Cahill began the night having allowed three hits, one RBI and three walks with three strikeouts in the 10 times he'd faced Stanton.	"It seems like over the years that he's changed his approach against me," Cahill said. "I feel like early on he would chase, and he was real patient today. I was trying to get ahead in the first inning and I left it middle-up. I think I was fortunate he didn't hit it farther."	Cahill's struggles continued in the third. He hit Morse with a pitch to load the bases and was chased after Marcell Ozuna walked to make it 4-0.	Sugar Ray Marimon, the fourth Atlanta reliever to make his majors debut this year, bailed out Cahill, but the Braves were trailing 5-0 in the fourth after Stanton's RBI single.	In the bottom of the inning, Freddie Freeman and A.J. Pierzynski hit back-to-back home runs to cut the lead to 5-2.	The Marlins made it 6-2 in the sixth on Gordon's sacrifice fly. Gordon has reached safely in seven of eight games and is hitting .364. He had two hits and two stolen bases.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: LF Christian Yelich was scratched from the lineup because of tightness in his back. Suzuki took his place, going 1 for 4 with a walk and scored two runs. Yelich, a Gold Glove winner last year, has been getting treatment recently for his back and is listed as day to day.	Braves: Manager Fredi Gonzalez had no update on starting LHP Mike Minor, who's on the 15-day disabled list with shoulder inflammation and has yet to throw again off a mound since aggravating the injury.	UP NEXT	Marlins: RHP Dan Haren (0-0) makes his second start of the season after allowing four hits, one run and striking out two Friday against Tampa Bay. Haren is 6-2 with a 4.50 ERA in nine starts and a relief appearance against Atlanta.	Braves: LHP Eric Stults (0-0) has a 5.29 ERA and is 2/3 in seven games, including six starts, against Miami.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

NEW YORK -- The crowd was buzzing before Matt Harvey even threw a pitch. By the time he struck out his first two batters, fans were chanting his name.	But at the conclusion of a wild night inside Citi Field, the Mets were worried about David Wright's hamstring injury -- and Harvey was just happy he hung on to win.	Harvey labored through six innings during his first home start in almost 20 months, and Lucas Duda hit a three-run double to lead New York past the Philadelphia Phillies 6-5 on Tuesday for its third straight victory.	"I think obviously I came out pretty strong, and I think as the game went on, pitches were kind of creeping over the middle," Harvey said. "That might have been the weirdest game I've been a part of, maybe ever."	Daniel Murphy homered over the right-center fence that was brought in 3 to 11 feet this season at Citi Field, and the Mets beat their NL East rivals for the 19th time in the last 25 meetings. But it wasn't all good news for New York: Wright and Michael Cuddyer left the game with injuries.	"This is as eventful a game as I've ever seen. It had a little bit of everything," Cuddyer said.	Cuddyer, who had an RBI single, exited early with a bruised hand and X-rays were negative. He hopes to play Wednesday night.	Wright pulled his right hamstring while stealing second in the eighth and acknowledged it's possible he's headed to the disabled list. He'll have an MRI on Wednesday, but the Mets' captain said this injury isn't nearly as bad as the strained right hamstring that sidelined him for seven weeks late in the 2013 season.	"Real frustrating," Wright said. "Hopefully for me the worst-case scenario is two weeks."	Chase Utley homered twice for Philadelphia and hit an RBI single after entering 2 for 22 (.091). He also was hit in the back by a 95 mph fastball from Harvey with first base open -- prompting plate umpire Alfonso Marquez to warn both benches.	Harvey (2-0) was no doubt retaliating after Phillies starter David Buchanan (0-2) plunked Wilmer Flores and Cuddyer in the second, both on the left hand.	"It was intense and that's what we kind of expect with these games in our division," Philadelphia's Cody Asche said. "Tensions are going to rise every now and then."	With the Mets out of bench players, backup catcher Anthony Recker played third base in the ninth for the first time in his professional career. Wearing a glove given to him years ago by a minor league teammate, the ball never came his way.	New York manager Terry Collins was gone by the fifth, ejected by Marquez for arguing a catcher's interference call.	"This was a bizarre night," said Collins, who also requested a replay challenge too late -- which nevertheless led to a delay that lasted more than four minutes as umpires tried to determine whether he came out of the dugout in time.	Harvey struck out nine in six shutout innings last week at Washington, his first outing since Tommy John surgery in October 2013.	Finally back on the Citi Field mound where he started the All-Star Game that year, the right-hander whiffed eight and walked none. He gave up three runs and five hits.	"You have to get used to being out there more and more, and having a lot of adrenaline running, I kind of got fastball-happy," Harvey said. "But those are parts of playing through a season and coming back from an injury where you're gone for so long. ... It's not like I'm not going to ever give up a run."	Jeurys Familia allowed Jeff Francoeur's solo homer in the ninth before earning his third save.	Travis d'Arnaud had an RBI single for the Mets in the fifth after Duda's second double. Phillies manager Ryne Sandberg lost a replay challenge on the play at the plate.	Harvey gave up solo homers to Utley and Asche -- and even a leadoff double to Buchanan. That came in the fifth, when Harvey escaped a bases-loaded jam by retiring Carlos Ruiz on a popup.	CROWD CONTROL	GM Sandy Alderson all but acknowledged the Mets avoided throwing Harvey on Monday in the hopes of drawing more fans for their second home date, which often attracts a thin crowd. Attendance was 39,489, a jump from 29,146 last year for the second home game against Washington.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: Right-handed relievers Vic Black (shoulder tendinitis) and Bobby Parnell (elbow surgery) began their rehab assignments with Class A St. Lucie, each throwing one inning. They'll both need to pitch on back-to-back days -- maybe twice -- before coming off the disabled list, Collins said. ... LHP Jerry Blevins was unavailable out of the bullpen after pitching the previous two days.	PAUL BLART: BALLPLAYER	Actor and comedian Kevin James, a Mets fan from Long Island, took batting practice on the field. He wore a No. 24 Mets jersey with his son's name, Kannon, on the back.	UP NEXT	Phillies: RHP Jerome Williams starts the series finale Wednesday night. He beat the Mets 7-2 at Citi Field last August.	Mets: LHP Jonathon Niese is 8-6 with a 3.00 ERA in 19 starts vs. Philadelphia, his most wins against any team.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Robinson Chirinos drove in a career-high five RBIs but was easily more pleased that he was a big part of helping Texas starter Nick Martinez to the win.	"If you have a win, no matter how you do, that's a victory for everybody," Chirinos said.	The Rangers' No. 9 hitter hit a three-run home run and two-run double in their 8-2 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Tuesday night.	The double in the second fell between centerfielder Mike Trout and leftfielder Matt Joyce, who was acquired last winter from Tampa Bay, as they crossed paths just short of the warning track.	"Mike plays so deep in the outfield -- every time you hit a ball, you're kind of praying it goes over the fence because he catches everything," Chirinos said.	Trout said he feared a collision and veered off late. He said his communication with Joyce, who was hurt much of spring training, will improve.	"We'll get it straightened out," Trout said.	Elvis Andrus homered off Jose Alvarez in the sixth and Chirinos hit the three-run drive for an 8-0 lead. Andrus had not homered in 481 at-bats since connecting last May 21 against Seattle's Chris Young, the longest active homerless streak in the majors.	Martinez (2-0) allowed one run -- unearned -- and five hits in seven innings, improving to 2-7 in home games in his season-plus big league career. He has a career 1.50 ERA in April over 30 innings.	Martinez, 5-12 last season as a surprise addition to the opening day roster, said he worked during the offseason on hitting his spots better and controlling his emotions on the mound.	"Hitters are like sharks, man," he said. "They feed off energy if you're showing that you're being affected by the game in a negative way."	Both of Martinez's victories have followed Texas defeats.	"For him to be that guy twice now, it does show poise," first-year Rangers manager Jeff Banister said. `I can't say enough how in control of himself he is."	Drew Rucinski (0-1), who made his big league debut last year, gave up four runs, six hits and four walks in 2 2/3 innings in his first major league start for the Angels. The 26-year-old right-hander labored through a 40-pitch second inning that also included two wild pitches and two of the Rangers' three stolen bases in the first two innings.	"Drew just never got on track," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "I don't think he brought his best game out there on the mound, and he's a better pitcher than that."	EXTRA BASES	Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel, the 2012 Heisman Trophy winner from Texas A&M attended the game. He recently completed time in a drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility. . After the game, the Angels optioned Rucinski to Triple-A Salt Lake, and the Rangers sent right-hander Phil Klein to Triple-A Round Rock.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: RF Kole Calhoun (calf) was available to pinch hit but missed his third consecutive start. RHP Garrett Richards (knee) made a rehab start Tuesday night for Triple-A Salt Lake and, according to Los Angeles manager Mike Scioscia, might start for the Angels on Sunday.	Rangers: RHP Kyuji Fujikawa (groin) allowed one earned run while pitching one inning Tuesday in a rehab appearance for Double-A Frisco.	UP NEXT	Angels: Albert Pujols figures to be a DH for Wednesday afternoon's series finale after seeing action at first base in each of Los Angeles' first eight games. LHP Hector Santiago (0-1) is 3-0 in career starts in Arlington.	Rangers: RHP Anthony Ranaudo will be recalled from Triple-A Round Rock to make his Rangers debut. Acquired from Boston last winter, Ranaudo replaces injured LHP Derek Holland.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

CHICAGO --  The Cincinnati Reds needed something to go right. On Tuesday, starter Anthony DeSclafani made sure enough went their way to end a three-game losing streak.	DeSclafani threw seven scoreless innings, Joey Votto had two hits and drove in a run, and the Reds held on to beat the Chicago Cubs 3-2 on Tuesday night.	DeSclafani gave up two hits while striking out five for the Reds. Acquired this offseason as part of the trade that sent former ace Mat Latos to the Miami Marlins, DeSclafani (1-0) earned his first victory for Cincinnati and impressed manager Bryan Price.	"Very much so, because here's a rookie coming in with this team on a three-game skid where let some leads get away," Price said.	DeSclafani was replaced in the eighth by former Cubs closer Kevin Gregg, who walked Matt Szczur before allowing pinch-hitter Welington Castillo's two-run home run. Gregg was replaced by Tony Cingrani, who allowed a two-out single to Anthony Rizzo and a walk to Jorge Soler before striking out Chris Coghlan to end the threat.	"If we keep giving that kind of effort, I'll be very happy," Cubs manager Joe Maddon said.	In the ninth, Aroldis Chapman gave up a Starlin Castro leadoff single and a one-out walk to Szczur but struck out David Ross and Mike Olt to convert his third save in three tries.	DeSclafani and the Reds got the win thanks in part to an offense that scored three runs in the fourth against Jake Arrieta (1-1), who dominated Cincinnati last season. Arrieta took no-hitters into the seventh inning twice against the Reds in 2014 but didn't match that Tuesday. He went 6 2/3 innings and allowed three runs and seven hits while striking out five and allowed an earned run for the first time since Sept. 9.	That wasn't enough to help the Cubs win their fourth straight one night after moving two games above .500 for the first time since the end of the 2009 season.	"We were right there," Arrieta said.	Billy Hamilton, back in the lineup after missing Monday's game due to general soreness, led off the Reds' three-run fourth with a single, stole second and scored on Votto's single. Cincinnati doubled its lead on a bizarre play that started with Jay Bruce singling to left to drive in Todd Frazier, but saw Castro race to try to cover third and fall on Brandon Phillips before getting up and picking off Bruce who had strayed too far off first.	The Reds capped the fourth-inning scoring when Marlon Byrd drove in Phillips, giving DeSclafani enough support for the win.	"It's good to get a win under our belt," DeSclafani said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: C Devin Mesoraco was out because of his ailing left hip, and Price said there isn't any consideration to put him on the disabled list "at this point." ... Price said RHP Homer Bailey (right forearm) will throw a bullpen session Wednesday and is scheduled to make his season debut Saturday against the St. Louis Cardinals. ... Phillips was replaced in the fifth by Skip Schumaker due to "lightheadedness" and Price said his second baseman passed a concussion test.	Cubs: INF Tommy La Stella (right rib cage inflammation) was placed on the 15-day disabled list retroactive to April 9, and Chicago recalled LHP Zac Rosscup from Triple-A Iowa.	UP NEXT	The series finale on Wednesday night pits the Reds' Jason Marquis (0-0, 4.50) against the Cubs' Travis Wood (0-1,5.79). Both starters will be facing their former teams. Marquis went 23-18 in 65 starts with Chicago in the 2007 and 2008 seasons, while Wood was 11-10 in 35 starts with Cincinnati during the 2010 and 2011 seasons.	FLASHING LEATHER	DeSclafani made a strong play for the first out in the fifth on a sharp Castro grounder up the middle. DeSclafani attempted to reach behind his back to grab the grounder but lost his glove in the process. The Reds pitcher still had time to run a few feet off the mound to grab the ball and throw out Castro.	KRIS' TIME?	The Cubs have 13 pitchers, though Maddon and president Theo Epstein didn't discount the possibility of adding an infielder for Friday's game against the San Diego Padres. Could that infielder be hyped prospect Kris Bryant? "It depends on what's happening with the roster, what's happening with his development," Epstein said. "We don't know yet."

Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

HOUSTON --  Oakland rookie Kendall Graveman was walking off the mound after pitching into the sixth inning of what would be his first major league win against the Astros on Tuesday night when he heard a familiar voice.	Graveman didn't think any of his family was in Houston to see him pitch. He was thrilled when he realized it was his uncle John Andrews who had traveled from Alabama to be at the game.	"I don't how he got here," Graveman said. "Did he drive? Did he fly?"	Either way, the 24-year-old pitcher was excited.	"It's always good to have family around," he said. "So yeah, it surprised me."	Four relievers completed the shutout to help the Athletics to the 4-0 victory.	Graveman (1-1) yielded four hits in 5 1/3 innings to bounce back from his first major league start, when he allowed eight runs in 3 1/3 innings. Eric O'Flaherty allowed one hit in 1 2/3 innings, Dan Otero gave up two in 2/3 innings, and Fernando Abad retired one batter before Tyler Clippard finished it off in the ninth.	The Athletics were up by 1 in the sixth inning before an RBI double by Billy Butler that gave him the American League's only nine-game hitting streak. Stephen Vogt added a run with an RBI single later in the inning to make it 3-0.	Houston starter Brad Peacock (0-1) allowed five hits and three runs in five-plus innings after being activated from the disabled list on Tuesday. He made one rehabilitation start at Triple-A Fresno as he recovered from offseason hip surgery.	Houston outhit Oakland 8-7, but the Astros couldn't push across any runs as they went 0 for 7 with runners in scoring position.	"We just weren't able to get that hit that catapulted us," Houston manager A.J. Hinch said. "Some good at-bats, some bad at-bats, and then ultimately no runs. That's not a good combo."	Sam Fuld, who finished with two doubles, hit his first one to lead off and scored on a one-out sacrifice fly by Ben Zobrist to make it 1-0.	Graveman pitched around a pair of walks in the second and plunked Jed Lowrie with two outs in the third. But he retired Evan Gattis to end that inning.	Luis Valbuena singled with no outs in the fourth for Houston's first hit since the first inning and Jason Castro singled with one out. Graveman settled down after that to sit down the next two batters and end the threat.	Oakland manager Bob Melvin was impressed with how Graveman performed with runners on base on Tuesday night.	"For a youngster who had a tough first outing that shows you a little bit of what he's made of because you're still thinking about, to an extent, you want to get past that first outing that didn't go well," Melvin said. "And now you've got guys on base with pretty good hitters up, and to be able to make a pitch when he had to and get an out when he had to, confidence-wise that goes a long way for him."	The Astros had runners at first and second with one out in the sixth when Graveman was replaced by O'Flaherty. He quickly ended the inning when Castro grounded into a double play.	Right fielder Josh Reddick robbed Gattis of a hit when he grabbed his fly ball on the warning track in  the eighth inning. Valbuena and Carter hit consecutive singles after that, but they were stranded when Reddick caught a long fly ball hit by Castro.	Reddick had an RBI single for the Athletics in the ninth inning.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: Houston starter Brett Oberholtzer, who opened the season on the disabled list with a blister on his left index finger, could throw off the mound soon after playing long toss without a bandage on his injured finger for the second straight day on Tuesday.	FIRST PITCH	Former Houston Rocket and seven-time NBA All-Star Tracy McGrady threw out the ceremonial first pitch before the game. McGrady, who pitched briefly last season for the Sugar Land Skeeters in the Independent Atlantic League, threw a strike.	UP NEXT	Athletics: Left-hander Drew Pomeranz looks to extend a 15-inning scoreless streak dating back to last season when he makes his second start. He tied a career high with seven scoreless frames in a 12-0 win over Seattle on Friday.	Astros: Collin McHugh will try to stretch his career-long winning streak to nine games in his second start. He allowed one run in six innings against Texas on Friday to give him the longest winning streak by an Astros pitcher since Roy Oswalt won nine straight from Aug. 23, 2006-April 17, 2007.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

LOS ANGELES --  Howie Kendrick's first game-ending hit for the Los Angeles Dodgers was extra sweet because it came off a former teammate and one of the best closers in the game.	Kendrick drove in two runs with a broken-bat two-run single in the ninth against Fernando Rodney to lead the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 6-5 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Tuesday night.	"I just wanted to get a pitch I could hit, something up," Kendrick said. "If anything's down with that changeup he throws, it's tough because it's such a great pitch. So I had to stay honest, for the most part. My previous at-bat I kind of got outside of what I was trying to do, but that at-bat, I went back to my normal approach."	Rodney (1-1), who led the majors last season with 48 saves, was charged with his first blown save in three attempts. Justin Turner started the rally with a leadoff single, took third on Jimmy Rollins' single and was erased in a rundown after third baseman Kyle Seager fielded Carl Crawford's single. Adrian Gonzalez walked to load the bases and Kendrick slapped the next pitch the other way to right field.	"I knew he was going to swing, but the pitch was up a little bit in the zone and that's why he took the ball the other way," Rodney said. "I tried to throw the sinker in to try and get a ground ball and get out of the inning, but they got me tonight. It's only the eighth game of the season, so I'm just going to try to prepare myself for tomorrow and be ready."	It was the second walkoff win in two nights for the defending NL West champions. On Monday, Alex Guerrero gave the Dodgers a 6-5 win with a bases-loaded RBI single in the 10th inning.	"It's just about building character in guys, and I think this says a lot about the character of the guys in here," Kendrick said. "The past couple of days we've had wins like this, coming from behind. And I think once you start doing that, guys realize that you really can't give up on the game -- especially early -- because you've still got a lot of the game left.	"So even if we give up some runs early in the game, we still can inch our way back later. And the more we do come back and keep having the games that we've had, you get that confidence, and then it continues to overflow."	Yimi Garcia (2-0) recorded his second big league victory in as many nights with a perfect ninth inning.	Nelson Cruz homered for the fourth straight game to match the longest streak of his career and Robinson Cano hit his first home run of the season for the Mariners. Starter Hisashi Iwakuma allowed four runs and six hits in five innings, struck out five and walked three.	David Huff gave up four runs and seven hits through four innings in his Dodgers debut. The left-hander, who signed as a free agent in January, made his first start since Sept. 29, 2013 with the New York Yankees.	Guerrero, who hit his first major league home run on Sunday, pinch-hit for Huff in the fourth and cut Seattle's lead to 4-3 with a homer to left-center after a two-out walk to Joc Pederson.	But Juan Nicasio walked three of his first four batters in the fifth after relieving Huff, and Cruz scored the Mariners' fifth run on a groundout by Willie Bloomquist.	Andre Ethier got the Dodgers a run closer in the sixth with his first homer of the season, a drive just inside the right field pole on Iwakuma's 95th and final pitch.	Cruz, who signed a four-year, $47 million, contract with the Mariners in December after leading the majors with a career-high 40 homers last season for Baltimore, drove a 3-2 pitch over the glove of a leaping Crawford at the left field fence in the first after a two-run shot to right by Cano.	Twenty of the Mariners' first 28 runs this season had come on homers before Rickie Weeks increased their lead to 4-1 in the fourth with a two-out RBI single.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: Felix Hernandez, whose second start of the season on Sunday at Oakland ended after five innings because of tightness in his right quadriceps, will throw a side session on Wednesday before it is determined if he can make his scheduled outing against Texas Saturday at Safeco Field. The 2010 AL Cy Young Award winner and five-time All-Star pitched at least 200-innings in each of the previous seven seasons. "He played catch yesterday and felt fine," McClendon said. "I don't foresee any setbacks tomorrow, but I just want to cover myself."	Dodgers: RF Yasiel Puig did not play because of tightness in his left hamstring, following his second consecutive game with a home run. He felt discomfort rounding first base on his single in the seventh inning.	UP NEXT:	Mariners: RHP Taijuan Walker (0-1) was 4-0 in spring training, allowing just two earned runs over 27 innings before surrendering nine runs and nine hits in 3 1/3 innings last Friday at Oakland in his first start of the season.	Dodgers: LHP Brett Anderson (0-0) threw 94 pitches over six innings in a no-desision at Arizona last Friday. His seven career wins against Seattle are the most he's had against any opponent.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN DIEGO --  Padres starter Odrisamer Despaigne didn't let manager Bud Black down.	"You feel comfortable with him," Black said. "You know you are going to get a workmanlike outing."	Despaigne, throwing various speed from different angles, worked over the Arizona Diamondbacks Tuesday in a 5-1 win. Despaigne (1-0) allowed one run, two hits, two walks and one hit batter.	He struck out three and at one point retired 10 straight batters. He was starting for the first time this season in place of the injured Ian Kennedy.	"It felt good," the Cuban Despaigne said through an interpreter. "I threw a strike on the first pitch and that set the tone for the game."	Jeremy Hellickson (0-2), who settled down after a rocky first inning, lost in his first start at Petco Park.	"I definitely have to be more efficient and attack in the first couple of innings," Hellickson said.	Despaigne was effective at Petco last year and proved it again against the Diamondbacks. Last season he was 3-1 with a 1.69 ERA in eight home starts.	His velocity on Tuesday ranged from in the 60s to the 90s as he kept Arizona guessing at what would come next. Among the mysteries during the Padres' spring training was which pitcher would win the No. 5 spot in the rotation.	Brandon Morrow edged Despaigne for that role, but when Kennedy hurt his hamstring, Despaigne was quickly elevated from long reliever.	"Obviously I would prefer to start," Despaigne said. "But I'm a pitcher and whatever the team wants me to do, I will do."	Arizona manager Chip Hale was impressed.	"He just mixed his pitches really well," Hale said. "We had a hard time. We just couldn't crack the code I guess, today. So give him credit."	The Padres went ahead 5-1 in the seventh inning when Matt Kemp tripled, his second hit of the game, and scored on a wild pitch. Justin Upton's fifth-inning home run into the second deck of the left-field seats extended the Padres lead to 4-1 and his hitting streak to nine games.	Arizona, which only had three hits, scored with one out in the fourth when Despaigne hit David Peralta with a pitch and Mark Trumbo followed with a booming double to left-center. But second baseman Yangervis Solarte made a diving stop on a groundball up the middle by Jake Lamb for an out and Tuffy Gosewisch popped up to Derek Norris in foul territory.	"He threw a mix of pitches from various arm angles and was effective, around the plate," Black said. "He was good, he was crisp; that was a good one."	The Padres struck early, scoring three runs in the first inning, as Hellickson struggled with his command. Wil Myers opened with a double, followed by Solarte's infield single. Kemp drove in Myers on a fielder's choice and Upton walked. Norris' double scored Kemp and Upton got home on Alonso's RBI groundout.	"When I give up three runs in the first, I don't give the guys a chance to get the lead," Hellickson said. "So I've just got to be better."	Hale said the Padres' early offense aided Despaigne.	Black might need assistance with his rotation when Kennedy is fit. Morrow threw seven scoreless innings in his first outing, so the Padres have a surplus of starters.	"These are good problems to have," Black said.	TRAINERS ROOM	Padres: Manager Bud Black said RHP Ian Kennedy, on the DL with a strained left hamstring, is expected to throw a bullpen session on Wednesday.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: RHP Chase Anderson (0-0, 5.40) is making his second start after not figuring in the 4-3 win over the Dodgers on April 10. He allowed three runs in five innings. In three starts against the Padres, Anderson is 2-1 with a 4.20 ERA.	Padres: RHP Brandon Morrow (0-0, 0.00) is making his second Padres start after throwing seven shutout innings against the Giants on April 10; the Padres won 1-0. It was the first time Morrow worked seven scoreless innings since Sept. 27, 2012 against the Mets, when he pitched for the Blue Jays.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Nolan Arenado's spectacular falling catch over the tarp in foul territory is right up there with the greatest longtime baseball men Walt Weiss and Rene Lachemann have ever seen. Arenado might need to wait a little while to watch the highlights -- and there will be many -- because Colorado's third baseman is just thankful he didn't get hurt and realizes how frightening it might have been.	Arenado made what will certainly go down as one of the top catches of 2015, Corey Dickerson had an RBI single among his three hits and the Rockies established their best road start in franchise history with a 4-1 win against the San Francisco Giants on Tuesday night.	"I'm just so thankful I didn't get hurt," Arenado said. "It was a scary play. To be honest with you, I don't think I'd go for a ball like that ever again."	A sprinting Arenado crashed into the tarp and went over the rail along the left-field line while catching a popup by Gregor Blanco in the eighth. He immediately made the throw from his knees while still on the tarp then toppled to the dirt.	"I don't know if I've ever seen a better play than that," said Weiss, the Rockies' manager.	Veteran coach Lachemann added: "I've seen a lot of them. That's one of the best catches I've seen in a long time. He's a web gem every night."	He nearly threw out Angel Pagan at third for a double play. Arenado had 60 messages waiting on his phone and he counted on his cousins to send replays from every angle.	"It's a great play. It was awesome," he said, admittedly a little sore all over.	Center fielder Charlie Blackmon followed with his own gem when he chased down a deep fly at the fence to rob pinch-hitter Buster Posey to end the inning.	Scott Oberg (1-0) pitched the fifth for the win in his major league debut as the Rockies moved to 5-0 on the road to start a season for the first time. They sent the reigning World Series champions to a fifth straight defeat.	San Francisco ended an 18-inning scoreless streak on Matt Duffy's eighth-inning sacrifice fly. The Giants, who lost their AT&T Park opener 2-0 on Monday, avoided being shut out in consecutive home games to start the season for the first time in San Francisco history.	"We have some guys that are really, really pressing right now," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "It's pretty obvious looking at the at-bats."	LaTroy Hawkins pitched a perfect sixth a day after Weiss moved him out of the closer job for now. Hawkins surrendered a two-run homer to the Cubs' Dexter Fowler in a 6-5 loss Sunday to Chicago.	Adam Ottavino finished for his first save. The Giants have stranded 21 baserunners in the first two games of the series.	Tim Hudson made his home debut but didn't get a single run of support for the second straight start. The right-hander is planning to retire after this season, his 17th in the majors. Hudson (0-1) dropped to 5-3 against Colorado and didn't have a decision in four 2014 starts against the Rockies.	Posey had most of the day off after starting the first eight games -- two of those at first -- and he is likely to play first base Wednesday night with backup Hector Sanchez behind the plate for a second straight day.	Christian Bergman allowed four hits and no runs in four shutout innings but was done after reaching his pitch count of 85. He is winless in five career road starts.	San Francisco's Nori Aoki extended his career-best hitting streak dating to last season to 17 games with a fifth-inning single.	World Series MVP Madison Bumgarner was honored for his special October in a pregame ceremony that included the presentation of his Silver Slugger award and The Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year award. Posey also received his Silver Slugger plaque.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rockies: Jorge De La Rosa, on the DL with a strained left groin, struck out five in his second rehab game for Triple-A Albuquerque at home against Tacoma.	Giants: RF Hunter Pence had another X-ray on his fractured left forearm and there's still no target date when he will swing a bat. RHP Matt Cain is about a week away from throwing as he nurses a strained flexor tendon in his forearm.	UP NEXT	Rockies:  LHP Tyler Matzek (0-0) looks for his first win of 2015 after winning in San Francisco his only other outing against the Giants, last Aug. 25.	Giants: RHP Tim Lincecum (0-0) tries for his first win of the season after seven scoreless innings in his season debut Friday at San Diego.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CLEVELAND --  The Indians salvaged the finale of a miserable opening homestand.	Trevor Bauer won consecutive starts for the first time in his three-plus seasons in the major leagues, helping Cleveland beat the Chicago White Sox 4-2 Wednesday to stop a four-game losing streak.	"It's huge for team morale," Bauer said after the Indians' first home victory this year. "We had a rough homestand, but we battled through today."	Cleveland lost its first four home games and lost three players to injuries. Left fielder Michael Brantley missed the final four games with a sore back, and catcher Yan Gomes sprained his right knee, an injury likely to sideline him for two months. Pitcher Carlos Carrasco sustained a bruised jaw after being hit in the face with a line drive Tuesday.	Bauer (2-0), who pitched six hitless innings against Houston in his first start this season, held the White Sox without a hit until Jose Abreu singled leading off the fourth. Chicago loaded the bases with one out, but J.B. Shuck fouled out and Geovany Soto struck out.	Making his 36th big league start, Bauer gave up two runs, four hits and four walks in six innings with eight strikeouts.	"I'm trying to stay focused on attacking hitters and going after the strike zone," Bauer said. "Overall it was a little bit of a struggle, but I'm happy with the results."	Manager Terry Francona is impressed Bauer is finally showing the consistency the Indians have been waiting to see since acquiring him from Arizona before the 2013 season.	"He's got good stuff," Francona said. "He has all the pitches. I'm most impressed by the fact he's not giving up runs."	Cody Allen walked pinch-hitter Emilio Bonifacio leading off the ninth and hit Micah Johnson with a pitch. Adam Eaton struck out trying to sacrifice, Melky Cabrera hit into a forceout and Allen struck out Abreu for his second save.	Cleveland never led while getting swept by Detroit in a three-game series and trailed throughout Tuesday's loss to the White Sox.	"It was important for us to win, because we hadn't won yet," Francona said.	John Danks (0-2) gave up four runs -- three earned -- and six hits in 4 2/3 innings. Chicago had won its previous three games.	Michael Bourn's third-inning groundout gave Cleveland its first lead since last Thursday against Houston. Lonnie Chisenhall hit a two-run double in the fourth and Carlos Santana added an RBI single in the fifth.	Chicago got a pair of runs in the sixth on Alexei Ramirez's RBI groundout and Shuck's run-scoring single.	IT'S EARLY	Francona thinks what happens early in the season is magnified whether the results are positive or negative.	"That's why you work so hard in spring training regardless of what your start is, you can handle what's thrown at you and find way to win," he said. "It's nice to come out of the gate 6-0, but you don't always do that."	ROTATION SWITCH	Francona said Carrasco will make his next start Monday at the White Sox. The Indians need a starter Sunday in Minnesota. RHP Zach McAllister is a possibility.	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox: RHP Jake Petricka (right forearm strain) is on the 15-day DL but could rejoin the club in Detroit this weekend.	Indians: It is not clear when Brantley will return to the lineup. He has played in only two games and is batting .125.	UP NEXT	White Sox: RHP Jeff Samardzija will face Tigers LHP David Price in the opener of a three-game series Friday at Comerica Park. Samardzija, who is winless with a 6.23 ERA in two starts, has not pitched against Detroit in eight big league seasons.	Indians: RHP Corey Kluber will start on five days' rest Friday in Minnesota. The reigning AL Cy Young Award winner got his 14th career double-digit strikeout game in his last start but didn't figure in the decision against the Tigers.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

ATLANTA --  Dan Haren needed one inning to get used to home plate umpire Alan Porter's strike zone.	Once he started hitting his spots, Haren built momentum to keep Atlanta's hitters guessing.	Haren had two walks in the first. He approached the umpire after the third out to discuss pitch location.	"I just asked him where he had them," Haren said. "He said they were close. I told him, `I'm going to stay right there and keep pounding it.' After a while he was calling them, (and I) got in a good groove."	Haren gave up three hits in seven innings, Adeiny Hechavarria went 3 for 3 with a homer and three RBIs and the Miami Marlins beat the Atlanta Braves 6-2 on Wednesday.	With its second straight victory, Miami has its first winning streak of the season.	Haren (1-0) allowed just three base runners -- two walks in the first and an error by second baseman Dee Gordon that let Freddie Freeman reach in the fourth -- before Andrelton Simmons got the first hit off the right-hander with two outs in the fifth.	Cameron Maybin led off the Atlanta sixth with his second homer of the season to make it 5-1. Kelly Johnson led off the Braves' seventh with his first homer of the season to cut the lead to 5-2.	Haren, who was replaced by Mike Dunn to begin the eighth, walked two and struck out five. He has won four straight decisions against the Braves.	"He put a little on, took a little off, hit every location," Atlanta manager Fredi Gonzalez said of Haren. "Guys were coming back shaking their heads. He hit his spots, and it's hard to score some when you get three hits."	The Marlins went up 2-0 in the third on Gordon's two-run double. They took a 4-0 lead on Hechavarria's first homer, a two-run shot in the fifth.	Celebrating his 26th birthday, Hechavarria has gone 7 for his past 11, raising his average to .242 after beginning the season 1 for 22. He added a sacrifice fly to make it 6-2 in the ninth.	Atlanta starter Eric Stults (0-1) gave up five hits, four runs and two walks with two strikeouts in five innings.	Cody Martin, the first Braves reliever, allowed Michael Morse's first homer of the season in the sixth, which put the Marlins up 5-0.	Gordon has reached safely in eight of nine games after going 2 for 4 and raised his average 14 points to .378. Marlins manager Mike Redmond likes how Gordon's approach affected the lineup as Miami scored a combined 14 runs the past two days.	In their previous 10 games at Turner Field, the Marlins scored a combined 25 runs.	"The key to this whole thing is guys relaxing," Redmond said. "You're starting to see guys now taking a deep breath and starting to focus on having a good at-bat, square the ball up."	Miami closer Steve Cisek, pitching in a non-save situation, faced the minimum in the ninth.	Marlins slugger Giancarlo Stanton batted without a protective mask on the left side of his batting helmet when facing left-handers. Stanton, who went 0 for 4, is still wearing the mask against right-handers.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: Manager Mike Redmond said LF Christian Yelich could return to the lineup for the next game Thursday at the New York Mets. Yelich is getting heat treatments for tightness in his back. ... Ichiro Suzuki played for the second straight game in Yelich's spot, going 0 for 4.	Braves: LHP Mike Minor still hasn't thrown off a mound as he recovers from shoulder inflammation on the 15-day disabled list.	UP NEXT	Marlins: RHP Jarred Cosart (0-1) tries to win for the first time in six starts when Miami visits the New York Mets on Thursday.	Braves: RHP Julio Teheran (2-0) will face Toronto for the second time in his career and first time since June 10, 2012.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

BOSTON --  Considering the way the first two games went, the Washington Nationals found a reason to leave Boston feeling pleased.	Wilson Ramos hit a three-run double and Ian Desmond a solo homer during Washington's six-run third inning, and the Nationals beat the Red Sox 10-5 Wednesday to avoid a three-game sweep.	After losing six of their first eight games and misplaying a pair of flyballs and committing four errors during two losses at Fenway Park, the Nationals headed home after an easy win.	"Leaving now on a positive note," winning pitcher Gio Gonzalez said. "We should have a happy flight."	Tyler Moore had a two-run homer that helped back Gonzalez (1-1), who gave up five runs -- four earned -- and six hits in six innings. Nationals right-hander Rafael Martin pitched two scoreless innings in his major league debut, striking out his last five batters.	"We just continue to work hard and try to get better everyday," said Desmond, whose bobble in the series opener led to a run. "It's just baseball. It's crazy. It'll rack your brain and make your food taste bad."	Boston starter Wade Miley (0-1) gave up seven runs, five hits and three walks over 2 1/3 innings in his Fenway debut.	"Things unraveled pretty quick on him," Boston manager John Farrell said. "They squared up some fastballs to the opposite field and then a couple of sliders that didn't get to the spot, one to Desmond, one to Ramos."	Hanley Ramirez hit his fourth homer, a two-run drive.	With the score tied at 2-all, the Nationals chased Miley and had four extra-base hits en route to their six runs. Desmond led off with a home run that hit a billboard above the Green Monster seat in left. After Washington loaded the bases on Jayson Werth's single and two walks, Ramos knocked out Miley with his bases-clearing double down the left-field line.	"Really the whole outing wasn't very good," Miley said. "I never established the strike zone, got behind in a lot of counts and that's what's going to happen."	Dan Uggla and Michael A. Taylor added consecutive RBI doubles to make it 8-2.	Ramirez hit a line drive into the Monster seats in the fifth.	Bryce Harper doubled in a run in the first and scored on Ryan Zimmerman's triple.	Boston tied it with two in the second. Shane Victorino had an RBI single and scored on Sandy Leon's groundout.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: Washington placed RHP Craig Stammen on the 15-day DL with right forearm stiffness. ... OF Denard Span (right core muscle surgery) played seven innings in his first rehab game with Double-A Harrisburg on Tuesday night. He is expected to play nine in his next one.	Red Sox: Xander Bogaerts was back in the lineup after missing Tuesday's game with a sore right knee. He tested it by running in the morning after a clean MRI on Tuesday. ... Farrell said 3B Pablo Sandoval, who left Tuesday's game with a bruised left foot after being hit by a pitch, "could have played."	UP NEXT	Nationals: Doug Fister (0-0, 0.00 ERA) faces the Phillies' Cole Hamels (0-1, 3.75) for the second time this season on Thursday. Fister pitched 6 1/3 scoreless innings in their last meeting. Hamels gave up a run over seven innings.	Red Sox: They are off Thursday before Joe Kelly (1-0, 1.29) faces Baltimore's Ubaldo Jimenez (1-0, 0.00) when the clubs open a four-game series in Fenway on Friday.	REMEMBERING TWO YEARS AGO	The game was halted for a moment of silence at 2:49 P.M., when the first of two bombs exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon two years ago. The bombs killed three people and injured 260 others.	"I think it's an extremely worthy pause in today's game," Farrell said before the game. "We'll pause for that moment and recall where we were at that specific moment."	Bombing survivors Jeff Bauman and Patrick Downes threw out ceremonial first pitches and other survivors were on the field before the game.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Mike Trout helped convince Hector Santiago into getting a reverse Mohawk after the left-hander lost his first start and the Los Angeles Angels were swept in their first home series.	"Stay in your lane," Santiago said, explaining what the haircut symbolized. "Just like I draw the lane out on the mound. Stay straight ahead."	Santiago never seems to need much direction in Texas, where he has never lost as a starter after the Angels' series-clinching 10-2 win over the Rangers on Wednesday.	Trout had three hits, scored twice and drove in a run for the Angels, who took two of three at Texas after losing three straight at home to defending AL champion Kansas City.	Los Angeles has won 15 of its last 19 games against Texas -- and 11 of 13 in Arlington. The Angels had season highs for runs and hits (13).	"We went out there and put some runs on the board for Santiago." Trout said. "One through nine is coming in."	Santiago (1-1) allowed one run and four hits over seven innings, with five strikeouts and two walks. The left-hander is 4-0 with a 2.15 ERA in five career starts at Texas, one win came with the Chicago White Sox in 2013. He joined the Angels last season.	Los Angeles went ahead to stay with a six-run second off Anthony Ranaudo (0-1), the right-hander making his Texas debut while starting in place of injured Derek Holland. Ranaudo was recalled from Round Rock before the game, then optioned back to the Triple-A team afterward.	While the Angels had their early offensive outburst, Santiago went down in the tunnel because he didn't want to know how big of a lead he had.	"I know we're up. As long as I give up zeroes, I know we're in a good place," he said. "I gave up the home run, but I didn't see exactly where we were at. Even in the seventh inning, I didn't know the score until I came out of the game."	By that point, it was 10-1.	Erick Aybar had a sacrifice squeeze bunt that plated a run in the second before Trout drew a two-out walk and scored on Matt Joyce's double that made it 6-0 and chase Ranaudo. It was 7-0 after Trout's RBI single in the fourth.	Albert Pujols had a pair of RBI singles and David Freese added a two-run single for the Angels.	The only run allowed by Santiago came when Carlos Corporan lined a homer into the right-field seats in the fifth inning. It was Corporan's first homer.	In the previous five games, Angels starters had been tagged for 22 earned runs over 24 1/3 innings.	Adam Rosales homered in the ninth for Texas, snapping an 0-for-24 drought that went back to last season.	Texas acquired Ranaudo from the Red Sox in January. He allowed six runs and six hits, with two strikeouts and two walks, in 1 2/3 innings.	"Even the ones that I did deliver for a strike were up in the zone, kind of thigh high, and I didn't have command of my secondary pitches too good," he said. "They were sitting on those fastballs."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: Right-hander Garrett Richards (rehabbing after left knee surgery) is expected to join the team in Houston, and could start Sunday against the Astros. He threw 91 pitches over five innings in a rehab start Tuesday for Triple-A Salt Lake. "His stuff looked good," Scioscia said. "He fielded a bunt, covered first, showed a little agility there, which is as important as anything we're talking about."	Rangers: Right-hander Lisalverto Bonilla had Tommy John surgery Wednesday, and also had bone spurs removed from his elbow. The Rangers said the surgery went as expected. ... Right-hander Kyuji Fujikawa (groin) pitched an inning Tuesday for Double-A Frisco, and continue rehab with Triple-A Round Rock on Friday. ... Left-handers Martin Perez (Tommy John surgery) and Matt Harrison (spinal fusion) will continue rehab in extended spring training in Surprise, Arizona, starting Friday.	UP NEXT	Angels: Los Angeles gets a day off Thursday before the opener of a three-game series in Houston on Friday.	Rangers: After playing 10 straight days, Texas has its first off day of the season Thursday. The Rangers open a three-game series at Seattle on Friday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

BALTIMORE -- The New York Yankees had a one-run lead when manager Joe Girardi turned to his bullpen against the Baltimore Orioles at the start of the sixth inning.	Two outs and three relievers later, Baltimore was well on its way to a 7-5 victory Wednesday night.	Jonathan Schoop homered to spark a five-run sixth and Chris Davis had three RBIs for the Orioles, who took two of three from New York.	"It's big," Davis said. "It's nice to be tested early in the year. We're playing our division pretty much this whole month, and it's good to kind of see where we're at and get a chance to see these guys."	Manny Machado hit his first home run of the season and Caleb Joseph went 3 for 4 with an RBI for the Orioles.	Alex Rodriguez homered for the Yankees, his second following a yearlong drug suspension. But last-place New York lost its third straight series to start the season, all within the AL East.	"It's frustrating. It's not the way you want to start out," Girardi said. "Obviously we need to start winning series or it becomes a long year."	Yankees starter Nathan Eovaldi struck out nine over five innings and left with a 3-2 lead. The right-hander was in position to end a run of eight straight losses, a streak that started last August with the Marlins, but the New York bullpen couldn't hold the advantage.	David Carpenter (0-1) gave up a leadoff homer to Schoop and Delmon Young greeted reliever Tom Wilson with a pinch-hit RBI single. Davis followed with a two-run double and Joseph capped the uprising with a run-scoring single off Chris Martin.	"You're winning after five and you have got a full bullpen, you feel pretty good about it," Girardi said. "We just couldn't seem to get through that sixth inning."	New York's bullpen came in with a 1.73 ERA.	"We have some great arms in there," Eovaldi said. "It was just one of those nights."	Brad Brach (1-0) pitched two innings of hitless relief for Baltimore following starter Bud Norris, who allowed three runs in five innings. Norris was attempting to become the third pitcher in history to win his first five starts against the Yankees.	New York got a run-scoring fly from Brian McCann in the eighth, and another run scored on a wild pitch by Tommy Hunter.	Zach Britton worked the ninth for his third save.	It was apparent early on that neither starting pitcher was going to be very effective.	After Davis snapped an 0-for-10 skid with an RBI single in the first inning, New York went up 2-1 in the third. Norris retired the first two batters before Carlos Beltran hit a two-run double off the top of the wall in right-center.	Rodriguez sent a 2-0 pitch deep into the left-field seats in the fourth, the 656th home run of his career, and Machado hit a solo shot in the bottom half before Eovaldi worked out of a bases-loaded jam.	CATCHING UP	Yankees: Catcher McCann went 0 for 7 in the series and backup John Ryan Murphy went 1 for 3. McCann is batting .200 for the season.	Orioles: Joseph was 7 for 11 with two RBIs in the series and is batting .375. Baltimore is 19-1 when the catcher has an RBI, one reason why the Orioles aren't rushing back Matt Wieters, who's on the DL following elbow surgery last June.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: OF Brett Gardner missed a second straight game since being hit with a pitch on his right wrist Monday. He hopes to return Friday following an off day. Also, LH Chris Capuano (strained right quadriceps) is still about a month away from coming off the DL, Girardi said.	Orioles: Utility player Jimmy Paredes (back) and shortstop J.J. Hardy (left shoulder strain) both could start a rehabilitation assignment with Class AA Bowie on Friday, manager Buck Showalter said.	UP NEXT	Yankees: New York sends RH Adam Warren (0-1, 1.69 ERA) to the mound Friday night in the opener of a three-game series at Tampa Bay.	Orioles: Following an off day Thursday, the Orioles open a four-game series in Boston. Each game has a different starting time: 7:10 p.m., 4:05 p.m., 1:35 p.m. and 11:05 a.m.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PITTSBURGH --  There's nothing fancy about the way Alfredo Simon does his job. The Detroit Tigers right-hander doesn't overwhelm batters with power or baffle them with deception. Instead, Simon just rears back and throws, trusting his defense to handle the bulk of the work.	"He doesn't get rattled," manager Brad Ausmus said. "I don't think his heartbeat gets up over 60 beats a minute."	Considering how easily Simon dispatched the Pittsburgh Pirates on Wednesday, overexertion was hardly necessary. Simon held Pittsburgh to two hits over eight solid innings as the Tigers held on for a 1-0 win to improve to 8-1 on the season.	"I just felt really comfortable today," Simon said. "When I was behind in counts I just tried to throw my slider for a strike, tried to throw that and tried to put the ball in play. The key was, when I was behind in the count, just try a different pitch."	Detroit won two of three in the interleague series despite scoring just seven runs. Simon (2-0) struck out only two but took advantage of solid defense behind him as the Tigers handed Pittsburgh consecutive home losses for the first time since last August.	Rajai Davis hit a leadoff homer in the sixth against Francisco Liriano (0-1) as Detroit shut out Pittsburgh for the second straight day. Joakim Soria worked a perfect ninth for his fourth save while filling in for injured Joe Nathan.	Detroit had just five hits off four Pittsburgh pitchers but received all the offense it would need when Davis hit his first home run of the season, turning on an 81 mph slider by Liriano for the 36th homer of his decade-long career.	"I did reach a little bit but I felt like off the bat I'm hoping that would go," Davis said.  "It felt good off the bat."	A night after managing just three hits against Shane Greene in a 2-0 loss, the Pirates weren't any better against Simon. A surprise All-Star a year ago for Cincinnati, the beefy 33-year-old breezed through Pittsburgh's punchless lineup after surviving an eventful 5 1/3 innings in his debut with Detroit last Friday.	Simon didn't allow a hit until consecutive two-out singles by Andrew McCutchen and Neil Walker in the fourth. Starling Marte grounded into a fielders' choice to end the threat and Simon went right back to work, retiring the final 10 batters he faced the Pirates' early offensive funk grew deeper. They're batting just .207 and haven't even earned a walk since Saturday.	"We're just a tick off and sometimes a tick off is a lot at the major-league level," Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said.	EARLY EXIT	Home plate umpire Jerry Layne left the game in the top of the ninth inning when an 88 mph cutter from Mark Melancon struck Layne's mask. Layne pointed to his mouth in obvious pain and the game was delayed for several minutes as the crew tried to figure out what happened. There was some apparent confusion over whether Layne called the pitch from Melancon to Miguel Cabrera a strike or ball four.	"Jerry wasn't in the best position to explain," Hurdle said. "Hunter (Wendelstedt) said `I thought he said foul tip and he said `chipped tooth.' He just said it was a hard conversation to have."	After a lengthy review Cabrera was awarded first base. Second-base umpire Bob Davidson called the rest of the game in Layne's place.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: Pitcher Justin Verlander's return from a strained right triceps hit a speedbump on Wednesday when he ended a simulated game early due to fatigue. Verlander threw 80 pitches total, 35 in the bullpen and another 45 on the mound. Ausmus said Verlander will likely need another simulated game or a rehab start before he's ready to be activated off the disabled list but said any decision on Verlander's status won't be made until at least Friday. ... Nathan threw batting practice on Wednesday without any issues as he works his way back from a right flexor strain.	Pirates: Pitcher Charlie Morton will make a start at extended spring training on Saturday, where he will be on a 55-pitch limit. Morton is returning from offseason hip surgery.	UP NEXT	Tigers: David Price (1-0) takes a 21 2/3 regular season scoreless inning streak into Friday's game at the Chicago White Sox. Price hasn't given up a run in his last three regular season starts. The 29-year-old Price is 7-2 with a 2.89 ERA in 12 career games (10 starts) at Comerica Park.	Pirates: Pittsburgh gets a second look at Milwaukee when the teams open a three-game series at PNC Park on Friday. The Pirates won two of three against the Brewers on the road last week.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

TORONTO --  Even though he's a rookie, Devon Travis has had little trouble recognizing that he is in a really good situation with the Blue Jays.	Jose Bautista, Travis and rookie Dalton Pompey homered to back Mark Buehrle, Kevin Pillar made a leaping catch at the left-field wall to deny a home run and Toronto beat Tampa Bay 12-7 Wednesday night to stop the Rays' four-game winning streak.	"It's just a really fun lineup and it's great to be a part of it," said Travis, who had three hits and two RBIs. It was the first multihit game of his career.	Bautista hit a two-run homer in the first off Erasmo Ramirez (0-2), sparking the Blue Jays to what would be an 9-0 lead after four innings. Donaldson hit a two-run single in a three-run second after narrowly missing a grand slam down the left-field line.	"Again, I was just having trouble with the location," said Ramirez, who gave up nine runs -- seven earned -- eight hits and three walks, needing 91 pitches to get 10 outs. He has a 23.63 ERA.	Pillar and Travis added RBI singles in the third, and Justin Smoak singled in two runs in the fourth -- his first RBIs for the Blue Jays.	Pillar climbed the left-field wall and jumped at full extension with his glove 6 inches above the top of the fence to deny Tim Beckham a home run in the seventh.	"I'm pretty amazed by it," said Pillar, who also had two hits and an RBI. "I watched it a couple times on my phone when I got in. It's going to be tough to top making a play like that in my career.	"I'm just thankful I had an opportunity to rob a home run in the big leagues," he added.	Donaldson had three hits and three RBIs before a crowd of 15,086, the Blue Jays' smallest at the Rogers Centre since 14,086 against Cleveland last May 14, according to STATS.	Buehrle (2-0) allowed three runs and seven hits in six innings to gain his 201st win. Steven Souza Jr. hit a solo home run in the fifth, Mikie Mahtook had a two-run homer in the sixth for his first career hit,	"Buehrle is just out there to win," said Jays manager John Gibbons. "He doesn't get caught up in stats, or quality starts, it's all about winning.  It's why he's had the career he has."	Ramirez (0-1) gave up nine runs -- seven earned -- eight hits and three walks, needing 91 pitches to get 10 outs. He has a 23.63 ERA.	Toronto had been held to three runs in two losses open the four-game series, the Blue Jays' first at home this season.	Souza hit a two-run single against Todd Redmond in a four-run ninth.	"It seems like those just misses are becoming just connections now," Rays manager Kevin Cash said of Souza, who hit back-to-back homers for the first time in his career. "It's good to see."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: LHP Jake McGee, who had offseason elbow surgery, is expected to pitch in an extended spring game on Thursday after throwing 30 pitches of batting practice on Monday. ... RHP Alex Colome, recovering from pneumonia, is scheduled to make his second rehab appearance for Class A Charlotte against Daytona on Thursday.	Blue Jays OF Michael Saunders, who is rehabbing his injured left knee, missed his third straight game with Class A Dunedin on Wednesday. He left Sunday's game after aggravating his right hamstring.	UP NEXT	Rays RHP Chris Archer (1-1) starts the series finale Thursday. Archer has allowed three earned runs or fewer in 14 consecutive road starts dating to May 14 last year at the Los Angeles Angels, which ties him for the club record set by Jeremy Hellickson from April 19, 2012, to April 15, 2013. RHP Aaron Sanchez (0-1) goes for the Blue Jays; he lasted 3 1/3 innings against Baltimore Orioles in his first career start last Saturday.	SILENT TREATMENT	Rays rookie Mike Mahtook was given the traditional silent treatment from his teammates when he got back to the dugout after his first career hit -- a two-run homer -- in the sixth.	"You've got to just go with it, act like they were giving me high-fives," he said with a laugh. "It was a fun experience."	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK --  There was the home opener a couple of days ago. Matt Harvey's return to Citi Field. And then the first game since David Wright got hurt.	The New York Mets rose to every occasion.	Travis d'Arnaud homered after assuming Wright's spot in the lineup, Lucas Duda also went deep and the Mets defeated the Philadelphia Phillies 6-1 Wednesday night for a three-game sweep in their first home series this season.	"I look at today's game as a very big game for us with the loss of David," manager Terry Collins said. "I wanted to see how the guys came out. They came out this afternoon ready to go."	Jonathon Niese pitched out of trouble for 6 1/3 innings and helped himself with a run-scoring single.	Duda hit a long homer and an RBI double as the Mets won their fourth straight, matching their longest winning streak last year, a few hours after putting their captain on the 15-day disabled list with a strained right hamstring.	"We're going to go through a lot more adversity this year. This is just one speed bump in the road and we're going to be able to get through it. We've got a good team," Niese said. "We're going to be able to pick him up."	Wright was injured while stealing second base the night before and is expected back within three weeks. In his absence, d'Arnaud was bumped up to second in the batting order for the first time in his career and broke a 1-all tie in the third with a leadoff shot down the left-field line.	Saying he was fired up by a move that "meant the world" to him and kicked him into another gear, d'Arnaud explained: "It's nice to have Big Dude behind me."	Duda hit the first pitch in the fifth from Jerome Williams (0-1) over the original wall in right-center that is 415 feet from home plate at Citi Field. Juan Lagares had an RBI single, and the Mets got another run on a throwing error by third baseman Cody Asche.	Niese (1-0) worked around nine hits and two walks as the slumping Phillies had their latest miserable performance with runners in scoring position.	"He knows how to get outs when he needs them," Collins said.	Philadelphia has dropped four in a row overall and 20 of its past 26 meetings with the NL East rival Mets.	"It's going to come. It's still early. There's no need for us to panic and knee-jerk reactions, but we need a big hit. I think that would help us out," Asche said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: OF Domonic Brown (left Achilles tendinitis) has been rehabbing with Class A Clearwater and is getting close to having his assignment moved to Triple-A Lehigh Valley. "I'm not sure if it's today or tomorrow. It could be that soon," Philadelphia manager Ryne Sandberg said. "The plan right now is to get some upper-level at-bats." ... RHP Chad Billingsley (elbow surgery) pitched five scoreless innings of two-hit ball Wednesday morning in a rehab start for Lehigh Valley against Syracuse. "Progressing well," Sandberg said.	Mets: Cleanup hitter Michael Cuddyer was back in the lineup after leaving Tuesday night's game when he was hit by a pitch on the left hand. ... New York closer Jeurys Familia was unavailable after earning three saves in three days. ... Eric Campbell was recalled from Triple-A Las Vegas to replace Wright at third base. Campbell singled in his first major league at-bat of the year.	GOT YOUR NUMBER	Niese is 4-0 with a 1.87 ERA in his last six starts against Philadelphia, swept in a three-game series at Citi Field for the first time since May 2010.	"Nothing came easy," Niese said. "Our offense did a great job."	JACKIE ROBINSON DAY	Mets outfielder Curtis Granderson wore customized spikes in Brooklyn Dodgers colors with No. 42 and the letters JRD on the side. They will be auctioned off, with the proceeds going to the Jackie Robinson Foundation.	UP NEXT	Phillies: LHP Cole Hamels (0-1) makes his third start of the season Thursday night at Washington.	Mets: The opener of a four-game series against visiting Miami. RHP Dillon Gee is 3-1 with a 2.84 ERA in six starts against the Marlins and has not given up a home run to them since Aug. 29, 2011. He has held Giancarlo Stanton to one hit (a homer) in nine at-bats.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CHICAGO --  Two years ago, Travis Wood was an All-Star. This year, he's a pitcher looking to return that form following a rough 2014 season.	"This game will always sneak up and find a way to bite ya," Wood said. "I had that pretty much all last year. Now I just try to go with each start and take it pitch by pitch."	That approach worked beautifully Wednesday night.	Wood pitched three-hit ball into the eighth inning and Anthony Rizzo hit his first home run of the season, leading the Chicago Cubs to a 5-0 victory over the Cincinnati Reds.	The Cubs (5-3) won two of three games in the series and moved back into first place in the National League Central.	Wood (1-1) walked two and struck out seven. It was a nice bounce-back from his first start of the season in Colorado where he yielded three runs on seven hits in 4 2/3 innings -- and his 2014 campaign when he was 8-13 with a 5.03 ERA.	New Cubs manager Joe Maddon didn't see the 2014 version of Wood up close, but likes what he sees now.	"He's different, man," Maddon said. "As pitchers go, you could kind of label him as a dirtbag. I kind of love that phrase when you're talking about a good baseball player. He is that. No excuses, ready to go. `Give me the ball, I'm fine."	Cincinnati starter Jason Marquis (0-1) was in trouble from the outset, allowing five runs -four earned -- on seven hits in four innings.	"He just wasn't as sharp as he was before," Reds manager Bryan Price said. "He had good action on his ball, he just didn't command it as well."	The Cubs have had a knack for scoring late so far this season, but wasted no time jumping on top in this one. Leadoff hitter Dexter Fowler began the bottom of the first with a double and trotted home as the next batter, Rizzo, homered into the right-field bleachers that are still under construction for a 2-0 lead.	The Cubs added two more in the second. Jonathan Herrera singled in a run and the other run scored when Jorge Soler -- after Rizzo was intentionally walked -- was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded.	The Cubs stretched the lead to 5-0 in the fourth on a bases-loaded sacrifice fly by Miguel Montero.	TRAINER'S ROOM	REDS: RHP Homer Bailey (right forearm) threw a bullpen session and is expected to start Saturday against the St. Louis Cardinals. ... C Devin Mesoraco (left hip) remained in Cincinnati and missed his third consecutive game. Reds manager Bryan Price said the team would evaluate him Thursday and didn't rule out putting the catcher on the disabled list. ... One night after leaving due to "lightheadedness," 2B Brandon Phillips was in the Reds lineup.	CUBS: RHP Neil Ramirez left the game with an injury after throwing just three pitches in the ninth... 3B Mike Olt (right wrist) didn't start. He was hit by a pitch last weekend against the Colorado Rockies.	ALL ABOUT BRYANT	Maddon said he hasn't been given a date for the call-up of prized prospect Kris Bryant. Maddon said the decision about where Bryant will play -- either third base or left field -- will be his call but "I definitely like to accumulate data."	UP NEXT	Reds: Start a three-game series Friday in St. Louis. Johnny Cueto (0-1, 0.64) faces Michael Wacha (1-0, 1.42) and a Cardinals team that he has allowed five earned runs to in 20 innings last season.	Cubs: Starting a series Friday against the San Diego Padres. Jason Hammel (1-0, 4.50) faces San Diego's James Shields (1-0, 2.08), who pitched for Cubs manager Joe Maddon in Tampa Bay.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MINNEAPOLIS --  The Kansas City Royals were rolling through the start of the season, still undefeated when they took the field Wednesday at Minnesota.	Well, Kyle Gibson hadn't lost either, at least not against the Royals in his young career.	Kansas City became the last team in the majors to lose this season, as Gibson pitched into the seventh inning and Oswaldo Arcia hit a two-run homer for the Twins in a 3-1 victory over the Royals.	"I think they knew they were going to lose at some point," Gibson said. "It was nice for us. Getting a win like that for us was hopefully some good momentum."	The Twins (2-6) sure needed it. They went 1-8 to begin the 1994 season, the only other time in the club's 55-year history they started with seven losses in their first eight games. But Brian Duensing and Casey Fien backed up Gibson when manager Paul Molitor went to the bullpen, and Glen Perkins pitched a perfect ninth for his first save.	"It looked a lot more like the team that we thought we had coming out of spring. I know you don't put a lot into the losses or one win, but when you get a good starting pitching performance it just makes everybody's job a little bit easier," Molitor said.	Lorenzo Cain bounced into a double play after consecutive singles to start the game, and Salvador Perez grounded into an inning-ending turn-two by the Twins in the second. Alcides Escobar had three of the nine hits against Gibson and Alex Gordon drove in a run with a two-out single in the fourth inning, but the right-hander didn't walk anybody after issuing five free passes in his first start. He had his sinker, changeup and slider all working well.	"If I can limit `em to singles and allow the defense to do some work behind me, that's going to be big for me," Gibson said.	Gibson, who failed to finish the fourth at Detroit last week, improved to 4-0 in four career starts with a 1.38 ERA against Kansas City.	"He's always pitched well against us. Tonight he was on," Royals manager Ned Yost said.	The Royals (7-1) were chasing the 2003 team's 9-0 start as the best in franchise history, but Gibson (1-1) used 12 groundball outs and three strikeouts to keep the highest-scoring team in the majors quiet for a night.	Edinson Volquez (1-1) struck out seven in 7 2/3 innings, with five hits and one walk allowed. He loaded the bases with no outs in the first, but he escaped with only Brian Dozier's sacrifice fly as the damage after a long running catch by Cain.	Arcia's two-strike, two-out drive into the seats above right-center field in the fourth came right after Trevor Plouffe's single. Arcia said he knew it was gone.	"That would be the one pitch he'd wish he could bring back, but outside of that he threw a great game," Yost said.	LINEUP SWITCH	Molitor moved Torii Hunter to the second spot and dropped Dozier into the cleanup spot for the first time in his career. In 395 career major league games, Dozier has now appeared in every spot in the batting order.	UPSET RIOS	Rios, who broke the pinky finger on his left hand when he was hit by a pitch from Twins rookie J.R. Graham the night before, was upset about the circumstance.	"It's frustrating when you get inexperienced pitchers coming to the mound showing a lot of energy and not being able to control their emotions," Rios said. "I think that's a recipe for disaster."	Graham, a Rule 5 draft acquisition from Atlanta, must stay on the 25-man roster all season for the Twins to keep him. The Twins expressed their condolences to Rios.	"It's just a young kid getting out there trying to do maybe a little bit too much," Molitor said. "But you hate to see anybody get hurt."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals: Rios said he wasn't surprised by the diagnosis, considering how hard the pitch was and the placement of his hand against the knob of the bat. He passed a strength test on his hand, one encouraging sign for a recovery that could take about a month.	Twins: Right-hander Ricky Nolasco, seven days into his stint on the 15-day disabled list, was cleared for some long toss to test his inflamed elbow. "So far so good," general manager Terry Ryan said.	UP NEXT	The Royals will send left-hander Jason Vargas to the mound for the series finale on Thursday afternoon to face Twins left-hander Tommy Milone.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

HOUSTON --  Houston Astros starter Collin McHugh pumped his fists and cheered as he walked off the field.	It didn't matter that it was just the end of the first inning of a game in April. McHugh had just struck out the side against one of baseball's hottest offenses. He wasn't ready to let his team be swept in the three-game series.	"It's a big game," McHugh said. "I was pumped up. I was excited."	McHugh struck out 11, and Jed Lowrie hit one of the Astros' three homers in a 6-1 win over the Oakland Athletics on Wednesday night.	Luis Valbuena and Evan Gattis also homered for the Astros, who matched their season high in scoring.	Houston's bats are finally starting to show signs of life after being held to two runs or less in six of their first eight games.	The A's have been outscored 32-14 in their five losses, compared to a 42-1 margin in their five wins.	"We've had a couple of games where we haven't scored and given up some runs," A's manager Bob Melvin said. "But overall, I still think we have some quality."	McHugh (2-0) allowed six hits and one run in 5 2/3 innings. McHugh is the only Astros starter to earn a win since Dallas Keuchel's opening-day victory. McHugh extended his winning streak to nine, the longest for an Astros pitcher since Roy Oswalt in 2006-2007.	McHugh was relieved by Tony Sipp with two outs in the sixth after Ike Davis doubled.	Oakland starter Drew Pomeranz (1-1) followed his masterful two-hit, seven-inning performance against Seattle by allowing four runs and six hits in five innings.	"It's pretty frustrating," Pomeranz said. "They got hits at the right time, and they took advantage of them."	The Astros hit Pomeranz hard early, with Jose Altuve leading off with a 400-foot double to left-center, and Lowrie following with a two-run homer off the train tracks above the left-field fence.	"He really didn't pitch bad," Melvin said. "We just didn't score any runs for him."	Oakland picked up a run in the second inning when Marcus Semien beat out a close play for an infield single with the bases loaded. Semien's hit was the fourth Oakland single in the inning, scoring Billy Butler.	Lowrie had an RBI double in the third inning, and Altuve added a run-scoring single in the fifth to make it 4-1.	Facing the team he spent the past two seasons with, Lowrie was hit by a pitch on Tuesday and joked with players and coaches before Wednesday's game about potential retaliation.	"It was all in jest," Lowrie said before admitting that beating his former team feels extra special. "When you know most of the guys over there, you want to beat them. I know all those guys feel the same way."	Valbuena gave Houston a 5-1 lead with a homer into the first row of the Crawford Boxes in left field.	Gattis' 421-foot homer to deep left-center in the eighth inning was his first as an Astro and was just his third hit in 33 at-bats this season. The homer boosted his average to .094.	"It was pretty exciting when he got back to the dugout," Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. "Everyone in that clubhouse knows how much he's grinding to try to break out. So maybe this is a sign of things to come. He certainly takes every at-bat as if it's his last at-bat."	Butler extended his hitting streak to an American League-leading 10 games. Butler became the first player in club history to get a hit in his first 10 games as an Athletic. On Friday, Butler returns to Kansas City, where he spent the first eight years of his career.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: IF-OF Ben Zobrist was held from the starting lineup Wednesday with a bruised right heel. Oakland manager Bob Melvin said Zobrist felt lingering soreness from a defensive play earlier in the week. Melvin said Zobrist was available to play and expected him to return to the starting lineup on Friday in Kansas City. ... LHP closer Sean Doolittle is making progress in his rehab throwing program, Melvin said. Doolittle played long toss from 105 to 120 feet on Tuesday with no pain. Doolittle (slight rotator cuff tear in his left shoulder) is expected to miss the first month of the season.	Astros: Houston reliever Josh Fields (groin) made his third rehab appearance Tuesday night for Triple-A Fresno, tossing one scoreless inning with one strikeout. Astros manager A.J. Hinch said Fields will throw at least one more game on his rehab assignment before returning to the Astros.	UP NEXT	Athletics: Right-hander Sonny Gray (1-0) will start for Oakland on Friday. Gray has allowed just one earned run in 15 1/3 innings in his first two starts and is 5-1 with a 1.61 ERA in seven career starts in April.	Astros: Right-hander Roberto Hernandez (0-1) will take the mound against the Los Angeles Angels. The 34-year-old gave up five runs, one earned, on five hits and four walks in 4 2/3 innings in his Astros debut at Texas.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ST. LOUIS --  St. Louis' Lance Lynn wasn't at his best on Wednesday night. Even a less-than-stellar effort couldn't put a halt to his April success.	The right-hander pitched five solid innings and he received help from six relievers to lead the Cardinals to a 4-2 win over the Milwaukee Brewers.	Lynn (1-1) allowed one run and six hits. He pushed his April record to 13-2 since 2012, the best record in the majors over that period.	"I wasn't sharp, I had a lot of deep counts," Lynn said. "It was just one of those games. When you don't have your best command and you get out of there giving up just one run, that helps."	Wily Peralta (0-1) gave up four runs on 10 hits over five innings for Milwaukee.	Brewers center fielder Carlos Gomez was removed from the game in the ninth inning. He was limping after beating out a play at first base. Milwaukee manager Ron Roenicke said Gomez strained a hamstring and it requires further tests. He indicated that Gomez will not be in the lineup for the series finale on Thursday.	Yadier Molina had three hits for St. Louis, which won 12 of 19 against Brewers last season.	Kevin Siegrist, Seth Maness, Matt Belisle, Randy Choate, Jordan Walden and Trevor Rosenthal followed Lynn. Rosenthal picked up his third save despite giving up a two-out run-scoring hit to Ryan Braun in the ninth. He got Adam Lind to fly out to end the game.	"That's not how we draw it up, to use so many guys that much," St. Louis manager Mike Matheny said. "But wins are that valuable. You've got to jump on them when you can."	The six relievers combined to allow just one run on four hits over the final four innings.	"They did the job, they bailed me out," Lynn said.	Lynn worked out of trouble in four of his five innings and threw 99 pitches. He rebounded to set the side down in order on 16 pitches in the fifth.	"It wasn't one of his better days and he was still good," Matheny said. "He went deep in a lot of counts, but he left a lot of guys on base."	Roenicke said his club simply couldn't bunch enough hits together at the right time.	"I thought we did a pretty good job putting people on base," he said. "We had some chances. We're just not stringing together a lot of hits."	The Cardinals needed just six pitches to take a 2-0 lead.

SAN DIEGO --  A year ago, a game like this seemed destined to go extra innings.	Not so with this San Diego Padres lineup.	Justin Upton homered with two outs in the eighth inning to give the Padres a 3-2 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Wednesday night.	Upton, one of several star players obtained in an offseason roster revamp, hit the first pitch he saw from Randall Delgado (0-1) into the seats in left. It was his third. Upton also homered in a 5-1 win Tuesday night.	"You always feel as though you're always one swing away no matter who goes to the plate," manager Bud Black said. "There might be a little difference when you have some guys with true raw power. We have some guys with true raw power. One mistake and one good swing can result in what happened tonight."	Craig Kimbrel pitched the ninth for his third save in as many chances since joining the Padres the day before the season opener.	"I think as a team if we can hand the ball to Craig with the lead, we've got a good chance of winning," said Upton, who hit his third homer with the Padres. "To get that quick strike, I think that fires up the team and fires up the crowd and gets one of our best players in the game to close it out.	"It's part of my game," said Upton, who always hit well at Petco as a visitor with the Diamondbacks and then the Atlanta Braves. "I've got to use it. I don't go out there trying to hit home runs but when it does come out, it's a part of my game that I hope shows up more times than not."	Upton said he sees the ball well at Petco against the dark blue backdrop in center field. "You've got to stay within yourself here. You can't let the big dimensions make you swing hard or get big," he said.	"We wanted to go fastball away. We didn't want him to pull the ball but it got too much of the plate," catcher Jordan Pacheco said.	"There's runs here, and there's homers here," Black said.	The Padres added stars Upton, Matt Kemp, Wil Myers and Will Middlebrooks to pump up the worst offense in the majors.	"That's why they got him here. He's a good hitter," Arizona manager Chip Hale said about Upton. "We made a bad pitch and that's what happens. He pitched very well before that.  He's pitched well all season for us and made one bad pitch and that's what superstar players do. He did it to us."	Joaquin Benoit (3-0) pitched the eighth for the win.	Yasmany Tomas, Arizona's heralded 24-year-old Cuban prospect, made his big league debut as a pinch-hitter in the seventh and grounded out to second to end the inning.	"By that time I had my good slider and I think I threw a cutter and a couple of sliders and just threw good pitches to him," Morrow said.	Paul Goldschmidt gave the Diamondbacks a 2-0 lead with his opposite-field home run to right off Brandon Morrow with one out in the first off second. It was third homer of the season and his 500th career hit. Ender Inciarte was aboard on a leadoff single.	San Diego came back on Yonder Alonso's RBI double in the second and Matt Kemp's sacrifice fly in the sixth.	Arizona center fielder A.J. Pollock threw out Derek Norris trying to score from second on Will Middlebrooks' single to end the sixth.	Morrow allowed two runs and seven hits in seven innings, struck out five and walked one.	Arizona starter Chase Anderson allowed two runs and eight hits in six innings, struck out five and walked one.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: RHP Ian Kennedy, on the 15-day disabled list with a strained left hamstring, threw a bullpen session. He's scheduled to throw another one Friday in Chicago and then likely make a rehab start.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: After a dazzling big league debut in which he beat Clayton Kershaw, the reigning NY MVP and Cy Young Award winner, Arizona right-hander Archie Bradley (1-0, 0.00) gets a shot at World Series MVP Madison Bumgarner (1-1, 5.40) and the Giants in San Francisco.	Padres: San Diego is off Thursday before opening a three-game series at the Chicago Cubs on Friday, when ace James Shields (1-0, 2.08) is scheduled to make his third start. Chicago is scheduled to start RHP Jason Hammel (1-0, 4.50).	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

LOS ANGELES --  Joc Pederson used his bat, glove and arm to help Brett Anderson record his first victory with the Los Angeles Dodgers.	Pederson continues to turn heads with every game he plays during his first full season in the big leagues. He singled home a run, made a diving catch to rob Mike Zunino of a hit and threw him out at the plate Wednesday night in a 5-2 win that completed the Dodgers' three-game sweep of the Seattle Mariners.	It was measure of payback for Pederson, who was thrown out trying to steal second base by the Mariners' catcher on consecutive nights.	"He threw me out yesterday and he got me again today, so I'm glad I could return the favor," Pederson said. "Defense is huge, and it wins ballgames. To be able to take one away from someone is always nice to do. It brings some momentum to the team and it gives the pitcher some more confidence to make his pitch -- knowing their teammates are back there doing what they can to make a play for them."	Scott Van Slyke had a two-run double in support of Anderson (1-0). The left-hander allowed two runs -- one earned -- and six hits over five innings and struck out three in the annual Civil Rights Game, which included a pregame ceremony celebrating the 68th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's major league debut.	One of Seattle's runs came on a homer by red-hot Nelson Cruz, who has gone deep in a career-best five consecutive games.	"I don't think any park is pitcher-friendly to Nelson Cruz at this point," Anderson said. "But I was able to keep the ball on the ground better and get some groundballs and some soft line drives. I've given the team a chance to win two times in a row, so I'll take that at this point. It was a pretty special day to be a part of."	Taijuan Walker (0-1) gave up five runs, six hits and four walks in four innings. Last Friday at Oakland, the right-hander surrendered nine runs and nine hits through 3 1/3 innings in his first start of the season.	"His velocity was fine. He's just got to control the strike zone a little better," manager Lloyd McClendon said. "We've got to get better efforts from our starters. We've got to get deeper into ballgames. We've got a real good bullpen, but they won't be worth a darn if we keep running them out there."	The Dodgers, coming off back-to-back walkoff victories against Seattle in the first interleague series of the season for both clubs, did all of their scoring in the first three innings. They grabbed a 3-0 lead in the first on a two-out RBI single by Andre Ethier and Van Slyke's double to left field.	Adrian Gonzalez hit an RBI single off the glove of first baseman Logan Morrison in the second, and Pederson singled home a run in the third. Gonzalez added a double in the sixth for his 19th hit in the team's first nine games.	The Mariners got on the board in the fourth when Cruz homered to right-center. They got another run in the sixth on an RBI groundout by Kyle Seager with the bases loaded, and were threatening for more when Robinson Cano ran himself into a costly out.	Paco Rodriguez had just walked Morrison when Cano inexplicably kept creeping down the third-base line, trying to catch catcher Yasmani Grandal napping. But Rodriguez frantically motioned and yelled to his batterymate, who reacted quickly and ran Cano back to third before Juan Uribe tagged him for the second out.	"Robby just thought the bases were loaded," McClendon said. "Tonight, we got in the way of our talents, there's no question about that."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: Felix Hernandez, whose second start of the season on Sunday at Oakland ended after five innings because of tightness in his right quadriceps, threw a side session Wednesday on flat ground and did not experience any setbacks. So, the 2010 AL Cy Young Award winner is a go to start on Saturday against Texas at Safeco Field.	Dodgers: RF Yasiel Puig sat out his second straight game due to tightness in his left hamstring. ... LF Carl Crawford didn't start because of an injured left foot, which occurred Tuesday night when he scrambled back to second base after making a wide turn on a single. He pinch-hit in the seventh and struck out.	UP NEXT	Mariners: LHP J.A. Happ (0-0) will start against the Texas Rangers on Friday night against RHP Yovani Gallardo in the opener of a nine-game homestand.	Dodgers: Clayton Kershaw (0-1) will start the opener of a three-game set against Colorado at Chavez Ravine on Friday against RHP Kyle Kendrick.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN FRANCISCO --  As if this week couldn't get much better for Colorado's Nolan Arenado, he now gets to head home to Orange County and spend his 24th birthday Thursday eating some home cooking by his mother, Millie.	The menu?	"I don't know what she's going to make me. Hopefully it's something I like," Arenado said with a smile.	He has earned it, making the catch of his career one night and hitting a three-run homer the next to lead the first-place Rockies past the San Francisco Giants 4-2 on Wednesday for a three-game sweep.	"It's been cool," Arenado said. "The main thing about these days is that we've been winning. These days aren't fun if we don't win. That play I made yesterday, if we don't win, it's not as good as it was, and the home run today."	Tyler Matzek (1-0) outpitched two-time NL Cy Young Award winner Tim Lincecum, retiring 12 of 13 batters during one stretch. The NL West-leading Rockies extended the best road start in franchise history to 6-0 while sending the reigning World Series champions to a sixth straight defeat.	Charlie Blackmon added a sacrifice fly for the Rockies, who at 7-2 have matched the best nine-game start in franchise history by joining the 1995, '97 and 2011 clubs.	Matt Duffy hit his first career home run with a solo drive in the eighth off Boone Logan for the Giants. Angel Pagan added an RBI single in the first.	The Rockies won at AT&T Park for the ninth time in 13 games, including a three-game sweep from June 13-15 last year.	Matzek took a little while to find his fastball, then allowed five hits and one run in six innings, struck out two and walked one while earning just his third road victory (3-7) in 12 starts. Just-promoted closer Adam Ottavino finished for the second straight night to get his third career save. He struck out two more in a perfect ninth after striking out the side in order in the ninth Tuesday.	Colorado won eight road games last April, then just 13 the rest of the way. That has been a point of emphasis for manager Walt Weiss' club.	"If we keep throwing the ball well and stay healthy, there's no reason we can't play like this the whole season," Matzek said.	Lincecum left a slider a little up on Arenado's two-out drive in the first to dig himself an early hole the Giants couldn't get out of with their struggling offense.	A night earlier, Arenado made a spectacular falling catch over the tarp and rail in foul territory along the left-field line on Gregor Blanco's popup. He immediately threw from his knees while still on the tarp and nearly got Angel Pagan at third for a double play. Arenado still had some lingering soreness Wednesday.	"He's their guy. He's a nice player and maybe the best defensive third baseman in the game," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "I haven't seen a better one. And he hits in the heart of their order."	Matzek hit Giants leadoff hitter Nori Aoki in the back with his fourth pitch of the game. He then stole his third base before advancing to third on backup catcher Michael McKenry, giving Nick Hundley a breather.	Pagan singled home Aoki moments later.	Aoki went 0 for 3 and had his career-best 17-game hitting streak snapped that dated to Sept. 21 last year.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rockies: LHP Jorge De La Rosa will make his season debut for Colorado on Monday at Coors Field against San Diego. He made his second rehab appearance Tuesday night for Triple-A Albuquerque while nursing a strained left groin.	Giants: SS Brandon Crawford got a much-needed rest day while mired in an 0-for-21 funk. ... X-rays on the fractured left forearm of Hunter Pence "were fine" according to manager Bruce Bochy and the RF could pick up a bat in about a week, though there isn't a timetable. ... 3B Casey McGehee could make his home debut after missing four starts with a bone bruise in his left knee.	UP NEXT	Rockies: After an off day Thursday in Los Angeles, RHP Kyle Kendrick (1-1) -- Colorado's opening day starter -- will make his second road start among his first three outings in the series opener Friday at Dodger Stadium opposite reigning NL MVP and Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw.	Giants: Bochy will celebrate his 60th birthday Thursday in the opener of a four-game series against Arizona. World Series MVP Madison Bumgarner (1-1) looks to bounce back after being knocked out of the game after just three innings with 10 hits and five runs Saturday at San Diego.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MINNEAPOLIS --  The Minnesota Twins were a little frustrated after their first seven games, having played about as poorly as possible.	Hitting the ball over the wall was a good way to bounce back.	Kennys Vargas and Kurt Suzuki each hit a two-run homer Thursday, powering the Twins past the Kansas City Royals 8-5 for their first series win this season.	"We have some guys that can hit the ball over the fence," manager Paul Molitor said. "We all know Target Field can be a challenge in that regard compared to some of the other parks, but we want to have a mixture: guys that hit for average, guys that can run the bases and we always welcome hitting them over the fence."	Lorenzo Cain put the Royals in front with his two-run shot in the first inning, but starter Jason Vargas (1-1) was shelled. He gave up 10 hits and a walk, failing to get an out in the fourth and leaving with a 5-3 deficit.	Minnesota's Vargas sure had his Kansas City foe, no relation, figured out. The burly switch-hitter hit a line drive in the second off the ribbon scoreboard that serves as the facade of the second deck above left field to tie the game.	"You have to tip your cap. You miss inside, and he's still able turn on it and keep it fair," Jason Vargas said. "After that they were just able to bleed us out."	With Oswaldo Arcia's two-run home run Wednesday, the Twins went deep three times in two days after hitting only two homers in their first seven games. They're still last in the American League, but the productive swings by Vargas were a good sign.	In the third inning, two batters after a groundout gave Joe Mauer the first of his three RBIs, Kennys Vargas crushed a full-count changeup to the left-center gap that Cain grabbed with a smooth lunging catch to limit the damage.	Vargas has 10 career home runs, but this was only his second as a right-hander. That's his natural side, but he has so far displayed more power hitting left. Vargas played first base Thursday for the first time this season.	"It's a little bit different, but it's my job," Vargas said.	Tommy Milone (2-0) did his job, despite the rough start, by logging 5 1/3 innings and keeping the lead.	Cain went 3 for 4 with three runs and three RBIs and Mike Moustakas and Salvador Perez each had two hits for the Royals, but Milone minimized their threats.	He allowed seven hits and three walks before ceding to five relievers. Brian Duensing gave up two runs in a rocky start to the ninth, but Glen Perkins got the last two outs for his second save.	The season-high 14 hits sure came in handy. Five Twins had two or more hits, including Torii Hunter who went 3 for 5. The Twins even spoiled the perfect run by the Royals bullpen, after 23 1/3 scoreless innings to start the season.	"The guys had my back today, especially scoring right after they scored in the first inning. You kind of get that breath of fresh air to go back out there," Milone said.	CAIN DO	Cain has two homers this year, after going deep only 17 times in 358 major league games entering the season. With his speed, brilliant defense and batting average that's up to .429, the MVP of the American League championship series has fast become one of Kansas City's most indispensable players.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals: Christian Colon gave Omar Infante his first break at second base, but Perez remained in the lineup at catcher for the ninth straight time despite the afternoon start following the night game. Manager Ned Yost said he wanted Perez's hitting potential on a day with Alex Gordon resting and Alex Rios out indefinitely. Yost said Perez could get a day off this weekend.	Twins: Casey Fien has showed no lingering effects of the shoulder stiffness that limited him to one inning over the first seven games. After pitching a perfect eighth Wednesday, the right-hander was sharp again with a four-up, four-down performance with a tidy 13 pitches.	UP NEXT	The Royals will return home for a three-game series against Oakland starting Friday. Left-hander Jeremy Guthrie is scheduled to pitch for the Royals, after winning his season debut while completing seven innings on the road against the Los Angeles Angels. Right-hander Sonny Gray will start for the Athletics.	The Twins will host Cleveland for a three-game series beginning Friday, when AL Cy Young Award winner Corey Kluber pitches for the Indians and Mike Pelfrey takes the mound for the Twins. Pelfrey's last start at Target Field was nearly a year ago, on May 1.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

WASHINGTON --  Michael A. Taylor rebounded from his latest outfield mishap with a big home run for the Washington Nationals.	Doug Fister pitched effectively into the seventh inning, Yunel Escobar also homered and the Nationals beat the Philadelphia Phillies 5-2 Thursday night.	Taylor's error in center field helped the Phillies take the lead before his homer in the fifth put Washington ahead 3-2.	"It's nice to get that hit," Taylor said. "Didn't make me feel any better."	On Monday in Boston, Taylor had two balls drop near him for hits.	Thursday, Carlos Ruiz's drive hit off his glove for a two-base error and Taylor got some advice from coach Tony Tarasco.	"He said `don't drop the ball," the 24-year-old Taylor said, smiling. "It's great coaching,"	Ryan Zimmerman added a two-run double for Washington which, after averaging 2.4 runs through its first seven games, has 22 runs and 28 hits over its last three.	Fister (1-0) allowed two runs on four hits in 6 2/3 innings, striking out four and walking four.	"I think he got a little tired in the last inning," manager Matt Williams said. "Other than that he was good, in command the whole game."	Drew Storen pitched the ninth for his third save.	Cole Hamels (0-2) gave up five runs and five hits in six innings. He walked four and struck out seven. The left-hander had allowed three earned runs or fewer in each of his last 15 starts against Washington.	He's already allowed seven home runs after allowing 14 all of 2014.	"It seems like when he's elevated, the hitters haven't missed it up to this point," Sandberg said.	With his team having lost four straight and averaging just 2.4 runs per game this year, Phillies manager Ryne Sandberg tinkered with his lineup, moving struggling first baseman Ryan Howard from fourth to seventh.	It was Howard's first time batting seventh April 2006. He went 1 for 3 with an intentional walk. Jeff Francouer slipped into the fourth spot and went 1 for 3 with a walk.	"Do I feel I can hit fourth? Yeah, I know I can," Howard said.	Taylor's drop helped the Phillies take a 2-1 lead, but an inning later he got the run back, hitting Hamels' 2-0 pitch into the Phillies' bullpen, giving Washington a 3-2 lead.	Zimmerman's double made it 5-2 in the sixth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: OF Domonic Brown (left achilles tendinitis) is expected to join Triple-A Lehigh Valley on Friday as he continues a rehab assignment. He went 4 for 14 with a homer in five games with Class A Clearwater.	Nationals: Williams said RHP Craig Stammen, who went on the DL with right forearm stiffness Wednesday, will need surgery to repair a torn flexor. ... OF Denard Span (right core muscle surgery) played seven innings for Class A Hagerstown Thursday night in his second rehab game, going 3 for 4 with a homer and two RBIs. He'll start again at Hagerstown on Friday night.	HEARING HARPER'S FOOTSTEPS	When Werth scored from second on Zimmerman's double, he was nearly caught by Harper from first. "I had to go back with nobody out and tag." Werth said. "I came around third and (third base coach Bob) Henley put the stop sign up, so when I crossed home plate I was surprised to see Bryce right behind me. You know, run `til they tag you."	HAMELS BALKING INTO TROUBLE	Washington's scored a run after Hamels balked Harper to second and Wilson Ramos hit an RBI single. It was Hamels second balk this season. He six career balks coming in. "I guess my foot crossed. I just don't understand where the actual crossline is. I guess I'll have to look that up," he said. ".twice in one year, and I normally don't ever balk."	UP NEXT	Nationals free-agent acquisition Max Scherzer (0-1, 0.66) makes his third start in a rematch of Sunday's starters. The right hander has allowed four runs, one earned, on 10 hits over 13 2/3 innings. Philadelphia's Sean O'Sullivan (0-0, 3.00 ERA) makes his first career start at Nationals Park.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

TORONTO --  In the finale of their first series of the season, the Rays and Blue Jays set the stage for retaliation when they meet in Florida in eight days.	Chris Archer struck out 11 in seven shutout innings, pinch-hitter Tim Beckham hit a two-run homer in the sixth and the Rays beat the Blue Jays 4-2 on Thursday night in a game that saw three batters hit by pitches.	Evan Longoria left in the eighth after he was hit on the left hip by a pitch from Marco Estrada, one inning after Archer drilled Toronto slugger Edwin Encarnacion on the left elbow.	"I think there was some intent there," Rays manager Kevin Cash said of the pitch that hit Longoria.	The Rays and Blue Jays still have 15 games against one another, starting with a three-game series that opens April 24 at Tropicana Field.	"It should make for an interesting rest of the year against these guys," Longoria said.	Even though he felt he was drilled intentionally, Longoria said he wasn't angry at Estrada, his former college teammate at Long Beach State.	"We have a history of friendship," Longoria said. "I don't have any hard feelings toward him."	Cash said Longoria was day-to-day. The Rays return home Friday to begin a three-game series against the Yankees.	"He got dinged pretty good, but we've got a flight to factor in, just sitting and getting up in the air and stuff," Cash said. "We'll evaluate it tomorrow."	After Mikie Mahtook came on to pinch run for Longoria, an animated Archer leaned against the top railing of the Rays' first base dugout, yelling and gesturing at Toronto's bench. Home plate umpire Laz Diaz eventually removed his mask and walked toward Archer, telling him to calm down. Archer also hit Toronto catcher Russell Martin in the second.	"I could care less what that guy does," Toronto's Josh Donaldson said of Archer's antics. "He's on the other team. I'm more focused on my team."	In the bottom of the eighth, Rays reliever Steve Geltz hit Donaldson on the left hand. Cash asked for a review, then was ejected when the call was upheld. It was the first ejection for Cash, who argued with Diaz before leaving.	"I was shocked that it wasn't overturned," Cash said.	Beckham's pinch-hit homer was his second of the season, making him the first rookie in Tampa Bay history with two pinch-hit long balls -- and the first Rays player since Willy Aybar in 2010 to hit two in a season.	Before this season, the only Rays rookies with pinch-hit home runs were Bubba Trammell in 1998 and Jonny Gomes in 2005.	Archer (2-1) allowed just two hits and two walks, lowering his ERA to 1.37.	Steve Geltz and Kevin Jepsen worked the eighth and Brad Boxberger finished for his fourth save.	The Rays took three of four from Toronto and went 5-2 on their first road trip of the season.	Tampa Bay opened the scoring on a fielder's choice by Steven Souza in the third, and went ahead 2-0 on an RBI double by David DeJesus in the fifth.	Tampa Bay chased Toronto starter Aaron Sanchez in the sixth, which began with a double by Longoria. It was the 230th double of Longoria's career, moving him past Ben Zobrist into first place on the Rays' all-time list.	One out later, left-hander Aaron Loup came on for Sanchez, and Beckham replaced Allan Dykstra. Beckham fell behind 0-2 before hooking a home run around the left field foul screen.	Sanchez (0-2) allowed three runs and five hits in 5 1/3 innings. He walked three and struck out four.	Blue Jays shortstop Jose Reyes left after one at-bat with soreness in his left ribs. Reyes grimaced and held his side after grounding out in the first inning. Once back in the dugout, he slammed his batting helmet to the ground and disappeared up the tunnel to the clubhouse. He was replaced by Ryan Goins, who was recalled from Triple-A Buffalo earlier Thursday.	"I'm going to take some days off and see, with some rest, if it calms down a little bit," Reyes said.	MINOR MOVE	The Rays signed C/1B J.P. Arencibia to a minor league contract and assigned him to Triple-A Durham. Arencibia, who was recently released by Baltimore, had 23 homers and 78 RBIs for the Blue Jays in 2011. Cash said Arencibia will primarily play first for Durham.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: LH Jake McGee (elbow surgery) threw one inning in an extended spring training game. ... RH Alex Colome (pneumonia) allowed two runs and six hits in three innings in his second rehab start at Class-A Charlotte. He walked none and struck out four.	Blue Jays: DeJesus slid hard into 2B Devon Travis' left leg while breaking up a double play in the third. The trainer came out to check on Travis, who remained in the game.	UP NEXT	Rays: Tampa Bay returns home Friday to begin a three-game series against the Yankees. RHP Nathan Karns (1-1) faces RHP Adam Warren (0-1) in the opener.	Blue Jays: Toronto hosts Atlanta in the opener of the three-game series Friday. Braves RHP Julio Teheran (2-0) faces Blue Jays RHP Drew Hutchison (1-0). Hutchison lost his only career start against the Braves, while Teheran took a no-decision in his lone career start against Toronto.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

NEW YORK -- To a man, Lucas Duda and Michael Cuddyer and the rest of the New York Mets quickly point out they've played just 10 games in April. Still, for a team with tremendous expectations after a long run of losing, they're off to a fast start.	"It's real early," manager Terry Collins said, "but I like it a lot."	Duda got three more hits and the Mets overcame Giancarlo Stanton's blast and Ichiro Suzuki's ballet to beat the Miami Marlins 7-5 Thursday night for their fifth straight win.	The Mets lost a replay challenge that took nearly six minutes, but wound up posting their longest winning streak since May 2013.	"A year ago, we don't win tonight," Collins said.	Coming off six straight losing seasons, Collins didn't take the bait when it was mentioned that at 7-3, the Mets led the NL East. That will mean something, Collins said, only in October.	Wilmer Flores hit a three-run homer that helped the Mets rally from an early 3-0 deficit. Duda doubled twice and lined a tiebreaking single in the seventh inning, lifting the slugger's batting average to .395.	Duda has gotten a pair of extra-base hits in three straight games. The last Mets player to do it was Carlos Beltran in 2006.	"Overall, great job, team win," Duda said.	Stanton hit his first home run since a fastball to the face ended his season last September. It was his 155th career homer, moving him past Dan Uggla for most in Marlins' history.	"I'll enjoy it later," Stanton said. Referring to the Marlins' mark this season, he added "3-7 is the only record I know right now."	Suzuki made a pair of headfirst dives home on the same play, eluding catcher Travis d'Arnaud to make it 5-all in the seventh. On third after a pinch-hit triple, he took off on an infield grounder.	D'Arnaud caught a wide throw, and both he and Suzuki made a dive for the plate. Suzuki missed the plate by an inch and d'Arnaud missed him. Still spry at 41, Suzuki lunged with his hand and beat the tag by a split-second.	Originally called out, Suzuki was ruled safe after a replay review that took 5 minutes, 44 seconds.	Jerry Blevins (1-0) got the win and Jeurys Familia closed for his fourth save. Mike Dunn (0-1) took the loss.	It was 5-all when pinch hitter John Mayberry Jr. walked and stole second with one out in the Mets seventh. Duda's two-out liner fell just beyond the dive of left fielder Christian Yelich, and Cuddyer followed with his second RBI single.	Stanton launched a long, two-out drive in the first. He led the NL with 37 home runs despite a season-ending beaning on Sept. 11. Martin Prado homered for a 3-0 in the fourth.	The Mets made two key defensive plays in the sixth. D'Arnaud caught speedy Dee Gordon trying to steal second and right fielder Curtis Granderson banged into the wall after a running catch on J.T. Realmuto's bases-loaded drive with two outs.	Collins also made his first replay challenge this season and won, with Realmuto losing an infield hit in the fifth.	ADD `EM UP	Mets starter Dillon Gee struck out seven in 5 2/3 innings. He's pitched at least five innings in 48 straight starts, the longest active streak in the majors and two short of the team record held by Dwight Gooden.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: Yelich returned to the lineup after missing two games because of back tightness. ... RHP Henderson Alvarez (inflammation in shoulder and elbow) is expected to begin playing catch in the next few days. ... OF Don Kelly and C Jeff Mathis, both out with fractures, have been hand specialists and won't need surgery.	Mets: 3B David Wright (strained right hamstring) hopes to be able to start physical activities Friday. He got a cortisone shot Wednesday, a day after getting hurt.	UP NEXT	Marlins: RHP David Phelps makes his first start for Miami, facing the Mets on Friday night. He came off the paternity list and rejoined the team Thursday. Acquired from the Yankees in an offseason trade, he's pitched twice in relief.	Mets: RHP Bartolo Colon (2-0) starts Friday. He is 3-2 lifetime vs. the Marlins, and pitched a complete game the first time he faced them -- in 2002, for the Montreal Expos against Florida.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Arizona second baseman Aaron Hill spent most of the game diving around on the infield dirt at AT&T Park. He ended it with a rare hit off Giants closer Sergio Romo that likely saved teammate Josh Collmenter's spot in the Diamondbacks' rotation.	Hill hit a two-run double with two outs in the 12th inning and Arizona held on to beat San Francisco Giants 7-6 on Thursday night.	Diamondbacks manager Chip Hale had cleared his bench, emptied his bullpen and had Collmenter -- Friday's scheduled starter -- warming up in the bullpen.	Hale planned on using Collmenter had the game gone any longer. Hill, who made several key defensive plays earlier in the game, bailed the Arizona skipper out with his game-winning hit -- Hill's first in 11 at-bats against Romo.	"He's pitched me very well," Hill said. "I've always told myself just try to get something up with him. He's got that tough slider. I was lucky enough to get something I could put a barrel on."	Ender Inciarte singled to lead off the inning against Sergio Romo (0-1) and stole second base. After Paul Goldschmidt was intentionally walked with one out, Cliff Pennington popped out to short. Hill followed with a line shot into the gap in left-center to drive in both runners.	Randall Delgado (1-1), the eighth Arizona pitcher, retired six batters for the win.	Mark Trumbo, Paul Goldschmidt and A.J. Pollock homered for the Diamondbacks, who blew a three-run lead late before beating San Francisco for only the fourth time in the last 15 games.	"We have to learn how to win these type of games," Hale said. "When you win in 12 it's great but you'd like to win that game in nine."	Brandon Crawford homered to end an 0-for-23 slump for the Giants. San Francisco has lost seven straight.	The 3-8 start matches the Giants' worst start in the San Francisco era.	"We're not happy about it, that's for sure," Giants starter Madison Bumgarner said. "But I definitely think things will turn around for us. It can be frustrating but we play a lot of games."	Arizona won despite blowing two late leads.	Joe Panik's two-out triple in the ninth tied the score at 4-all.	After Pollock hit a home run in the 10th that bounced off the foul pole in left field, San Francisco rallied to tie it again on Matt Duffy's infield single with the bases loaded in the bottom of the inning.	Hill's hit put the Diamondbacks back in front but Delgado gave up a two-out RBI double to Duffy before Panik lined out to the pitcher to end it.	Trumbo homered leading off the second while Goldschmidt hit a three-run home run in the fifth. Both home runs came off Bumgarner, the reigning World Series MVP.	Bumgarner allowed six hits in seven innings with four strikeouts and one walk.	It wasn't enough to prevent the defending champs from extending their longest losing streak since 2010, on manager Bruce Bochy's 60th birthday at that.	Diamondbacks starter Archie Bradley, who beat 2014 NL CY Young winner Clayton Kershaw in his first major league start on April 11, gave up two runs and four hits in 6 2/3 innings. He struck out four and walked two.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: LHP Patrick Corbin and RHP David Hernandez will throw bullpen sessions on Friday. Both are coming back from elbow surgery and have been on the disabled list since the beginning of the season.	Giants: Injured 3B Casey McGehee (knee) took grounders and did some running before the game but was not in the starting lineup. McGhee, who pinch-hit with two outs in the ninth, expects to start Friday.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: RHP Collmenter (0-2) looks to snap his winless streak against San Francisco, the team he beat to earn his first major league victory in 2011.	Giants: RHP Jake Peavy (0-1) starts against Arizona and has beaten the Diamondbacks in his last appearances against them since 2009.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DETROIT --  Coming into this season, the Tigers had started 9-1 just twice since World War I: in 1968 and 1984, the years of Detroit's last two World Series titles.	Detroit has won nine of its first 10 games once again following Friday's 2-1 victory over the Chicago White Sox, which ended on Jose Iglesias' ninth-inning single.	"I don't put a lot of stock in yesterday, but they also can't take these wins away from us," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.	Detroit's rally was aided by a controversial call White Sox manager Robin Ventura didn't challenge because he made his decision too late.	Nick Castellanos led off the ninth with a sinking liner to right off Zach Duke (1-1) that Melky Cabrera couldn't grab cleanly. Castellanos stretched the hit into a double, and while replays appeared to show shortstop Alexei Ramirez tagging him on a toe, second-base umpire Brian O'Nora ruled called the runner safe.	"It was a bang-bang play, and I couldn't really feel if he touched me or not," Castellanos said. "A lot of umpires, if the ball beats you there, they take it for granted and call you out. I was happy that didn't happen."	Ramirez signaled to the Chicago dugout, and Ventura came out to discuss the play with the umpires. He did not immediately ask for a replay review.	"Brian said he missed him," Ventura explained. "I wish I could have watched the play."	Ventura returned to the dugout, then came back on the field after hearing from the team's replay staff. Umpires ruled the time for a challenge had lapsed because the manager had gone back to the dugout and the Tigers had inserted Andrew Romine to pinch run for Castellanos.	"The video shows what happened," Ramirez said. "It was clear. I'm 100 percent sure I tagged him."	Alex Avila sacrificed Romine to third, and Iglesias fouled off two 0-2 pitches before singling to right-center, just past second baseman Emilio Bonifacio's dive.	"When you are in that situation, you can't try to do too much," Iglesias said. "You just have to see the ball, make sure you can make contact and see what happens."	A second-inning home run by former Tiger Avisail Garcia put Chicago ahead. Yoenis Cespedes homered in the fourth, a drive that cleared the first section of seats in left.	David Price pitched four-hit ball over eight innings with nine strikeouts and two walks, and Joakim Soria (1-0) threw a perfect ninth.	Chicago starter Jeff Samardzija gave up one run and eight hits in eight innings, struck out seven and walked none.	"When you are facing their ace, you know you've got to be ready," Samarzjia said. "I knew I had to pound the strike zone, but the home run to Cespedes was basically the game. I wish I had that one back."	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox: RHP Jake Petricka, who has not pitched this season due to a forearm strain, began a rehab stint Thursday night with Triple-A Charlotte. Petricka pitched a perfect inning of relief and is scheduled to pitch again on Saturday.	Tigers: Victor Martinez was rested on Friday due to soreness. Martinez, limited to pinch hitting against Pittsburgh, looked noticeably uncomfortable during an at-bat on Tuesday, and Ausmus decided to give him one more day off. He is expected to play Saturday. ... Justin Verlander (triceps strain) will not come off the disabled list in time to make Tuesday's start against the Yankees. Kyle Lobstein will remain in the rotation.	UP NEXT	White Sox: Chris Sale (1-0, 1.50 ERA) will pitch against Detroit on Saturday. Sale has a 2.84 ERA, against the Tigers with 106 strikeouts in 92 innings and a .220 batting average but is just 5-5.	Tigers: Anibal Sanchez (1-1, 3.46 ERA) starts for the Tigers. He is 2-4 against the White Sox with a 3.72 ERA in six starts.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CHICAGO -- Kris Bryant absorbed the sights and smells and sounds of Wrigley Field. He cherished playing in front of 30,000 charged-up fans. He appreciated all the family members and friends who turned out for his big league debut.	Only two things were missing -- a hit and a win.	The prized power prospect of the Chicago Cubs struck out in his first three at-bats against James Shields and then grounded out in a key spot Friday during a 5-4 loss to the San Diego Padres.	"Sure, I could have done a little better," Bryant said. "There's two sides to the ball, I felt I did well on defense."	Called up one day after the Cubs ensured he can't be eligible for free agency until 2021, the 23-year-old who dominated in spring training went 0 for 4.	Seeking their first World Series title in 107 years, the Cubs selected Bryant's contract from Triple-A Iowa and inserted him into their starting lineup as the cleanup hitter and third baseman.	Bryant cleanly handled Derek Norris' sharp grounder in the first inning and started a double play.	After a two-out walk to Anthony Rizzo in the bottom half, Bryant drew a standing ovation as he came to the plate.	With fans still on their feet and taking picture, Bryant swung through three pitches for an inning-ending strikeout.	Bryant fell behind 0-2 when he led off the fourth, worked the count full and then swung over another changeup.	With a runner on first and two outs in the Padres fifth, he made a diving catch on Norris' liner, keeping the score 2-all. After the Cubs scored twice in the bottom half, he struck out on a cutter with runners at second and third	"He's a good player," said Shields (2-0), a former All-Star who started the World Series opener last October. "He's going to be just fine."	Wil Myers' three-run homer in the seventh off Brian Schlitter (0-1) put the Padres ahead 5-4.	With a runner on second and two outs in the Cubs seventh, Rizzo was intentionally walked. Bryant grounded into an inning-ending forceout.	"That's the situation you want to be in and I sure hope to be in that situation again throughout my career as many times as I can," Bryant said.	On the field before the game, Bryant embraced his father, former Boston minor league outfielder Mike Bryant. His dad watched from the stands next to his son's agent, Scott Boras.	"Kris proved at all levels he was ready to play in the major leagues and we are very happy for him and baseball he is a major leaguer," Boras said in a text message to The Associated Press.	Friday was Day 13 of the season, which means Bryant could at most accumulate 171 days of major league service. Because 172 days of service count as a year, he could have been eligible for free agency after the 2020 season had he been on the big league roster earlier.	When Bryant was sent to the minor leagues on March 30 after hitting .425 in spring training with nine homers and 15 RBIs in 40 at-bats, players' union head Tony Clark said "this decision and other similar decisions made by clubs will be addressed in litigation, bargaining or both."	After Bryant was brought up Friday, Clark said in an email to the AP: "nothing new to offer at this point."	That stuff wasn't much of a concern to Bryant.	"I sure hope I can look back on this and laugh at it 15 years from now," Bryant said. "It's all in the past."	Despite his reputation with the bat, the best part of Bryant's debut was his glove. He was flawless in the field and, at least for one day, quieted doubts about whether he should stay at the position.	"We did bring him up for his glove, didn't we?" manager Joe Maddon quipped. "He had a really good game at third base. Really played well over there."	Chicago third baseman Mike Olt was put on the disabled list Friday with a broken right wrist, a move retroactive to Wednesday. Cubs president of baseball operations Theo Epstein said Bryant would not have been called up if Olt had been able to play.	Epstein said the Cubs would have preferred Bryant's debut to come on the road.	"We would have done it a little bit later," Epstein said, "but you can't script everything out in baseball."	Bryant, selected by the Cubs with the second overall pick in the 2013 amateur draft, joins a young core that includes Rizzo, Jorge Soler and Starlin Castro.	"We're excited for Kris and his family and for the organization," Epstein said. "It's a great day and we hope the start of something special."	ADDISON COMING TO CLARK AND ADDISON?	With Bryant now in the major leagues, the top Cubs prospect in the minors is INF Addison Russell. Epstein said Russell is playing "really well" at Triple-A. Usually a shortstop, Russell played second base Thursday and should stay there through the weekend. "We've had a lot of injuries in the infield, we've had to shuffle some things," Epstein said. "He's going to continue to develop at Triple-A and we'll see what happens."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: RHP Ian Kennedy, on the 15-day disabled list with a strained left hamstring said he "felt great" following a 30-pitch bullpen session and will make a rehab start in an extended spring training game Monday in Arizona. He is expected to throw 70-90 pitches, manager Bud Black said.	Cubs: While Neil Ramirez was placed on the DL with right shoulder inflammation, Epstein said "all things considered, we got really good news" from an MRI that didn't show structural damage. . OF Chris Denorfia was activated from the disabled list following his recovery from a strained left hamstring.	UP NEXT	San Diego RHP Tyson Ross (1-0) faces RHP Kyle Hendricks (0-0) on Saturday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

WASHINGTON --  Max Scherzer kept the Phillies' lineup guessing even though he faced them earlier in the week. Against a struggling lineup, it wasn't too hard.	Scherzer pitched eight strong innings to get his first win with the Nationals and Bryce Harper hit a three-run homer as Washington beat the reeling Philadelphia Phillies 7-2 on Friday night.	Danny Espinosa also homered and Ryan Zimmerman added a two-run double to help the Nationals get their third straight win.	Scherzer (1-1) scattered four hits and one run and struck out nine in his third start since signing a seven-year, $210 million contract in January. The right-hander has allowed two earned runs and struck out 25 in 21 2/3 innings.	"I'm just glad he's on my team," Harper said of Scherzer. "He's a bulldog out there."	The Phillies have lost six in a row including the first two of the four-game series after opening the season 3-1. Odubel Herrera had two hits including a triple and scored Philadelphia's first run.	Scherzer and Sean O'Sullivan (0-1) met Sunday in Philadelphia, though neither figured into the decision as the Nationals won 4-3 in 10 innings.	In the rematch, Scherzer allowed two first-inning singles, but got Cody Asche to hit into an inning-ending groundout. He took control from there, striking out at least one batter in each of the next six innings.	"Remember, this is the ultimate game of paper, scissors, rock," Scherzer said after throwing 100 pitches and not issuing a walk. "You got to know when to stick with your strengths and when to try to go after weaknesses."	Philadelphia began the day having scored the second-fewest runs in the majors -- and have now totaled 26 in 11 games.	"I was hoping it would work to our advantage and have our hitters benefit from seeing him a week ago," Phillies manager Ryne Sandberg said. "That's what I was hoping for."	Herrera tripled off the right field wall in the third and made it 3-1 on Freddy Galvis's RBI groundout.	Espinosa's solo shot to center put the Nationals up 4-1 in the fourth, and Zimmerman's double highlighted a three-run seventh inning.	Nationals reliever Felipe Rivero allowed one run and three hits in the ninth inning in his major league debut.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: OF Domonic Brown (left achilles tendinitis) is expected to continue his rehab with Triple-A Lehigh Valley in its weekend series in Buffalo after going 5 for 17 in six games with Class A Clearwater. Brown was not in Friday's starting lineup for Lehigh Valley after playing in Clearwater on Thursday.	Nationals: Reliever Craig Stammen confirmed he will have surgery Sunday for a torn flexor tendon in his right forearm and could miss the rest of the season. ... Shortstop Yunel Escobar was removed before the top of the fifth inning  after straining his groin running out a grounder that ended the fourth. ... Outfielder Denard Span (core muscle surgery) played nine innings for Class A Hagerstown Friday night. He will work out with the Nationals Saturday and could be activated Sunday.	GOLD GLOVE AND BUTCHER HANDS.	Ryan Zimmerman continues looking quite comfortable at first base. Running in foul territory toward home plate, he made a full-stretch, diving catch on O'Sullivan's sacrifice bunt attempt in the fifth inning. Meanwhile, Ian Desmond continues laboring at his natural position. The shortstop could not get the ball out of his glove after fielding a grounder for his seventh error in 11 games.  Desmond had three singles and scored twice.	NO TAKE BACKS	O'Sullivan allowed two runs in Sunday's appearance. He gave up three to the first four batters in the rematch. After a single, a hit batter and one fly ball out, the righty hung a 1-2 curveball to Harper, who mashed the pitch over the center-field wall for his third home run of the season.	"I'd definitely like to take that one back," O'Sullivan said of the home run pitch.	UP NEXT	Phillies: Aaron Harang (1-1, 0.73) had a 1.33 ERA in four starts last season against Washington.	Nationals: Jordan Zimmermann (1-1, 8.64) makes his first for since allowing eight runs -- seven earned -- in 2 1/3 innings Monday at Boston.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PITTSBURGH --  The Pittsburgh Pirates flailed helplessly at Jimmy Nelson's curveball last weekend, striking out nine times in a lopsided loss in Milwaukee.	With a rematch looming Friday, manager Clint Hurdle ordered his players to spend a little more time in the batting cage while the pitching machine tried to replicate Nelson's sweeping breaking ball.	"Today was a day we were out there early in the afternoon," Hurdle said. "It gave us a better idea of what we would be getting."	Looked like it.	Gregory Polanco went 3 for 4, Starling Marte added two hits -- including a long two-run homer off Jonathan Broxton in the eighth -- and Pittsburgh rolled to a 6-3 win. The Pirates came in with the lowest team batting average in the National League (.207) but pounded out 11 hits and even managed their first walks since last Saturday.	"We did a better job situationally," Hurdle said. "We had some two-out hits as well. It was a good night to get some momentum on that side of the ball."	The Pirates have sputtered during the opening 10 days of the season as the offense that was supposed to be a strength has slouched out of the gate. Pittsburgh came in with the second-worst team batting average in the majors and managed just five hits total in back-to-back shutout losses to Detroit.	Hurdle shuffled the lineup a bit, moving Andrew McCutchen from third to cleanup. McCutchen drove in a run on a groundout in the fourth to end a 22-inning scoreless streak.	But the real damage off Nelson (1-1) came in the fifth. Marte led off with an infield single, stole second then scored on Sean Rodriguez base hit. Rodriguez followed suit, swiping second and then scoring on two-out single to left by Josh Harrison to give Pittsburgh a 3-1 lead that Vance Worley (1-1) and four relievers would not relinquish.	Worley, who was tagged for six runs by the Brewers in his last start, gave up just two in six effective innings. He struck out six, walked four and wriggled out of a two-on, one-out jam in the fifth, when Ryan Braun hit into an inning-ending double play.	"They were aggressive up there and I made sure I kept them more off balance," Worley said. "And when they started looking to hit the pitches I was throwing, I went back to what I used to do."	Polanco singled with one out in the ninth, stole second, moved to third on a throwing error and scored on a single by Pedro Alvarez through a drawn-in infield that made it 4-2 before Marte hit a 451-shot to the second deck in left against Broxton. The Brewers pulled within three in the ninth before closer Mark Melancon got the final out for his first save of the year.	Khris Davis had his sixth career three-hit game for the Brewers, who have lost three in a row. Milwaukee left eight men on base and went 1 for 7 with runners in scoring position.	"We get those guys out there and we're not picking them up.," Brewers manager Ron Roenicke said. "They get their guys out there and they're picking them up and that's the ballgame."	NO PANIC	Pittsburgh improved to 4-6 with the victory and Worley insisted there is no real concern in the clubhouse despite the slow start.	"We're all playing as hard as we can out there," he said. "We know it's early. Spring training was long but we've got some new guys here, we're all still learning each other and I think as the season progresses we'll only get better."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: All-Star outfielder Carlos Gomez's strained right hamstring landed him on the disabled list. Gomez left Wednesday's game in St. Louis with the injury and returned to Milwaukee to be examined. The leadoff hitter was batting .235 with a homer and six RBIs in eight games. Utility man Jason Rogers was recalled from Triple-A Colorado Springs.	Pirates: Pittsburgh activated catcher Chris Stewart off the 15-day disabled list and sent reserve catcher Tony Sanchez to Triple-A Indianapolis. Stewart missed the first eight games of the season with a strained right hamstring.	UP NEXT:	Brewers: Kyle Lohse looks to bounce back from a rare poor start against the Pirates when he faces Pittsburgh on Saturday. Lohse is 11-4 with a 3.81 ERA but was knocked around in a 10-2 loss last Sunday, giving up four runs in 6 1/3 innings.	Pirates: Second baseman Neil Walker returns to the starting lineup on Saturday. He was inserted as a pinch hitter on Friday while Rodriguez got the nod in his place, a planned move Hurdle said was designed to give Walker a little extra rest. Walker is a career .306 hitter against Lohse, his best average against any pitcher he's faced more than 30 times. Jeff Locke (1-0, 3.00) starts for the Pirates.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

TORONTO --  While Jonny Gomes is waiting for a pinch-hitting opportunity, he's never going to be forgotten about. He moves too much and makes too much noise to ever be overlooked.	Gomes had a pinch-hit, tiebreaking home run in the eighth inning, Freddie Freeman added a two-run shot and the Atlanta Braves beat the Toronto Blue Jays 8-7 on Friday night	Freeman said Gomes is hard to ignore in the Atlanta dugout.	"He's always in your way because he's never sitting down," Freeman said. "He's awesome. He's always screaming in the dugout, he's always keeping us loose, keeping us fired up."	He's always ready to hit, too.	Batting for Cameron Maybin, Gomes opened the eighth with a drive to center off Blue Jays left-hander Brett Cecil (0-1). It was Gomes' 10th career pinch-hit homer, the most among active players.	"I've been watching him do that for years now," Atlanta's Nick Markakis said of Gomes. "He's pretty damn good at it. It takes a lot of focus and work to be able to come in and pinch hit."	Gomes is 6 for 9 with two home runs against Cecil.	"You get an opportunity to get the matchup that I want in that situation and we used it, we took advantage of it," Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez said.	Markakis went 4 for 4 and scored three runs as the Braves won for the third time in their last 11 interleague road games.	"It's nice to see some of the guys start to start to swing the bat a little bit and get hot," Gonzalez said.	Two outs after Gomes' homer, Markakis singled and Freeman followed with a second-deck drive, his third.	Cody Martin (1-0) worked one inning for the win, Jim Johnson gave up two runs in the eighth and Jason Grilli finished for his fifth save.	Toronto hit five home runs, including four off Braves starter Julio Teheran, but still lost for the fourth time in five games. Josh Donaldson and Russell Martin both hit two homers, while rookie Devon Travis also connected.	Making his first start in the leadoff spot in place of the injured Jose Reyes, Travis put the Blue Jays on top with a homer in the first, his third. Travis is the first Blue Jays rookie to hit a leadoff homer since Russ Adams did it against the Yankees on Aug. 22, 2004.	Atlanta tied it in the second on Eric Young's two-out single, then took the lead on A.J. Pierzynski's RBI single in the third.	Martin tied it in the bottom half with his first homer of the season, snapping an 0 for 22 slump. He went deep again to begin the eighth, giving him his ninth career multihomer game. The homers were Martin's second and third hits of the season, boosting his average from .042 to .111.	"It's definitely encouraging but it's not really satisfying when you don't end up winning the game," Martin said.	Donaldson hit a two-run homer in the third, his first for Toronto, to put the Blue Jays up 4-2, but Atlanta reclaimed the lead with a two-out rally in the fifth. Andrelton Simmons chased Drew Hutchison with a two-run double and Jace Peterson greeted Roberto Osuna with a tiebreaking triple.	Donaldson connected again in the bottom of the fifth to tie it 5-all. It was the fourth multihomer game of his career.	PINCHED	Blue Jays pitchers have allowed pinch-hit home runs in back-to-back games after not allowing one in their previous 279 games. Tampa Bay rookie Tim Beckham hit a pinch-hit homer off Aaron Loup in Thursday's Rays win. Before that, the last pinch-hitter to go deep against Toronto was Atlanta's Reed Johnson on May 30, 2013.	IN THE BAG	In the third, a fan seated behind first base caught a foul ball off the bat of Atlanta's Chris Johnson in his bag of snacks. He reached into the bag and pulled out the ball to cheers from nearby fans.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: Reyes has a cracked rib on his left side and will miss this weekend's series against Atlanta. Reyes won't play again until at least Tuesday against Baltimore. Toronto is off Monday.	UP NEXT	Braves LH Alex Wood (1-0) faces Blue Jays RH R.A. Dickey (0-1) on Saturday afternoon. Dickey issued five walks in his previous start, the most he'd allowed since April 17, 2014, at Minnesota.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BOSTON --  The Red Sox managed just four hits and still won. They might have had even fewer if Orioles starter Ubaldo Jimenez hadn't been ejected.	Xander Bogaerts blooped a winning single in the ninth and Boston beat Baltimore 3-2 Friday night. It was Bogaerts' second hit of the game and boosted his batting average to .382, best among Boston's regulars.	When you're going good, even lightly hit balls drop in.	"Yeah, because when you're going bad, you don't get anything," Bogaerts said.	Jimenez was long gone by then after allowing no hits in 3 2/3 innings -- following his other start of the year in which he gave up one hit in seven scoreless innings. Plate umpire Jordan Baker ejected him quickly after he hit Pablo Sandoval in the right shoulder.	"It was my first one. I was shocked," Jimenez said. "He's a good hitter and I'm trying to go inside. "	In the second, Sandoval took out second baseman Jonathan Schoop with a hard slide on a force play. Sandoval missed Boston's previous game Wednesday, a day after bruising his left foot when he was hit by a pitch.	"I slide hard to the base. It's nothing wrong with that," said Sandoval, who didn't think Jimenez was trying to hit him.	Baltimore manager Buck Showalter agreed.	"Every time somebody slides hard, that's what you're supposed to do," he said. "Nobody gets mad."	Mike Napoli began the ninth with a walk from Brian Matusz (0-1) and Daniel Nava sacrificed. Tommy Hunter relieved, and Bogaerts hit a ball over Schoop and in front of right fielder Travis Snider.	Napoli, a smart runner with below-average speed, got a good jump and easily beat the throw home on Boston's fourth hit of the game.	"He's one of our best base runners," Boston manager John Farrell said.	Koji Uehara (1-0) struck out two in a perfect ninth, completing a strong performance by a bullpen that allowed one of Baltimore's five hits.	"Hits were hard to come by," Farrell said.	The Orioles took a 1-0 lead in the fourth when Snider singled, took third on a single by Adam Jones and scored on a double-play grounder by Chris Davis.	Caleb Joseph led off the fourth with his first homer of the year just inside the right field foul pole for a 2-0 lead. Shane Victorino hit his left side hard against the wall trying to catch it. He stayed in the game before Nava pinch hit for him in the sixth, but Farrell said Victorino wasn't hurt.	The Red Sox tied it in the fifth when Bogaerts singled off Kevin Gausman for their first hit and Ryan Hanigan hit his first homer.	Boston's Joe Kelly gave up two runs and four hits and left with two outs in the sixth after throwing 118 pitches, the most in the majors this season. The previous high was 113 by Jeff Samardzija with the Chicago White Sox against Minnesota on April 11.	BIG WORKLOAD	Kelly showed good endurance despite having started the season on the disabled list with a right biceps strain. He threw two fewer pitches than his career high.	"They're a good-hitting team and they were fouling off some pitches," he said. "They put together some pretty tough at bats."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: Shortstop J.J. Hardy could begin a rehab assignment next week. Manager Buck Showalter said he's hoping for that as Hardy comes back from a left shoulder injury he suffered on March 27. Hardy took ground balls at Double-A Bowie on Friday. He also hit and threw after taking Thursday off.	Red Sox: 3B Sandoval was hurt Tuesday night when he was hit by a pitch from Stephen Strasburg in an 8-7 win over Washington. He left that game in the top of the sixth. The Red Sox were off Thursday.	UP NEXT	Orioles: RH Chris Tillman (1-1, 3.86 ERA) makes his third start of the season Saturday in the second game of the four-game series.	Red Sox: RH Clay Buchholz (1-1, 7.84) pitches his first game at Fenway Park this season after allowing 10 runs in 3 1/3 innings in a 14-4 loss to the New York Yankees. In Boston's first game of the season, he gave up three hits in seven scoreless innings in an 8-0 win at Philadelphia.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

NEW YORK --  Mets fans roared at Bartolo Colon's sacrifice fly and fine fielding play. They cheered Juan Lagares' diving catch. And they high-fived one another after the final out of another victory.	Indeed, as the song blaring throughout Citi Field reminded all celebrating, the team that's played second fiddle in the Big Apple to the Yankees for more than a decade is back in a "New York Groove."	Colon tied it with his second RBI in two starts, later pounced off the mound to protect a lead with his glove, and pitched the Mets past the Miami Marlins 4-1 Friday night for their sixth straight win.	"I just think everybody's caught up in it," manager Terry Collins said.	Colon (3-0) gave up Giancarlo Stanton's second homer of the series in the first inning, then allowed just five more hits through seven to win his third consecutive start.	Michael Cuddyer had a go-ahead single in the sixth for New York, Eric Campbell added a sacrifice fly and Juan Lagares made two nimble catches in center field on the night he collected his 2014 Gold Glove award. The Mets last won six in a row in April 2011.	Jeurys Familia pitched the ninth for his fifth save.	Stanton has homered in five straight games against the Mets dating to last season, matching the team mark for an opponent shared by Hank Aaron and Ryan Howard.	"Yeah, it's great," Stanton said sarcastically. "We are still doing terrible."	Making a start in place of injured right-hander Henderson Alvarez just four days after the birth of his son and making his regular bullpen session at La Roche College in Pittsburgh, David Phelps held the Mets hitless until Wilmer Flores singled with one out in the fourth.	Phelps walked two around that single to load the bases for Colon, who had his first RBI in a decade in his previous start.	Colon hit a line drive to center field to make it 1-all to the delight of the 38,753 in attendance on Matt Harvey T-shirt night.	Colon, who went 2 for 62 at the plate last season without an RBI, has only one other season in which he drove in more than one run: 2002 when he had three for Montreal.	"I've been taking it more seriously and with more responsibility to hit because it's my second full year in the National League," Colon said through a translator.	Phelps was then lifted for Brad Hand (0-1) after throwing 75 pitches.	Stanton broke the Marlins' career homer record with his 155th on Thursday. His opposite-field drive cleared the new pulled-in fence in right-center at Citi Field.	Cuddyer hit an opposite-field RBI single in the sixth past diving first baseman Michael Morse, who was playing on the grass, with Lagares on first. Running on the full-count pitch, Lagares advanced to third. He scored on Campbell's fly off reliever Sam Dyson for a 3-1 lead.	Colon gave up singles to Martin Prado and Ichiro Suzuki in the seventh, the first time Miami had two runners on base. But Lagares made a diving catch, running in on J.T. Realmuto's sinking liner for the second out.	Adeiny Hechavarria then hit a chopper between the mound and third and Colon, portly and nearly 42, rushed off the mound, made a nice backhanded grab and throw to first. He clapped into his glove as he strolled off the mound.	"We are not giving ourselves a chance it feels like," Stanton said. "We have a positive vibe but the fire is not there, it seems like."	Lagares also made a long running catch on Christian Yelich's fly to left-center in the third.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: Manager Mike Redmond held CF Marcell Ozuna out of the starting lineup to give him a day off. Ozuna is batting .194 (6 for 31) to begin the season.	Mets: RHP Vic Black (shoulder) pitched a hitless inning for Class A St. Lucie. He could be back in a week. ... Closer Bobby Parnell (Tommy John surgery) allowed two runs, two hits and a walk in an inning for St. Lucie.	UP NEXT	Marlins: Mat Latos (0-2) is looking for his first win with Miami. Acquired from the Reds in December during the winter meetings, he's allowed 10 runs and 11 hits in 4 2/3 innings this year.	Mets: In his last start against Miami, Jacob deGrom opened the game Sept. 15 with a record-tying eight straight strikeouts.	40-40 CLUB	In a matchup of baseball senior citizens, the 41-year-old Suzuki went 1 for 3 against Colon, who turns 42 on May 24. Since turning 40 in 2013, Colon has only faced one other fortysomething: Raul Ibanez, according to STATS.	"I remember playing against Bartolo Colon in A ball," said Redmond, who will be 44 on May 5.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- The New York Yankees used Alex Rodriguez's big game to get a win on the road, and that was the most important part for the slugger.	Rodriguez inched closer to Willie Mays with two more home runs, and the Yankees beat the Tampa Bay Rays 5-4 on Friday night.	"We needed this one badly," Rodriguez said after New York's fourth victory in 10 games this season.	Rodriguez hit a solo shot in the second, driving an 0-1 pitch from Nathan Karns an estimated 471 feet to center. He connected again in the sixth, belting a two-run drive to left against Ernesto Frieri for homer No. 658 -- just two shy of Mays for fourth place on baseball's career list.	"I am," Rodriguez said when asked if he is surprised by his start. "Hopefully it keeps going."	Rodriguez, who missed last season because of a drug suspension, also had a tiebreaking RBI single on a 3-2 pitch in the eighth against Kevin Jepsen (0-1). Brett Gardner, who came in to run for Carlos Beltran after his leadoff single, stole second before Rodriguez singled to center with two out.	Rays manager Kevin Cash said there was no consideration given about intentionally walking Rodriguez, who is batting .344 with four homers and 11 RBIs.	"With Kevin Jepsen on the mound, we'll pitch to anyone in baseball," Cash said.	It was Rodriguez's first multihomer game since May 23, 2012, and No. 61 for his career. He also moved past former teammate Derek Jeter for ninth place on the runs scored list with 1,925.	"Without Alex we're going to lose that ballgame," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "Just a great night for Alex."	After Dellin Betances (2-0) threw a scoreless inning, Andrew Miller got the final four outs for his third save.	Allan Dykstra and Logan Forsythe hit consecutive homers in the fourth to give Tampa Bay a 4-2 lead. Dykstra had been 1 for 15 this season before hitting a three-run drive off Adam Warren for his first major league homer.	Stephen Drew put the Yankees up 2-0 in the fourth with his 100th career homer.	Karns allowed two runs and two hits in five innings. He struck out seven and walked four.	Warren gave up four runs and six hits over four innings.	Rays third baseman Evan Longoria went 1 for 3 and walked once while serving as the designated hitter. He left Thursday night's game at Toronto in the eighth inning with a bruised left hip after getting hit by a pitch.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: Gardner (right wrist) was out of the starting lineup for the third straight game. He could start Saturday ... RHP Ivan Nova (elbow surgery) threw 20 pitches in his second batting practice session. ... INF-OF Jose Pirela (concussion) hit off Nova.	Rays: RHP Alex Cobb (right forearm tendinitis) said he might throw off a mound in seven to 10 days. ... Closer Jake McGee (right elbow surgery) is nearing the start of a minor league rehab assignment.	MORE A-ROD	It was Rodriguez's sixth multihomer game against the Rays. He went 3 for 4 while the rest of the Yankees' lineup had two hits in 26 at-bats.	BROTHERS	Stephen Drew and his brother J.D. Drew (242) are the eighth set of brothers with at least 100 homers apiece. The list includes Joe and Vince DiMaggio.	UP NEXT	Yankees: Saturday starter Masahiro Tanaka (1-1, 7.00 ERA) has lasted just four and five innings in his first two starts.	Rays: RHP Jake Odorizzi (2-0, 0.61 ERA) gets the ball for Tampa Bay. He has won consecutive starts of six-plus innings, two or fewer hits and one run or less.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  The Royals and A's picked up right where they left off. On Friday night, it nearly turned into punches.	In their first meeting since last September's dramatic wild-card game, Paulo Orlando delivered a go-ahead triple in the eighth inning to help Kansas City to a 6-4 win.	The victory nearly came at a big loss for the Royals when shortstop Alcides Escobar was run over by the Athletics' Brett Lawrie covering second base. The Royals took umbrage with Lawrie's late slide, and both benches quickly emptied before order was restored.	"I can't judge intent," said Royals manager Ned Yost, who later acknowledged that he didn't think Lawrie was trying to hurt Escobar when he slid over the bag.	Escobar was diagnosed with a sprained knee and likely will be sidelined for a few days.	"I'm trying to break up a double play there. It's a tie game. No one is trying to hurt anyone there," Lawrie said. "That's just playing the game hard."	Omar Infante drove in a pair of runs for the Royals, whose 12-inning victory over the A's last year ultimately spurred them all the way to Game 7 of the World Series.	Kelvin Herrera and Wade Davis (2-0) each pitched a scoreless inning in relief of Jeremy Guthrie, and Greg Holland breezed through the ninth for his fourth save.	Dan Otero (0-1) gave up both runs in the eighth inning for Oakland.	"It was eerily similar to about six months ago," said the A's Stephen Vogt, who played in that wild playoff game at Kauffman Stadium that ended their season.	Vogt had a pair of solo homers Friday night, and Ike Davis also went deep for the A's, whose team bears little resemblance to the one from a year ago. For one thing, their designated hitter these days is Billy Butler, who was playing for the Royals back then.	Butler went 1 for 4, extending his hitting streak to 10 games to start the season.	"I was trying to do too much," he said, "and I don't do well when I'm trying to do too much."	The A's jumped in front on Lawrie's sacrifice bunt in the second inning, and Kansas City pulled ahead with five straight two-out singles in the third.	Oakland quickly answered when Davis homered on the first pitch he saw in the fourth, and Vogt tied it at 3 with his first homer just two pitches later.	Kansas City went in front again in the sixth on Infante's single, but Yost elected to leave Guthrie in rather than go to Herrera at that point. Vogt made him pay with a drive to right for his first career multihomer game.	Later in the inning, Lawrie was on first base when Josh Reddick lined a pitch off Herrera toward third, where Mike Moustakas fielded it. He flipped to Escobar covering second, but Lawrie's late slide over the bag caused a collision that left Escobar crumpled on the dirt.	He was helped off the field without putting any weight on his left leg, while Lawrie had to be escorted by his teammates through a horde of angry Royals and back to the Oakland dugout.	"It was a weird play," said Royals first baseman Eric Hosmer, who had a good view of the play. "It was obviously late, but I don't think he meant anything by it."	Yost said that he was worried that Escobar may have "torn up his knee," but he was reassured by trainer Nick Kenney that the injury is not considered serious.	"It looks like it's going to be a bruise more than anything," Yost said.	GRAY POUNDED	A's starter Sonny Gray gave up four runs and a career-high 11 hits in six innings. He tossed eight innings of shutout ball against Texas and allowed one earned run in 7 1/3 innings against Seattle in his first two starts of the season.	DISTRIBUTING HARDWARE	Butler received his AL championship ring before the game. Royals C Salvador Perez, 1B Hosmer and LF Alex Gordon received their Gold Glove awards. Gordon also received a Platinum Glove as the American League's best defensive player.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: RHP Jarrod Parker (Tommy John surgery) is scheduled to throw three innings in extended spring training Saturday. On Monday, LHP Sean Nolin (sports hernia surgery) will throw two innings, and RHP A.J. Griffin will throw one inning.	Royals: Escobar was replaced in the lineup by Christian Colon, who is likely to start at shortstop Saturday. Escobar had started the club's first nine games.	UP NEXT	Athletics: RHP Jesse Hahn faces the Royals for the first time in his career.	Royals: RHP Yordano Ventura makes his third start of the season. He left his first two with cramps, first to his right thumb and then to his right calf.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Trevor Plouffe stepped to the plate in the 11th inning with a .118 batting average after opening the season with just four hits in his first 34 at-bats.	With one mammoth swing, he took out two weeks' worth of frustration and sent the Minnesota Twins to a third straight victory.	Plouffe's soaring home run lifted Minnesota to a 3-2 win over the Cleveland Indians on Friday night.	Plouffe connected against Bryan Shaw (0-1), sending a drive into the second deck in left field. He stared into the dugout as he jogged to first base, not needing to see the pitch land in the seats.	"I usually don't react like that, but there was a lot of frustration coming out right there," Plouffe said. "It was a great win for us."	Chris Herrmann had two hits, an RBI and some slick baserunning to help the Twins continue their rebound from an ugly 1-6 start. Plouffe was right in the center of those struggles, including some difficulties in the field at third base.	"The biggest thing is you just see the awful numbers on the scoreboard that you can't hide from," Plouffe said. "But you just have to trust the process and know that's going to happen throughout the year. Can't get too low or too high."	Brandon Moss homered for the Indians (3-6), who fell to 0-3 in games pitched by AL Cy Young Award winner Corey Kluber.	Kluber was perfect through five innings, but uncharacteristically erratic after that. He gave up two runs and three hits in eight innings. He struck out eight, but also threw two wild pitches and hit a batter.	It was the second time this season that Kluber took a no-hit bid into the sixth inning. He also did it on opening day at Houston.	Blaine Boyer (1-1) went 1 1/3 innings for the win.	Kluber was in complete control at the start against a Twins lineup with five players hitting .200 or lower.	Then, seemingly out of nowhere, the Indians and Kluber came unglued in the sixth.	Oswaldo Arcia, who had struck out 12 times in 17 career at-bats against Kluber, led off with a single to right field and moved to second on a wild pitch. Herrmann followed with an RBI single and moved up to second on a throwing error by Moss in right field.	Then shortstop Jose Ramirez fielded a hard grounder from Jordan Schafer and tried to get Herrmann at third base. Herrmann made a nifty slide to avoid a tag, and then scored on Kluber's second wild pitch of the inning.	Kluber had only three wild pitches all of last season and would have matched that number had his errant delivery in the eighth not hit Eduardo Escobar in the left foot.	"The one where the run scored, that's what we were trying to do. Go down with the cutter, get him to swing at it," Kluber said. "But sometimes those get by."	Michael Brantley returned to the Indians' lineup after missing four games with a bad back and went 2 for 5 as the designated hitter.	PELFREY'S START	Minnesota's Mike Pelfrey breezed through three innings before losing control. He only gave up one run and three hits, but four walks cut his start short at five innings. His wild pitch in the fifth allowed the Indians to get on the board.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: Carlos Carrasco threw a bullpen three days after being struck in the face by a line drive. Manager Terry Francona said everything went well and Carrasco is on track to start Monday.	Twins: Escobar left the game after being hit in the eighth. ... LHP Brian Duensing was placed on the 15-day disabled list with an intercostal strain, an injury to the muscles in his rib cage. GM Terry Ryan said Duensing first felt tightness on Monday, but tried to pitch through it. Caleb Thielbar was recalled to take his place.	UP NEXT	Indians: RHP Danny Salazar will make his season debut in game two of  the series after being called up from Triple-A Columbus. Francona said the plan is to leave him in the rotation for a while and keep Zach McAllister in the bullpen.	Twins: RHP Phil Hughes (0-2, 5.25 ERA) will look to get on track after a sketchy first two trips to the mound this season. Hughes is the team's ace, and is being counted on more than ever after Ervin Santana was suspended for 80 games and Ricky Nolasco hit the disabled list with elbow problems.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

HOUSTON --  Mike Trout was more concerned about getting a win than setting a record.	Trout homered twice to become the youngest player in history with 100 home runs and 100 stolen bases, and Los Angeles beat the Astros 6-3 on Friday night.	"I'm just glad we got the `W," Trout said.	Trout, who has 104 steals, hit a two-run shot off Astros starter Roberto Hernandez on a full count in the sixth inning for his 100th homer, giving the Angels a 3-1 lead. At 23 years and 253 days old, Trout became the youngest player in history to reach the feat -- breaking the mark set by Alex Rodriguez (23 years, 309 days old).	After the Astros tied it with single runs in the sixth and seventh, Trout hit a three-run shot against reliever Chad Qualls (0-1) in the eighth.	The homers gave Trout three for the season and his fourth career multihomer game -- the first since last Sept. 13 against Houston.	"Mike got big hits all night for us," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "Good day for Mike; they were all clutch."	Angels starter Jered Weaver was also impressed by Trout's latest feat.	"Guy's unbelievable," Weaver said. "Nothing he does surprises me anymore. He's doing things no one's ever done before."	Cesar Ramos (1-0) got the last two outs of the seventh to pick up the win and Huston Street pitched a scoreless ninth for his fourth save.	Kole Calhoun went 2 for 3 with a triple, a walk and three runs scored for Los Angeles in his first start since missing the previous four with tightness in his right calf.	Weaver gave up two runs and six hits in six innings. He seemed to tire his last two innings, and conceded the humidity might have played a factor. Houston was under a flash flood warning for much of the game and several Angels players said water was leaking from the roof in the outfield.	"A win is always a big step in the right direction," Weaver said. "I was sweating pretty good there in the fifth inning."	Hernandez gave up three runs and three hits while striking out six in six innings for Houston.	Evan Gattis went 2-for-4 with a double for the Astros, who fell to 2-5 at home.	Calhoun tripled to lead off the fourth inning and scored on Matt Joyce's sacrifice fly to put the Angels up 1-0.	Jose Altuve drove in a run in the fifth to tie the score at 1-1, and Jason Castro homered in the bottom of the sixth to keep Houston close after Trout's first homer.	The Astros loaded the bases with no outs in the seventh off relievers Jose Alvarez and Vinnie Pestano, and George Springer tied it at 3-3 with a sacrifice fly.	MEETING WITH HAMILTON	Scioscia met with Josh Hamilton this week for the first time in months and said he isn't sure when the star will return to the team.	Scioscia said he had dinner with Hamilton on Wednesday night when the Angels arrived in Houston. It was the first time Scioscia had seen Hamilton since the slugger self-reported a relapse into substance abuse.	Scioscia says the former AL MVP is making progress in his recovery from offseason shoulder surgery.	The manager declined to discuss many details of their meeting, except to say that Hamilton is running and hitting and that "there's still some work he has to do before he's ready to play a game."	GOLDEN BOY	Astros LHP Dallas Keuchel was presented with his 2014 Gold Glove in a pregame ceremony.  He is the first Astros pitcher and eighth player overall to win the defensive honor	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: RHP Garrett Richards, who is recovering from left knee surgery, threw a bullpen session, and Scioscia said he will decide Saturday whether Richards gets another rehab assignment or pitches. "There's no doubt he's close," Scioscia said.	Astros: RHP Brad Peacock was placed on the 15-day disabled list retroactive to April 15 with a left intercostal strain. "It's unbelievably frustrating," Peacock said of the injury, which he first felt during Tuesday's start against Oakland. Peacock was coming back from offseason hip surgery. ... Houston recalled RHP Asher Wojciechowski from Triple-A Fresno. Wojciechowski was sent down Monday night after pitching four shutout innings in relief to make room for Peacock on the roster.

ST. LOUIS --  Even with less than his best stuff, Cardinals starter Michael Wacha was good enough to beat the Cincinnati Reds again.	Wacha served a first-inning homer to Joey Votto but did not give up another run in seven innings and Yadier Molina delivered a bases-clearing double to break a 1-1 tie in the bottom of the seventh as the Cardinals beat the Reds 6-1 on Friday night.	The win was Wacha's second in a week over the Reds and their ace, Johnny Cueto. In eight career outings against Cincinnati, Wacha owns a 2.01 ERA and 3-1 record. He handled the Reds in this game even though his best pitch, his changeup, was not particularly sharp.	"Michael was good but it wasn't his typical stuff," manager Mike Matheny said. "The changeup was good but it seemed like it had a different feel. It was nice to see him figure out a way to pitch with a different style."	Wacha said the key was calming down.	"Early on, I was a little jumpy," Wacha said. "I was just a little too excited out there, leaving some balls up. After the first couple of innings, I was able to settle down and start working down in the zone."	Cueto, winless in three starts, matched Wacha through six innings before the Cardinals broke through in the seventh. With the score 1-1, Matt Holliday led off with a single to right field. He went to third on a one-out double by Jhonny Peralta that landed just in front of left fielder Marlon Byrd and bounced past him.	After Jon Jay was intentionally walked, Molina lined the first pitch from Cueto down the left-field line that scored three.	"There's no reason to get beat right there by Jay," Reds manager Bryan Price said. "In the end it's just the best decision to walk Jay and go after Molina and have an idea of how we want to get the ball on the ground. It just didn't happen."	Molina said he understood why Price decided to walk Jay.	"That's baseball," Molina said. "Try to get a good pitch to hit and try to make good contact. Everybody knows I've been in the league 12 years and I'm an aggressive guy. It was special, a good moment."	Votto gave Cincinnati a first-inning lead with his fourth homer, his third against St. Louis, before Matt Carpenter tied the game in the bottom of the inning. He doubled, went to third on a groundout and scored when he somersaulted over catcher Brayan Pena on Holliday's fly to short center.	"I either could run through him or go over him," Carpenter said. "At the last (second), I saw the opportunity to go above him and it ended up working out. I've never done anything like that."	RED'S NIGHT	To mark the 70th anniversary of his major league debut, Hall of Famer Red Schoendienst was honored before the game. He batted third, tripled and scored in a 3-2 loss at Wrigley Field and went on to hit .289 in a 19-year career. Schoendienst, 92, remains a special assistant with St. Louis. "With Mr. (Stan) Musial no longer with us, Red's taken that banner for what a Cardinal looks like," manager Mike Matheny said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: C Devin Mesoraco (left hip) returned to the club after missing the team's series in Chicago but was not in the starting lineup. Mesoraco, 2 for 21 for the season, has not played since Sunday and is not likely to return behind the plate this weekend. C Tucker Barnhart was called up Friday and could back up Pena.	Cardinals: LHP Jaime Garcia, trying to come back from last year's left shoulder surgery, faced minor-league hitters at extended spring training in Jupiter, Florida. He remains weeks away from a possible return, general manager John Mozeliak said.	UP NEXT	Reds RHP Homer Bailey is scheduled to make his 2015 debut when he opposes RHP Carlos Martinez Saturday afternoon. Bailey underwent surgery last September to repair a torn flexor tendon in his right forearm.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

SEATTLE --  Yovani Gallardo pitched to his strength against the Seattle Mariners: his defense.	Gallardo induced 11 ground-ball outs, including three double plays, in his six scoreless innings to help the Texas Rangers beat the Mariners 3-1 Friday night.	"We have a good defense. We have some guys back there who can play good defense," said Gallardo (2-1). "They're going to do everything they can to get one out or turn the double play."	Rangers manager Jeff Banister was also pleased with Gallardo's outing.	"He made first-strike pitches tonight, getting ahead and pounding the ball in the zone," Banister said. "He was able to throw his secondary pitches when he needed to.	"But more impressively, he was able to work vertically. He got his fastball above the bat then dropped down for effect and induced 11 ground-ball outs."	Robinson Chirinos homered as the Rangers handed the Mariners their fourth straight loss.	Nelson Cruz had three hits, all singles, for Seattle to end his power streak. He had hit five home runs in the previous five games.	"He (Gallardo) kept the ball down and elevated up and in when he needed to," Cruz said.	Shawn Tolleson took over the Gallardo in the seventh worked out of a two-on, no-out jam. First baseman Adam Rosales made a diving stop to save a run and force a runner at second. Tolleson then struck out Dustin Ackley and Mike Zunino.	"After Adam made that play at first I tried to throw it where they couldn't hit it," Tolleson said. "I was able to go up and in on those last two guys and get a swing and a miss."	Tanner Scheppers, just off the disabled list, gave up a run in the eighth on Seth Smith's sacrifice fly.	Neftali Feliz got the last three outs for his second save. It was also Feliz's 12th save in 12 chances against Seattle.	"We had our opportunities," Mariners manager Lloyd McClendon said. "We just couldn't get the big hit to get us over the hump."	Prince Fielder put the Rangers ahead with an RBI double in the first, driving in Leonys Martin from first base. Chirinos made it 2-0 in the fifth with his second homer of the season, and Rosales added a two-out RBI single in the ninth.	Mariners starter J.A. Happ (0-1) gave up two runs and six hits in seven innings, walking two and striking out three.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: RHP Tom Wilhelmson (hyper extended right elbow), who was placed on the DL last Saturday (retroactive to April 11) has spent the week resting his arm. He's expected to begin throwing again this weekend.	Rangers: 1B Mitch Moreland was a late scratch because of a sore left elbow. Rosales started at first.	CLOSING THE DOOR	Feliz has thrown 27 scoreless innings in 22 appearances against the Mariners. Seattle batters have hit just .080 against him (7 of 87) overall and .031 (1 of 32) at Safeco Field.	CLOSE BY HIS SIDE	Mariners manager Lloyd McClendon is not concerned over the uneven performances of closer Fernando Rodney against the L.A. Dodgers this week. He blew one save and gave up four runs in the ninth in another. "It's not the first time he's struggled and it won't be the last time he struggles. ...Trust me, closers don't grow on trees. I have full confidence that he'll bounce back and get it done."	UP NEXT	Mariners: There was some uncertainty whether RHP Felix Hernandez (1-0, 3.00) would make his scheduled start Saturday because of a tweaked ankle and tender quadriceps. But he downplayed the injuries and manager Lloyd McClendon said he will be ready. The Mariners have not had a win from a starter since Hernandez's Opening Day victory.	Rangers: RHP Colby Lewis (1-0, 3.38) has had six-days rest since his last start Sunday against Houston, a 6-4 loss. He has a career 3.91 ERA against Seattle and has thrown two complete games in Safeco Field.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

LOS ANGELES --  It took Clayton Kershaw three starts to get his first victory and he still is trying to find his groove after putting together one of the greatest seasons any pitcher ever had.	The reigning NL MVP gave up two home runs against the Colorado Rockies, but struck out 12 over six innings Friday night to help the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Colorado Rockies 7-3.	The only other Dodgers to fan 12 in a six-inning start were Sandy Koufax (1963), Darren Dreifort (2003), Chad Billingsley (2008), Charlie Haeger (2010) and Hyun-Jin Ryu (2013).	"Obviously I threw too many pitches, but it was a little bit better," Kershaw said after his 104-pitch outing. "My job is to go seven or eight innings every time. But give credit to the Rockies. They did a great job of battling and fouling off pitches. It just feels good to get a win."	Kershaw (1-1) allowed three runs -- one earned -- and six hits, improving to 21-2 with a 1.69 ERA in his last 24 regular-season starts.	The three-time Cy Young Award winner wasn't nearly as dominating against the Rockies as he was last June, when he no-hit them. Kershaw surrendered a fourth-inning leadoff homer to Troy Tulowitzki and a two-run shot by Charlie Blackmon with two out in the fifth. Nevertheless, the 27-year-old left-hander is 12-2 with a 3.11 ERA in his last 19 starts against Colorado.	"There are things that I'd like to get better at," Kershaw said. "I think my fastball location was a little better. I still missed up quite a bit, like I did with those two heaters on the home runs. But I'm still getting better with the off-speed stuff and I worked that in a little bit more."	Kyle Kendrick (1-2) gave up six runs in the loss, including the first National League home run by Howie Kendrick.	"It's pretty funny when you're facing somebody with the same last name," the Dodgers' second baseman and cleanup hitter said. "I faced him before when he was with the Phillies during interleague play with the Angels. We actually swapped jerseys at that time, and we never even planned it. It just happened that way."	Colorado absorbed its first road loss after three-game sweeps at Milwaukee and San Francisco. The Rockies began this series with a one-game lead over the two-time defending NL West champion Dodgers, after finishing last season 28 games behind them with 96 losses.	Kyle Kendrick gave up seven hits and four walks in 4 2/3 innings and was behind 3-0 in the first on just 15 pitches.	Jimmy Rollins, a teammate of the right-hander's in Philadelphia during the previous eight seasons, drew a leadoff walk from him in the first and stole second with one out before Adrian Gonzalez hit one over the head of center fielder Drew Stubbs for the first of his two RBI doubles.	"A leadoff walk can't happen, and I walked the leadoff guy," Kendrick said. "They swung the bats pretty well, and I made some mistakes that got hit."	Howie Kendrick, who hit all 78 of his previous homers with the Angels in nine seasons, sent the next pitch into the left field pavilion.	"It's just another one in the books, I guess. It's cool because it put a couple more runs on the board," he said. "He left a few balls up over the plate for us, and we didn't miss them."	Kershaw struck out the side on 16 pitches in the second inning and retired nine of his first 10 batters before Tulowitzki lined a 1-2 pitch into the lower seats in the left field corner to trim the Dodgers' lead to 3-1. It was his first home run of the season and 17th against Los Angeles.	Two batters later, Willin Rosario lined a single through the box that sent Kershaw spinning out of the way. Rosario stole second and tried to score on a two-out single by Corey Dickerson, but right fielder Andre Ethier made a perfect one-hop throw to Yasmani Grandal to get him.	The Dodgers made it 4-1 in the bottom of the fourth, when Grandal scored on Kendrick's wild pitch to Kershaw after a two-out intentional walk to Joc Pederson.	Blackmon responded in the sixth with his first homer in 61 career at-bats at Dodger Stadium. But LA extended the margin to 6-3 in the bottom of the inning with RBI doubles by Kendrick and Gonzalez, who is 22 for 40 with 11 RBIs and five home runs in his first 10 games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: RF Yasiel Puig sat out his third game with tightness in his left hamstring. His status lies somewhere between late-inning pinch-hitter or possibly landing on the disabled list, which was as specific as manager Don Mattingly could get during his pregame session with reporters.	UP NEXT	Rockies: RHP Jordan Lyles (1-0) is 0-2 in three starts against Los Angeles, allowing 14 runs in 17 2/3 innings. He comes off a six-inning no decision against the Cubs in which his teammates committed three errors, resulting in two unearned runs.	Dodgers: RHP Zack Greinke (1-0) has allowed only one home run in 51 innings over his last eight regular-season starts. He is 6-2 with a 3.53 ERA in 13 career starts against Colorado.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Josh Collmenter stayed loose and kept his legs warm on a chilly night by running the bases, and Arizona's starting pitcher delivered by not only tossing a complete game but piling up a career-high three hits.	"That was a blessing in disguise tonight," he said. "It's fun when you can hit and be a productive member of the lineup but it also helped out on a cold night to get out there and move around as opposed to just sitting in the dugout."	Collmenter pitched a four-hitter for the majors' first complete game this year to go with his big night at the plate, and the Arizona Diamondbacks sent the World Series champion San Francisco Giants to an eighth straight loss with a 9-0 win Friday night.	Jake Lamb hit a two-run triple in the third and Collmenter (1-2) added an RBI single as Arizona knocked Jake Peavy out of the game after only 3 2/3 innings. Paul Goldschmidt singled in a run for the Diamondbacks.	A.J. Pollock matched his career high with four hits for Arizona, including an RBI double. David Peralta doubled in a run among his three hits and Tuffy Gosewisch added an RBI single on a chilly Bay Area night.	The Giants' eight-game skid is their longest since June 13-22, 2007, in home run king Barry Bonds' final season. Their 3-9 record matches the worst start in San Francisco history. It was their third time being shut out, tied with the Pirates for most in the majors.	Collmenter struck out two and walked one in his second career shutout and complete game. He finished the 114-pitch gem by retiring Hector Sanchez on a broken-bat popup.	"It's fun when you have stuff working like that," Collmenter said. "For me the fastball command was huge for me and I was able to move the ball in and out. Everything for me plays off of that. The defense made a bunch of unbelievable plays."	The right-hander warmed up during the final inning of Arizona's 7-6 win in 12 on Thursday night, and if he had been used, the D-backs likely would have called up a pitcher from Triple-A Reno to start Friday. Collmenter is 3-0 with a 0.96 ERA in seven appearances and three starts at AT&T Park, with 19 straight scoreless innings. His three hits are already half of his 2014 total.	First-year Arizona manager Chip Hale joked about warming up Collmenter the night before next time.	"Maybe that's the new thing he's going to do every night," Hale joked.	Arizona's 18 hits are the most it has had against the Giants.	Hale considered batting Pollock in the No. 3 hole and Goldschmidt cleanup, but stuck with Pollock second followed by the slugging first baseman. It was a good call given the production they each delivered.	"Goldy's our No. 3 hitter and he'll be our No. 3 hitter," Hale said.	Goldschmidt turned an unassisted double play to end the fourth when Brandon Belt lined out to first and Goldschmidt then caught Casey McGehee off the bag.	Peavy (0-2) was tagged for four runs and eight hits in his second short outing so far, and this time his back tightened up. He lasted just four innings in a loss at San Diego on April 12. Peavy will be evaluated Saturday.	The beat-up Giants are counting down to their much-needed first off day of the season Monday before another tough stretch of nine in a row all against the division, starting with a three-game series at home against the defending NL West champion Dodgers before three games each at Colorado and Los Angeles.	"In general, these eight games, we haven't played well," manager Bruce Bochy said. "I wish we had a magic wand to fix it, but we don't so we have no choice but to come back and get after it tomorrow."	LINCECUM'S NEW `DO	Two-time NL Cy Young Award winner Tim Lincecum's new haircut is inspired by rocker Matt Healy, lead singer for the group "The 1975." Lincecum trimmed his shaggy `do by shaving the sides and keeping a long patch down the middle of the top and back. On the left temple area are three shaved lines.	"It's my third one in two years," he said. "Sometimes it's just easier to let it grow. I braved it, I rolled the dice."	Of being introduced in front of a cheering, sellout crowd for the home opener, he said: "It's still hair-raising ... no pun intended."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: With the bullpen taxed, Hale praised Collmenter for going the distance. RHP Randall Delgado was one pitcher Hale wanted to stay away from after he pitched the last two innings for the victory in Thursday's 7-6, 12-inning win.	Giants: New Giants 3B McGehee returned from a left knee injury to make his first home start and went 0 for 2 with a walk. ... 1B Travis Ishikawa, on the DL working back from a lower back injury, is encouraged with his progress in his rehab assignment with Triple-A Sacramento. He skipped the River Cats' road trip to attend Saturday's World Series ring ceremony.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: RHP Rubby De La Rosa (2-0) looks to mark the 21st time an Arizona starter has won his first three starts in a season.	Giants: RHP Chris Heston (1-1) takes a 0.69 ERA into his third start of the year. He beat the Diamondbacks for his first major league win April 8 at Chase Field.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.	Jhoulys Chacín has agreed to a guaranteed $1.25 million, one-year contract with the Rockies.	The Milwaukee Brewers acquired infielder Mike Brosseau from the Tampa Bay Rays for minor league pitcher Evan Reifert on Saturday in a trade between division winners.	After Mookie Betts rolls a 300 in the final qualifying round of the World Series of Bowling in Reno, Nevada, Betts discusses how his approach is similar in baseball.

WASHINGTON --  Runs have been hard to come by this week for the Philadelphia Phillies.	They got a big one courtesy Saturday of Ben Revere's speed.	Odubel Herrera had three hits and scored twice to back Aaron Harang, and the Phillies beat the Washington Nationals 5-3 Saturday to stop a six-game losing streak.	With the score 3-all in the seventh, Ryan Howard walked, Revere pinch ran and went home without the benefit of a hit.	"He got three bags on his speed," manager Ryne Sandberg said. "That was huge."	With Cameron Rupp facing Washington starter Jordan Zimmermann, Revere stole second.	"Everybody in the whole stadium knows I'm about to steal, so that's big," Revere said.	He sped to third when Rupp flied to Bryce Harper in right. With the infield in, pinch-hitter Grady Sizemore hit a hard bouncer to first and Revere, running on contact, beat Ryan Zimmerman's throw to the plate.	"Grady smoked that thing," Revere said. "I thought he lined out for a second and I kind of hesitated."	Freddy Galvis had two RBI singles for Philadelphia, which had scored 13 runs over its prior six games.	Harang (2-1) gave up three runs and seven hits in six innings, and Jonathan Papelbon pitched the ninth for his third save.	Harper hit a long home run for Washington, which had won three straight. Ian Desmond added three hits, but the shortstop continued to struggle in the field, committing an error and later dropping the ball while attempting to complete a double play in the same inning.	Zimmermann (1-2) allowed four runs -- two earned -- four hits and four walks in 6 1/3 innings.	"I was just trying to be too fine and then I ended up missing and falling behind," he said. "Then I would really make a mistake, and miss badly."	Harper tied it at 3 with his fourth homer, a fifth-inning drive that hit the top of the green wall well beyond the center-field fence.	Desmond's latest defensive troubles enabled the Phillies to take a 2-1 lead in the third. He bobbled Harang's one-out bouncer, and when Harang was ruled safe after a video review, Desmond had his eighth error in 12 games.	After Herrera's double, Galvis' single scored Harang and sent Herrera to third. Chase Utley then hit a potential inning-ending, double-play grounder to Dan Uggla, but Desmond, attempting to transfer the ball to his throwing hand for the relay, dropped it. Galvis was out at second, but Utley was safe at first and Herrera scored.	"Brutal," Desmond said of the drop.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: OF Domonic Brown (left Achilles tendinitis) continued his rehab, playing for Triple-A Lehigh Valley against Buffalo.	Nationals: SS Yunel Escobar, who left Friday night's game with a strained groin, was scheduled to have an MRI. ... OF Denard Span (core muscle surgery) worked out at Nationals Park and could be activated on Sunday.

DETROIT --  Despite their early season struggles, the players who make up the middle of the Chicago White Sox batting order knew what they could do.	They showed it on Saturday.	Jose Abreu hit a grand slam, Adam LaRoche added a three-run homer and four RBIs, and the White Sox beat the Detroit Tigers 12-3.	Chicago, which set a season high for runs, scored 11 runs in the third and fourth innings combined and collected a season-high 17 hits for the game. Abreu and LaRoche had three hits apiece, and Melky Cabrera matched a career high with four hits and knocked in two runs.	"Everybody knows what we are capable of doing. It was a good day for us," Abreu said through an interpreter. "I hope we can keep this momentum for the next one. Not saying that we can do again what we did today, but we can do damage."	Abreu came into the game hitting .206 with two home runs and two RBIs, LaRoche .179 with two homers and four RBIs and Melky Cabrera .162 with zeroes.	"I thought those guys proved how much they trust in having good at-bats, a lot of competitive at-bats today," White Sox manager Robin Ventura said. "Just some big at-bats in there with guys on base that added up to a pretty nice game."	J.D. Martinez homered for Detroit, which lost for the second time in 11 games this season.	The Tigers have only scored eight runs in their last four games. They won the previous three with a total of five runs.	"We did put it together early," Detroit manager Brad Ausmus said. "Really when you're going through offensive lows in terms of scoring runs like we have and you're still able to walk away with victories, I think that's a huge plus."	Chris Sale (2-0) cruised to the win, allowing two runs on four hits in six innings, walking one and striking out six. Zach Putnam pitched an inning and Kyle Drabek the final two.	"(That many runs) really takes the pressure off," Sale said. "You still have to go out there and go through it but it makes a difference."	Anibal Sanchez (1-2) gave up nine runs on nine hits in 3 1/3 innings.	Chicago scored four runs in the third to take a 4-1 lead.	The big blow was LaRoche's three-run homer, which broke a 1-all tie. LaRoche lined Sanchez's 2-1 pitch over the right-field fence, down the line, for his third home run.	The White Sox added seven more in the fourth to make it 11-1.	Abreu's second career grand slam, and third homer of the season, sent Sanchez to the showers and followed Melky Cabrera's run-scoring single. Conor Gillespie singled in a run and Alexei Ramirez's sacrifice fly completed the scoring in the inning.	Martinez led off the bottom of the fourth with his fifth home run for an 11-2 score.	Chicago added a run in the fifth on LaRoche's RBI double.	Nick Castellanos singled in a run for the Tigers in the eighth.	Detroit took a 1-0 lead in the first on Miguel Cabrera's one-out RBI single. Saturday was his 32nd birthday.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Detroit's Justin Verlander won't pick up a baseball until Sunday after he was more sore than expected two days after throwing 80 pitches. The veteran right-hander is on the disabled list with a right triceps strain. "It wasn't an injury setback, he's just more sore than what we expected," Ausmus said before Saturday's game.	UP NEXT	Right-hander Shane Greene (2-0) will be Detroit's starter in Sunday's series finale (1:08 p.m.) and rubber game. He hasn't allowed a run in 16 innings his first two starts as a Tiger and has only surrendered seven hits. Left-hander Jose Quintana (1-0, 4.09) will start for Chicago.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MINNEAPOLIS --  The Cleveland Indians have had to be patient with the progress of Danny Salazar.	His season debut gave them a nice little reward. The Minnesota Twins, meanwhile, were way too eager at the plate.	Salazar matched his career high with 10 strikeouts, giving the Indians a spark in a 4-2 victory over the Twins on Saturday.	"It's awesome," said Salazar, who struck out eight of his first 12 batters. "I have things to prove. I've been working."	Roberto Perez had a home run among his three hits for the Indians, and Jason Kipnis stopped an 0-for-16 slide with a two-out, RBI single in the seventh that prompted the Twins to pull starter Phil Hughes (0-3).	Kurt Suzuki led off the bottom half with a homer that cut Cleveland's lead to two runs, and manager Terry Francona then took out Salazar. Nick Hagadone retired all six batters he faced, and Cody Allen finished with a hitless ninth for his third save in as many attempts.	Minnesota, which had won three in a row, struck out 14 times.	Over 30 starts the last two seasons, Salazar totaled 185 strikeouts in 162 innings while bouncing between the Indians and Triple-A. The 25-year-old had a rough spring training, though, and the Indians decided to start him with Columbus. His first turn for the Clippers was a strong one, and a half-hour before his second scheduled start on Thursday he was scratched so the Indians could insert him in their rotation.	"First thing, you want to win the game," Francona said. "The next thing now is wanting him to follow it up."	Salazar frequently hit 96 mph on the stadium radar, sometimes 97 or 98, and had the Twins consistently off-kilter.	"We saw him a number of times last year, and he was a completely different pitcher," Minnesota's Brian Dozier said. "He threw everybody changeups, and to be honest he probably threw a handful of them last year. That's what he lived off of today."	Eduardo Nunez and Torii Hunter hit doubles in the third, but Suzuki grounded into an inning-ending double play in the fourth.	After Nunez singled in the fifth, he tried to steal but Jordan Schafer swung at the first pitch and hit a soft fly to left. Nunez was deked by the Indians infield and was almost halfway to third before realizing the ball was caught. He was easily out on another inning-ending double play.	Salazar, who pitched with seven days' of rest, gave up six hits and two walks.	"We all know it was there. He's a young guy with really good stuff," Allen said. "Hopefully that's what we see throughout the year."	Salazar credited Perez's work behind the plate for keeping him on pace and throwing the right pitches.	"Keep working on my routine. Try to do the same thing every time," Salazar said.	STRUGGLING SANTANA	Twins leadoff hitter Danny Santana had a particularly hard time with Salazar's heat, whiffing all three times he faced him. Santana is hitting .195 with one extra-base hit, 13 strikeouts and, glaringly, no walks.	SWINGING PEREZ	Perez had by far the longest hit of the day, when he led off the third by driving a 1-1 fastball from Hughes over the bullpens and into the second deck above left-center, an estimated 435 feet. Perez is 7 for 17 in four career games at Target Field.	TURTLING HUGHES	Hughes kept the Twins close until the seventh, when he gave up three singles in a four-batter span. Caleb Thielbar relieved and threw a wild pitch that let another run in. Hughes allowed eight hits and a walk while striking out three.	He hasn't pitched poorly, but his arm strength and pitch effectiveness aren't nearly where he'd like. This isn't unusual, either. He's 6-15 with a 6.05 ERA in 31 April starts.	"Maybe I need three extra weeks of spring training," Hughes said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: After missing six out of seven games because of a sore back before this series, Michael Brantley played left field for the first time after serving as the designated hitter the night before.	Twins: 3B Trevor Plouffe had his first game off after hitting the game-ending home run in the 11th inning the night before.	UP NEXT	With rain in the forecast, the Indians will send LHP T.J. House to the mound after a horrible first start last weekend against Detroit when he got only four outs and gave up six runs. RHP Trevor May will pitch for the Twins.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

The curtain call concept was new to him.	"A couple guys in the dugout said, `They want you to go back out there,"` Heyward said. "So I did. It was a good feeling."	Heyward's homer backed a strong six-inning pitching performance by Carlos Martinez as the Cardinals won their fourth in a row.	Matt Carpenter drove in a pair of runs for the NL Central champions.	Zack Cozart homered for the Reds, who have lost three in a row and six of seven.	Cincinnati speedster Billy Hamilton left in the eighth inning after beating out an infield single. He is day-to-day with irritation in his right groin, manager Bryan Price said.	Heyward was acquired from Atlanta in November to replace outfielder Oscar Taveras, who was killed in an automobile accident.	Heyward homered in his 42nd at-bat of the season, connecting in the third inning.	"He's a big boy with a big swing," said Carpenter, who had two hits. "Hopefully he's got a lot more homers left in there for us."	St. Louis manager Mike Matheny has final approval on all curtain calls.	"They usually look down towards my end of the dugout to see if it is appropriate or not," Matheny said.	Matheny gave the thumbs-up and the celebration was on.	Martinez (1-0) allowed one run and three hits, striking out four and walking two.	Trevor Rosenthal picked up his fourth save in as many opportunities. He struck out Joey Votto with two on to end the game.	Homer Bailey (0-1) surrendered five runs and nine hits over 5 2/3 innings. He made his first start after beginning the season on the disabled list while recovering from surgery on a torn flexor tendon.	"Early on, I felt I made some pretty good pitches that got hit," Bailey said. "They put some pretty good swings on them. But it does feel good to get back out there."	Martinez picked up his first win of the season and need just 86 pitches. He retired 10 of the last 11 batters he faced.	"I tried to limit my pitches so I could last longer," Martinez said. "It worked."	Carpenter, who has six successive multihit games, improved to 17 for 29 (.586) lifetime against Bailey. His two-run double in the sixth pushed the lead to 5-1 and chased Bailey.	Matt Adams put St. Louis in front with an RBI single in the first. He drove in Matt Holliday, who doubled with two out.	Holliday left the game after scoring with stiffness in his back. Holliday, who has hit safely in all 10 games this season, is day-to-day.	Yadier Molina made it 3-0 with a run-scoring double in the fourth. Molina has eight hits in his last 15 at-bats.	Cozart, who had three hits, pushed his hitting streak to seven games.	"We kept coming at them, we hit some balls hard," Price said. "But we weren't able to string together the big inning that we needed."	Jhonny Peralta of the Cardinals had a nine-game hitting streak snapped.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: Bailey came off the disabled list for the start. RHP Pedro Villarreal was optioned to Triple-A Louisville.	Cardinals: Announced after the game that OF Randal Grichuck will be put on the 15-day disabled list Sunday with a back strain. They will recall Dean Anna from Triple-A Memphis, who is expected to be ready for the game. ... LHP Jaime Garcia threw to hitters on Friday at extended spring training. General manager John Mozeliak indicated that Garcia is still about six weeks away from returning to the roster.	UP NEXT	Reds: RHP Mike Leake (0-0, 4.97) will make his 150th career appearance in the final game of the three-game series Sunday night. He has four career home runs and led NL pitchers in batting average in 2010 (.356) and 2012 (.305).	Cardinals: RHP Adam Wainwright (1-1, 2.08) will make his third start of the season. He has not allowed an earned run in his last 17 innings against the Reds.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CHICAGO -- On his second day with the Cubs, Kris Bryant played like the top prospect Chicago was expecting.	Bryant got a standing ovation for his first major league hit and reached base five times Saturday in a 7-6, 11-inning win over the San Diego Padres.	A day after Bryant went 0-for-4 with three strikeouts in his big league debut, he was 2-for-3 with a pair of singles and three walks.	"You're always looking for good at-bats and being a good decision-maker. He was that today," Cubs manager Joe Maddon said.	With the Cubs trailing 2-1 in the fifth, Bryant hit a broken-bat single off the end of his bat into short center to drive in the tying run, earning a big cheer from the 33,958 fans at Wrigley Field.	"We'll take it against a tough right-handed pitcher," Maddon said.	Bryant, who did not speak with reporters after the game, had allowed Wil Myers' bouncer leading off the game to kick off his glove for his first major league error.	"He made the one gaffe, but overall he played well, ran the bases good and he had a good baseball game today," Maddon said. "I think the fans, the folks who watch the game closely, they understand the importance of accepting your walks. You don't look for your walk; you accept your walk. And after yesterday it was ingrained in his mind that I'm not going to do that again."	Bryant walked against Tyson Ross in the first and fourth innings.	"He did a really good job. We know he's got talent. We just need to take a little bit of pressure off his shoulders," said Miguel Montero, who homered twice and drove in three runs. "He's a young kid, and he has all the talent in the world. He's going to be good."	Bryant walked in the seventh, flied out in the ninth and reached on an infield single to shortstop in the 11th against Craig Kimbrel (0-1), moving Anthony Rizzo to third with one out. Pinch-hitter David Ross walked to load the bases, bringing up Starlin Castro.	San Diego brought in Myers from center as a fifth infielder and, with all five playing in, Castro singled past third baseman Will Middlebrooks and into left field for the Cubs' second walk-off win of the season.	"This is one of the games that make us feel better," Castro said. "Last year and the year before, we lose a lot of games like that."	Chicago is over .500 through 10 games for the first time since 2009. The Cubs did not reach six wins until at least the 18th game in each of the past three seasons.	Zac Rosscup (1-0) allowed one hit in two scoreless innings for his second major league win.	Matt Kemp, who is batting .340 with nine RBIs, hit a two-run homer in the first off Kyle Hendricks, who allowed two runs and three hits in six innings with eight strikeouts and zero walks.	Ross gave up three runs, five hits and five walks in 5 2/3 innings, striking out nine	Trailing 6-2, San Diego tied the score in the ninth, which began with singles by Yonder Alonso and Kemp off Phil Coke.	Justin Upton greeted Hector Rondon with a run-scoring single, Middlebrooks hit an RBI double, Jedd Gyorko had a run-scoring groundout, and pinch-hitter Yangervis Solarte tied the score with a two-out single.	It was the third straight game that the Padres rallied to tie the game or take the lead.	"We feel as though until the game is over, we're still in it," San Diego manager Bud Black said. "Regardless of the score, it was tough to overcome with the wind blowing in and a four-run deficit, but that says a lot about our guys."	Rondon had converted 17 straight save opportunities since Aug. 5.	Montero's opposite-field home run to left through a 19 mph wind had given the Cubs a 3-2 lead in the sixth.	UP NEXT	Padres: Andrew Cashner (0-2, 4.09 ERA) is Sunday's scheduled starter. Cashner made his major league debut with the Cubs in 2010 and was traded to San Diego on Jan. 6, 2012, in exchange for Rizzo -- one of the first major transactions under president of baseball operations Theo Epstein.

BOSTON --  Chris Tillman couldn't wait to get back onto the mound after his shortest start in over three seasons.	Tillman (2-1) rebounded from a rough outing and helped lead the Baltimore Orioles over the Boston Red Sox 4-1 Saturday.	In his first start of the season, at home last Sunday, Tillman allowed seven runs in 2 2/3 innings in a 10-7 loss to Toronto.	"I wanted to get back out there. It felt like an eternity between starts," he said after giving up one run in 5 1/3 innings against Boston.	"After starts like that, it's not fun," he said. "You just want to get back out there and help the team."	Chris Davis hit a two-run homer, and Adam Jones had three singles for the Orioles, who moved back over .500 at 6-5.	Tillman's start against Toronto was his shortest since August 2011.	"I thought he had good stuff," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. "I think he was challenged by things out of his control."	Three Orioles pitchers combined for one-hit relief. Zach Britton threw a perfect ninth for his fourth save.	David Ortiz went 3 for 3 with a double and two singles for the Red Sox, who lost for the third time in their last nine games. Brock Holt had three singles.	Clay Buchholz (1-2) allowed two runs and 11 hits in six innings and is winless since beating Cole Hamels in Philadelphia on opening day. He gave up nine runs in 3 1/3 innings in a loss at Yankee Stadium last Sunday.	Buchholz labored through his innings, taking lengthy periods between pitches with runners on base.	"I went through a rough outing my last time out," he said. "I was more thinking pitch to pitch, get a ground ball, not give in -- I wasn't going to give in to anybody, regardless of bases being loaded or not. They're going to have to hit a good pitch."	With the Orioles leading 2-1 in the ninth, Davis hit an opposite-field off Robbie Ross Jr. into the first row of Green Monster seats in left field.	Manny Machado's run-scoring groundout and Caleb Joseph's RBI single put Baltimore ahead in the fourth. With the bases loaded and one out, Buchholz struck out Alejandro De Aza and Steve Pearce.	Baltimore loaded the bases with no outs in the fifth, but Machado bounced into a 3-2-3 double play and Ryan Flaherty struck out.	Boston closed in the sixth when Ortiz doubled and scored on Pablo Sandoval's slow roller down the first-base line.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: Baltimore placed 2B Jonathan Schoop on the 15-day DL before the game and recalled infielder Jimmy Parcedes from Double-A Bowie.	Red Sox: OF Shane Victorino was a late scratch with bruised ribs. He crashed into a wall in Friday's game, attempting to catch Joseph's homer while leaping at the short wall near the Pesky Pole. ... C Ryan Hanigan took a foul ball of his right (throwing) hand but stayed in the game.	PICK UP THE PACE	Buchholz took what seemed like a very long time between pitches with runners on.	When told the time of game -- 3 hours, 24 minutes -- Showalter just seemed perturbed.	"Why? Why? Tell me why. Why do you think it was?" he said.	GO THE OTHER WAY	Davis was happy he was able to hit a homer to left as he works through a slow start.	"I'm trying to stay on the ball as long as I can," he said. "I finally got in a favorable count, had a pitch and was able to drive it."	He was hitting .235 with just one homer and five RBIs coming in.	UP NEXT:	Orioles: Miguel Gonzalez (1-1, 1.42 ERA) starts Sunday. He pitched seven innings in his last start Tuesday, allowing one run over seven innings to beat the New York Yankees.	Red Sox: RHP Rick Porcello (1-1, 3.86) is slated make his second Fenway Park start for the Red Sox on Sunday. He pitched eight innings in the home opener on Monday, getting his first win in a Boston uniform.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

PITTSBURGH --  Pirates manager Clint Hurdle decided to give Starling Marte a day off earlier this week, trying to stop the left fielder's struggles at the plate. The move has paid off.	Marte homered for the second game in a row and drove in a career-high five runs to lead Pittsburgh over the slumping Milwaukee Brewers 6-2 Saturday night.	Marte hit a two-run single to cap a three-run first inning that included an RBI double by Gregory Polanco. Marte's three-run homer to left field in the fifth made it 6-1.	In the first two games of the series, Marte has gone 4 for 8 with seven RBIs. He was 0 for 11 with six strikeouts in his previous three games.	Marte got Tuesday off and he and Hurdle had a long conversation. The left fielder came back the next night and went 0 for 3 in a loss to the Detroit Tigers but Hurdle was encouraged that Marte saw 14 pitches in three plate appearances and felt he was ready for a breakout.	"In sports and in life, it becomes awfully frustrating if people don't what the expectations are of them," Hurdle said. "I try to make sure these guys know where they stand and know what I expect. It's never an average or a home run or an RBI that I'm looking for. It's the intangibles, and he's responded well."	Milwaukee lost its fourth straight game and is off to its worst start since also going 2-9 in 2002.	"We're trying to not worry about what's gone on in the past," Brewers manager Ron Roenicke said. "I think if we stay focused that way we're going to get through this easier."	Jeff Locke (2-0) tied a career-high by pitching eight innings while beating the Brewers for the second time in eight days. He allowed only one run and four hits while striking six with no walks.	Locke credits much of his early-season success to catcher Francisco Cervelli, acquired from the New York Yankees in an offseason trade. Cervelli has called for more fastballs.	"The fastball is the most common pitch and you have to throw it for strikes," Locke said. "You can't be scared to throw it and let the defense work behind you."	Kyle Lohse (0-3) has lost his first three starts of a season for the first time in his 15-year big league career. He was tagged for six runs and six hits in six innings.	"When you watch his bullpens he can do anything he wants to do," Roenicke said. "In games, he hasn't been the same."	Ryan Braun, batting leadoff for the first time in his career, and Jean Segura each had two of the Brewers' five hits. Jonathan Lucroy hit a sacrifice fly in the first inning and Khris Davis singled in a run in the ninth.	The Pirates have gone 4-1 against the Brewers this season and 1-5 against everyone else.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: RHP Charlie Morton (right hip surgery) threw 55 pitches in a simulated game Saturday at the extended spring training camp in Bradenton, Florida. He was supposed to pitch in a game against Yankees minor leaguers at Tampa, but it was called off.	UP NEXT	Milwaukee's Matt Garza (1-1) faces Gerrit Cole (1-0) on Sunday in the finale of the three-game series. Garza is 2-2 with a 3.92 ERA against Pittsburgh in eight career starts. Cole has won his last five decisions, dating to Sept. 1, and is 1-2 with a 3.27 ERA against the Brewers in five career starts.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Josh Reddick rounded the bases after his three-run homer, celebrated in Oakland's dugout for just a moment, and then climbed to the top step and waited.	He knew exactly what was coming next.	Royals pitcher Yordano Ventura promptly plunked A's third baseman Brett Lawrie with what appeared to be a retaliatory pitch for an incident the previous night, and Reddick and the rest of his teammates spilled onto the field in what could have turned into an ugly melee.	Cooler heads prevailed. So did the A's, who went on to beat Kansas City 5-0 Saturday night.	"We knew it was coming," Reddick said of the pitch that got Ventura ejected in the fourth inning. "It's bush league. There's no need for it."	Stephen Vogt and former Royals designated hitter Billy Butler also drove in a run for Oakland during the five-run fourth inning, and Jesse Hahn (1-1) scattered three hits and a walk over 5 1/3 innings before leaving with a blister on the middle finger of his pitching hand.	Jesse Chavez then picked him up with 3 2/3 innings for the save, completing the fifth shutout by Oakland in its first 12 games. The A's have outscored their opponents 47-1 in six victories.	"Never get tired of shutouts," Oakland manager Bob Melvin said.	Tempers were still hot from the series opener Friday night, when Lawrie slid hard and late into second base and wiped out Alcides Escobar. The Royals shortstop sprained his left knee in the collision, and said before Saturday night's game he thought the slide was dirty.	Ventura waited until he was pounded in the fourth before exacting some revenge.	After serving up Reddick's homer to right field, the hard-throwing youngster plunked Lawrie in the left elbow. Plate umpire Jim Joyce immediately tossed Ventura from the game, and the rest of the umpire crew moved quickly to prevent a more heated confrontation between the teams.	Lawrie calmly walked to first base and waited for the furor to die down.	"I didn't want to have any problems," said Lawrie, who apologized to Escobar in a text that apparently was not well received. "You can't control what happens on the other side."	When asked whether Ventura expected to be suspended, fellow pitcher Jeremy Guthrie -- serving as a translator -- replied: "I don't think we need to answer that."	The five-run fourth by Oakland and Ventura's ejection only made a miserable day worse for Kansas City. All-Star closer Greg Holland was placed on the 15-day disabled list prior to the game with a strained right pectoral muscle that has been bothering him for the last week.	Holland already has four saves, and has not allowed a hit in four scoreless innings.	Yohan Pino was recalled from Triple-A Omaha to take Holland's place on the roster. He threw 4 2/3 innings of three-hit ball after Ventura was tossed from the game.	"I thought Pino threw the ball great," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "He came in the fourth inning and got us through the eighth and gave us a nice chance to preserve the bullpen."	ACE DEPATURES	Ventura still has not left a game in what would be considered standard fare. He was forced out of his first start of the season with a cramp in his right thumb, and left his next start with a cramp in his right calf.	"Up until the ejection was able to stay in the game without having problems with the cramping," he said. "Those were the two things that were important for me."	BUTLER STREAKING	Kansas City might end up regretting its decision to decline a $12.5 million option on Butler for this season. His run-scoring single in the fourth extended his hit streak to 12 games, the first A's player with that long of a streak to begin their career with the organization.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: RHP Jarrod Parker (Tommy John surgery) threw 33 pitches in an extended spring game Saturday. He plans to go four innings his next time out, possibly in a minor league game.	Royals: Escobar remains day to day. Orlando Calixte was recalled from Omaha and OF Reymond Fuentes optioned to the same club to provide infield depth while Escobar is out.	UP NEXT	Athletics: LHP Scott Kazmir (2-0) has struck out eight or more batters in each of his first two starts. He allowed one run over six innings in a win Monday in Houston.	Royals: LHP Danny Duffy (1-0) is 3-0 with a 2.45 ERA in his career against Oakland.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

HOUSTON --  Dallas Keuchel had a sharp cutter and the Houston Astros felt loose.	Then George Springer provided the offensive spark.	Keuchel combined with three relievers on a three-hitter, and Springer and Robbie Grossman homered to lead the Astros over the Los Angeles Angels 4-0 Saturday night.	Springer's solo homer off C.J. Wilson (1-2) put the Astros ahead for good in the sixth, Springer's first home run this season.	"On that home run you get the lead, and the momentum comes in our way," Astros manager A.J. Hinch said.	Grossman hit a three-run drive off Mike Morin in the seventh.	"Those two home runs came at key moments after a good pitching performance with less than ideal stuff from Keuchel," Hinch said.	Keuchel (2-0) allowed two hits in six innings, struck out seven and walked three, throwing a season-high 105 pitches.	"That's a talented lineup there, and I was lucky to get out of there with six innings," Keuchel said.	Chad Qualls struck out the side in the seventh, Pat Neshek followed with a one-hit eighth and Luke Gregerson struck out his first two batters in a 1-2-3 ninth.	Angels batters struck out a season-high 13 times, and Los Angeles was unhappy with the strike zone of plate umpire Paul Nauert. Collin Cowgill was ejected after he was called out on strikes, ending the seventh.	"I was taking my shin guard off, and my shin guard got Velcro stuck to my pant leg," Cowgill said. "I tried to shake it off and it landed at his feet, and he threw me out of the game. It was an accident, 100 percent it was an accident. Did not mean to kick my shin guard at anyone."	Wilson gave up two runs, three hits and four walks in 6 2/3 innings with eight strikeouts. He didn't allow a hit until Jose Altuve's two-out single in the fifth.	"Sometimes you pitch well and somebody pitches a little bit better," Wilson said.	A night after hitting two home runs and driving in five runs, the Angels' Mike Trout went 0 for 4 with two strikeouts.	DOME CELEBRATION	The Astros commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Astrodome by donning their 1965 throwback jerseys. "They're different," Hinch said. "I like them." The Angels also went vintage with their 1965-70 road jerseys. Six members of the 1965 Astros were at the game: 3B Bob Aspromonte, C Ron Brand, RHP Bob Bruce, RHP Dan Coombs, RHP Larry Dierker and OF Jimmy Wynn. The grounds crew donned orange astronaut uniforms, complete with helmets and ushers dressed like the Spacettes from 50 years ago. Dubbed the Eighth Wonder of the World when it opened, the Astrodome hosted the Astros until 1999.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: Los Angeles plans to activate RHP Garrett Richards from the disabled list for Sunday's start. Richards, who had left knee surgery last August, had been on an injury rehabilitation assignment with Triple-A Salt Lake.	Astros: RHP Josh Fields (groin) impressed in his last outing with Triple-A Fresno, and manager A.J. Hinch said it was possible Fields could join the team during its upcoming three-city trip. "The report was that it was some of the best stuff that Fields has featured while on rehab," Hinch said. "His stuff was together and his changeup was really good.

NEW YORK -- Minus their closer in addition to their captain, the New York Mets kept rolling right along. Now, they're the only team in the majors undefeated at home.	Jacob deGrom pitched seven shutout innings, and New York got home runs from Travis d'Arnaud and Wilmer Flores to beat the slumping Miami Marlins 5-4 Saturday night for its seventh consecutive victory.	Juan Lagares and Eric Campbell each had an RBI single to help the Mets (9-3) open their home schedule with six wins in a row, equaling the club record set in 1985. The overall winning streak is New York's longest since an eight-game run in June 2010.	"We're all having a blast," d'Arnaud said. "Every day we show up to the park and it's instant jokes and laughing and just having fun."	The past four wins have come since captain David Wright went on the disabled list with a strained hamstring. The latest one was secured in a shaky ninth without closer Jeurys Familia.	New York's fast start has caught on quickly with fans of a team that's endured six consecutive losing seasons since moving into Citi Field. The attendance of 41,844 on Fireworks Night marked the Mets' second sellout -- and those two crowds over 40,000 matched last year's total.	All-Star ace Matt Harvey will be on the mound Sunday, when New York goes for a four-game sweep of its NL East rival.	"We feel like we've got that belief that we're going to win, and I think it starts with having confidence in that guy on the mound," Mets outfielder Michael Cuddyer said.	Dee Gordon went 5 for 5 with three RBIs for the Marlins, who lost their third straight and dropped to 3-9. They held a players-only meeting before batting practice in the wake of comments from Giancarlo Stanton that raised eyebrows the night before.	"We have a positive vibe but the fire is not there, it seems like," Stanton said.	The $325 million slugger was 0 for 4 with three strikeouts Saturday, yet Miami rallied for three runs in the ninth against Carlos Torres. Familia was rested after saving five games over the previous six days.	Michael Morse hit a leadoff homer, and Gordon's two-run single made it 5-4. Alex Torres, wearing his new padded cap to protect his head, struck out Christian Yelich with a runner aboard for his first major league save.	"It feels a little weird, but I didn't think about that," Torres said.	Yelich, who fanned four times, watched his bat slip out of his hands on his final swing and sail several feet beyond first base.	"It was great to see us come to life there at the end," Marlins manager Mike Redmond said. "Hopefully that will give us some momentum going into tomorrow."	Mat Latos (0-3) was much better in his third start for Miami, but was lifted for a pinch hitter down 2-0 in the sixth.	"When we put it all together," Latos said, "there's going to be hell to pay. We've got a great ballclub and I believe that."	On the other side, deGrom (2-1) struck out eight and walked none in his second consecutive spotless outing. The reigning NL Rookie of the Year extended his career-best scoreless streak to 18 1/3 innings with his 15th straight start of at least six innings.	The only major league pitcher with a longer current run is James Shields (16).	"He's not scared of any situation or any hitter, and he's got great stuff," Cuddyer said. "No moment's too big for him."	UNHITTABLE AT HOME	It was deGrom's first game against Miami since tying a big league record by whiffing the first eight Marlins batters last Sept. 15 at Citi Field. The right-hander is 7-0 with a 0.95 ERA in his past eight starts at Citi Field. He has struck out 64 and walked seven during that span.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: RHP Jose Fernandez (Tommy John surgery) was transferred to the 60-day DL when Miami claimed LHP Matt Tracy off waivers from the New York Yankees. Tracy will report to Triple-A New Orleans.	Mets: LHP Jerry Blevins also was unavailable due to a heavy workload lately, manager Terry Collins said. ... RHP Vic Black (shoulder tendinitis) was promoted to Double-A Binghamton on his rehab assignment and threw a scoreless inning against Harrisburg. ... Torres wears an MLB-approved padded cap when he pitches, and this year's new model arrived Saturday. The padding now wraps around the outside of the hat and sits on the brim in front, with a Velcro cinch in the back. Torres said it feels a bit different than the one he used with San Diego last season, when he was the only big league player to wear one.	UP NEXT	Marlins: Tom Koehler (1-1) estimated he might have about 50 fans on hand when he pitches Sunday. Koehler was born in the Bronx and went to New Rochelle High School nearby before attending Stony Brook University on Long Island.	Mets: Harvey tries to begin the season 3-0 in his return from Tommy John surgery. He is 0-1 with a 3.52 ERA in four starts against Miami. ... The Mets are 4-0 in day games.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Faced with questions about his elbow and his velocity this season, Masahiro Tanaka put together his best performance against the Tampa Bay Rays.	Tanaka allowed two hits over seven innings, Chris Young hit a grand slam and the New York Yankees routed the Rays 9-0 Saturday night.	"I thought he had all his pitches, which I think was the big difference," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.	Tanaka (2-1) struck out eight and walked none. He gave up a single to David DeJesus leading off the first, then retired 15 in a row before Brandon Guyer's double opening the sixth. After failing to reach the sixth inning in his first two starts, Tanaka lowered his ERA from 7.00 to 3.94.	"I'm happy with the results," Tanaka said through a translator. "I'm happy with the way I pitched. I think it's all about the mechanics. The mechanics was working well."	The Japanese star missed most of the second half of last season with a partially torn elbow ligament and had faced questions this spring about his decreased velocity. He reached 93 mph against the Rays.	"I really think it's important for him to see when I have my stuff, I'm going to pitch extremely well, and that's what he did," Girardi said.	This was the first time since joining the Yankees that Tanaka had a start of two hits or fewer while walking nine.	David Carpenter and Branden Pinder completed a three-hitter, the first shutout for the Yankees since Sept. 22 against Baltimore.	Young homered off Grant Balfour in a seven-run seventh, his third career slam.	"A good ballgame that turned somewhat ugly," Rays manager Kevin Cash said.	Brian McCann put the Yankees ahead in the sixth with his third hit, a two-run, two-out triple off Jake Odorizzi (2-1) that followed one-out walks to Brett Gardner and Alex Rodriguez. McCann's fourth career triple came in his 4,389th at-bat.	Odorizzi gave up three runs and five hits in six-plus innings. He was the third AL pitcher in the last 100 years to start the season by winning consecutive starts of six-plus innings, two hits or fewer and one run or less.	"He threw a great game," Odorizzi said of Tanaka. "If I gave up one or I gave up 10, it probably wouldn't have mattered tonight."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: Gardner (right wrist) was in the starting lineup for the first time since Monday. ... RF Carlos Beltran (cold) was scratched.	Rays: Evan Longoria (bruised left hip) started at third base after being the DH Friday. ... LHP Drew Smyly (left shoulder) is to start Sunday for Double-A Montgomery and should return this month. ... Closer Jake McGee (right elbow) could join Triple-A Durham Monday.	GREAT STARTS	The other two AL pitchers to start the season with consecutive winning starts of six-plus innings, two hits or less and one run or fewer in the last century are Texas' Alexi Ogando (2011) and Kansas City's Runelvys Hernandez (2003). Roger Clemens did in the NL with Houston in 2004.	MOVING DAY	Yankees: LHP Matt Tracy was claimed off waivers by Miami and RHP Joel De La Cruz was sent outright to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.	Rays: After the game, Balfour was designated for assignment and RHP Brandon Gomes had his contract selected from Durham.	UP NEXT	Yankees: In nine road starts with New York, Sunday starter Michael Pineda has 41 strikeouts and two walks over 43 innings. Tampa Bay got both walks last Sept. 16. ...  The Yankees can complete their first road sweep (three games or more) against the Rays since Sept. 13-15, 2005.	Rays: Longoria is 0 for 11 with two walks and four strikeouts against Pineda.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Chris Heston kept it simple and used the energy from the pregame ring ceremony to produce another quality start.	Heston pitched into the eighth inning, Brandon Crawford hit a two-run homer and the San Francisco Giants snapped an eight-game losing streak with a 4-1 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Saturday night.	Joe Panik had three hits and drove in a run as San Francisco stopped its longest slide in nearly nine years. Buster Posey went 2 for 4 with an RBI single on the same night that the Giants received their World Series rings for last year's title.	"It's awesome some of the days I've been lucky enough to pitch on," said Heston, who also started the Giants' home opener. "That will fire you up. It's a reminder of how good last year was. I just wanted to attack the bottom of the zone and let these guys play defense."	Nori Aoki also had two hits, including a leadoff double in the first that led to the Giants' first run and sent them on their way to their first win at home.	David Peralta led off the fourth with a home run for the Diamondbacks, who had won five of seven. Mark Trumbo had two hits.	Heston (2-1) allowed five hits in 7 2/3 innings. He struck out six and walked one.	"He's got savvy out there," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "He's a four-pitch guy with command. That usually works. I know he just pitched against them but he has good stuff and he's made himself into an all-around great pitcher."	Arizona right-hander Rubby De La Rosa (2-1) gave up four runs, three earned, and nine hits in 6 2/3 innings. He struck out seven and walked two.	"He just left too many pitches up," Arizona manager Chip Hale said. "When he was pitching down he had some success. He's getting better every time out."	Heston left after yielding an infield single to Jake Lamb, who has reached in all 10 of his games. Sergio Romo came on to strike out Paul Goldschmidt to end the inning.	Santiago Casilla pitched the ninth for his fourth save in four chances.	Arizona center fielder Ender Inciarte was 0 for 4, ending an eight-game hitting streak.	BENCH HELP	The Giants recalled catcher Andrew Susac from Triple-A Sacramento when Jake Peavy was placed on the disabled list.	"The bigger need right now is having another player help us out on the bench," manager Bruce Bochy said. "With a day off, we can skip a start and the bullpen is in good shape."	Susac and Hector Sanchez were in a close battle to make the big league squad out of spring training.	"It frees me up to pinch-hit Susac or Sanchez and not worry about leaving Posey out there," Bochy said. "He's another bat, another body. Susac will be in the mix."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: C Gerard Laird (lower back tightness) is eligible to come off the disabled list when Pittsburgh visits Phoenix on Friday.	Giants: Peavy is out with a back strain. He said he first felt it when the team flew home from Arizona following spring training. An MRI revealed a muscle spasm and some damage to the SI joint in his left side. "It's frustrating, of course," Peavy said. "At the end you have to make the right decision. It has to be right to help the team moving forward."	UP NEXT	RHP Jeremy Hellickson (0-2, 6.55 ERA) starts Sunday's series finale for the Diamondbacks. The 2011 AL Rookie of the Year has lost his first two starts with Arizona.	RHP Tim Hudson (0-1, 2.03 ERA) takes the mound for San Francisco. He is 9-1 with a 2.01 ERA in 13 career starts against the Diamondbacks.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

SEATTLE --  Knowing his ace had a sore quadriceps muscle and was nearing 100 pitches, six innings from Felix Hernandez was plenty for Seattle manager Lloyd McClendon.	Hernandez had other ideas and won the debate with his manager this time.	"I think it looks better, seven innings," Hernandez said with a grin.	Hernandez struck out 12 and Mike Zunino's first home run of the season gave Seattle the lead for good as the Mariners snapped a four-game losing streak with a 3-1 win over the Texas Rangers on Saturday.	Hernandez (2-0) was brilliant on his bobblehead night, allowing one run and two hits. The ace right-hander struck out 10 or more batters for the 34th time in his career and beat Texas for the first time since July 14, 2012.	Earlier in the week, Hernandez's sore quad raised concern that he might need to skip Saturday's start and get rest. In a way, the injury proved to be a benefit.	"My comfort level was fine. I think it helped me to stay back a little bit and not to push too much and not to jump too much," Hernandez said.	Zunino's homer came after a miserable first 10 games when he struck out in nearly half his at-bats. Zunino's drive went 412 feet into the second deck in left on the first pitch of the fifth inning from Colby Lewis (1-1) and gave Seattle a 2-1 lead.	"He is an ambush hitter," Lewis said. "I just didn't make my pitch."	Brad Miller added a two-out RBI triple in the sixth as Seattle finally came through with a runner in scoring position and two outs.	The Mariners left the bases loaded twice and ran themselves out of scoring opportunities in each of the first three innings.	Austin Jackson was sent by third base coach Rich Donnelly while trying to score from first on Robinson Cano's one-out double in the first and was thrown out at the plate by 10 feet. Kyle Seager attempted a delayed steal of second on a ball in the dirt in the second inning and was easily thrown out. And Miller was picked off second base by catcher Robinson Chirinos with one out in the third.	"Felix did a great job of keeping us in that ballgame so any runs that we can get in a game like that are huge so just to be able to do that was nice," Zunino said.	Ultimately the baserunning issues didn't matter because of Hernandez's pitching. Leonys Martin was the only Texas batter to get a hit off Hernandez, reaching on a broken-bat double in the first and singling in the fifth inning when Texas got its only run.	Hernandez's 12 strikeouts were his most since recording 15 against Tampa Bay in June 2014. Martin was the only Texas batter not to strike out.	The only mistake Hernandez made was hitting Jake Smolinski on the hand on a check swing in the fifth. The play was reviewed, with Seattle claiming it was a foul ball, but the call stood. Smolinski advanced to third on Martin's single and scored on Elvis Andrus' grounder.	It was the second batter Hernandez hit, although he is certain he hit only one.	"There was only one. The other was a foul ball," Hernandez said.	RODNEY EXPRESS	Struggling closer Fernando Rodney worked a perfect ninth for his third save in four chances. Rodney needed just 14 pitches to roll through the middle of the Rangers' order after blowing a save his last time out against the Dodgers.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: Mitch Moreland was out of the lineup again with an elbow injury.  Moreland went through early batting practice but was not in the Rangers lineup for the second straight night.	Mariners: Seattle activated SS Chris Taylor from the 15-day disabled list and optioned him to Triple-A Tacoma. Taylor had been playing with Tacoma as part of a rehab assignment after fracturing a bone in his right wrist during spring training.	UP NEXT	Rangers: Left-handed Ross Detwiler (0-2) will make his third start after getting knocked around in his first two. Detwiler has allowed five earned runs in both of his outings this season.	Mariners: Lefty James Paxton (0-1) gets his third start. Paxton has gone at least six innings in his first two starts of the season, but allowed five earned runs in his last outing against the Dodgers.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

LOS ANGELES --  Zack Greinke has earned Don Mattingly's confidence during his time with the Los Angeles Dodgers. So when he got a visit from his manager in the seventh inning after throwing 91 pitches, the right-hander convinced him to let him stay in the game.	After striking out Nick Hundley, Greinke gave up a two-run homer to DJ LeMahieu and was done for the night. But the bullpen held Colorado in check the rest of the way for a 6-3 victory, helping Greinke to his fourth straight win against the Rockies.	"I think that may be his first home run on a fastball against a right-handed pitcher in his career," Greinke said. "He's hit some of them on off-speed pitches, so I was just trying to throw a fastball away and he hit it pretty well. I wasn't really thinking home run at the time I threw it, but I had a decent lead and I just wanted to make him put the ball in play."	LeMahieu's first homer of the season came on Greinke's 103rd and final pitch. It also was his first in 53 career at-bats at Dodger Stadium.	"I knew I was probably his last batter, so I didn't want him leaving on a good note," said LeMahieu, who is batting .463 through his first 11 games. "I'm just seeing the ball well. I had a good first series and I've just tried to carry it on."	Adrian Gonzalez drove in three runs for Los Angeles, which finished with nine hits.	Greinke (2-0) allowed three runs and five hits in 6 2/3 innings while improving to 20-1 with a 1.95 ERA in 30 starts against NL West teams since signing with the Dodgers in December 2012.	"That's probably the toughest lineup in the National League. Maybe our lineup is up with theirs, but they're pretty good," Greinke said. "I mean, Corey Dickerson is about as good as anyone in baseball who is batting sixth, and LeMahieu is batting close to .500 right now -- and he's their eighth hitter. That's pretty tough."	Gonzalez, who led the majors last season with 116 RBIs, has 14 in his first 11 games and is batting .523 (23 for 44).	"That's pretty amazing," Greinke said. "He went through a little slump last year, and that's the first time I think I've seen him go through one since I've been here. But right now, he's as hot as it gets."	Joel Peralta pitched a hitless ninth for his third save in three chances.	Jordan Lyles (1-1) gave up four runs, five hits and five walks in six innings, dropping to 0-3 with a 6.84 ERA in four starts against the Dodgers.	"It's the walks, and a lot of them scored," Lyles said. "If they're going to score, make them earn it. After I walked them, they earned it by getting them in. I've got to do a better job of attacking them early."	Lyles walked three of his first four batters in the fifth, including Yasiel Puig, who stared down the right-hander after a belt-high wild pitch that just missed hitting the slugger. Puig sat out the previous three games because of tightness in his left hamstring.	Troy Tulowitzki's run-scoring single put Colorado ahead in the first, but Yasmani Grandal's RBI single tied the score in the second.	After the Dodgers loaded the bases with one out in the third, Gonzalez hit what appeared to be a double-play grounder to Tulowitzki at shortstop. But LeMahieu's relay throw in the dirt couldn't be handled by first baseman Justin Morneau, and Greinke scored the go-ahead run.	"We turn that double play 99 out of a 100 times," LeMahieu said. "We've got to play good clean baseball to win on the road. It would have helped a lot if we could have gotten out of that inning."	WILD MAN	Greinke, who threw a career-high 12 wild pitches last season, made two in a row in the third inning.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: LF Carl Crawford did not play because of a stomach ailment and was replaced by Andre Ethier, who started the previous three games in RF while Puig was sidelined. Ethier had not started in four consecutive games since June 28-July 2 last year. ... Closer Kenley Jansen threw off a mound for the first time since left foot surgery in February. His bullpen session lasted 15 pitches.	UP NEXT	Rockies: RHP Eddie Butler will make his sixth career start and third against the Dodgers, the team he made his big league debut against last June 6 at Coors Field. Last Monday, he pitched 5 1/3 scoreless innings despite giving up six walks.	Dodgers: RHP Brandon McCarthy surrendered four home runs while striking out 10 and walking none in a seven-inning no-decision last Monday against Seattle at Dodger Stadium. The 10-year veteran, who played high school ball in Colorado Springs, is 0-2 with a 6.75 ERA in four career starts against the Rockies.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

TORONTO --  Atlanta's Shelby Miller has added to his arsenal since shutting out the Blue Jays last season.	He didn't blank them again Sunday, but he did beat them again.	Jonny Gomes drove in four runs to back Miller (2-0), and the Atlanta Braves defeated the Toronto Blue Jays 5-2.	"He did a nice job, gave us the innings we needed," Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez said of Miller.	Miller pitched a three-hit shutout against Toronto for St. Louis last June, his only prior start against Toronto.	"I was kind of a little bit of a different pitcher then," Miller said. "I didn't have the cutter or the sinker that much."	The cutter, a pitch he has focused on refining this season, featured more prominently.	"It's more of a feel, pitch, a confidence pitch," Miller said. "You've just got to have confidence in it and throw it and let it do what it does. That's a pitch that'll help but it's still got a lot of room to grow."	This time, Miller kept the Blue Jays scoreless through five before Russell Martin's two-out, two-run double in the sixth. Miller gave up two runs and five hits in six innings, raising his ERA from 0.90 to 1.69.	"You'll take both of those outings against the Blue Jays at home," Miller said. "You're coming into their home field, where they hit great. Coming out with a win is a positive thing."	Andrew McKirahan got two outs in the seventh, Cody Martin pitched 1 1/3 innings, and Jason Grilli finished to remain perfect in six save chances.	Gomes hit a three-run double in the first off rookie Daniel Norris (1-1) and added a sacrifice fly in the third as the Braves took two of three from Toronto.	"That's what he gets paid for, is to hit left-handers," Gonzalez said.	Toronto has lost five of the first seven games on its opening homestand.	Gomes' two-out, bases-loaded double in the first ticked off the glove of rookie center fielder Dalton Pompey, who fell down on the play and appeared to have trouble tracking the ball.	Pompey acknowledged he has been "playing somewhat scared" all season out of fear of making a mistake.	"We lose that game because I don't make that play, and I take full responsibility for that," Pompey said.	Pompey was guilty of another mistake as Atlanta made it 5-0 in the third. Freddie Freeman walked, Chris Johnson singled to center and Freeman scored on Pompey's throwing error. Johnson took third on the throw and scored on Gomes' fly ball to left.	Norris allowed all five runs -- four earned -- and six hits in 2 2/3 innings.	"I'm going through a little bit of a dead arm phase," Norris said.	DYNAMIC DUO	Freeman and Nick Markakis combined to go 12 for 20 in the three-game series, scoring nine of Atlanta's 18 runs. "That's what we need from those guys," Gonzalez said. "That's why they hit three and four."	WALK THIS WAY	Toronto's Jose Bautista drew his 10th and 11th walks of the season, passing Tampa Bay's Evan Longoria (9) for the AL lead. New York Mets outfielder Curtis Granderson (12) is the major league leader.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: Rookie 2B Devon Travis left in the first inning after being hit in the left ribs by a pitch, then aggravating the injury when he went back to first base on a pickoff attempt. X-rays were negative. Steve Tolleson replaced Travis. Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said he hoped Travis would be able to return after Monday's off day.	UP NEXT	Braves: Atlanta is off Monday before a three-game series in New York starting on Tuesday against the Mets. Braves RHP Trevor Cahill faces LHP Jon Niese (1-0) in the opener. Cahill is 0-1 with a 4.00 in two career starts against the Mets.	Blue Jays: Toronto is off Monday before opening a three-game series against Baltimore. Blue Jays LHP Mark Buehrle (2-0) faces RHP Bud Norris (0-1) in the opener. Buehrle beat Baltimore on April 10 for his 200th win.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

DETROIT --  Yoenis Cespedes has added a bit more power to Detroit's lineup, and the guy who hits after him has taken notice.	"Kind of a tough act to follow," Nick Castellanos said. "You touch him, he's all muscle. It's ridiculous how strong that guy is."	Cespedes hit a grand slam and a two-run homer and Shane Greene pitched seven impressive innings in another fine start to begin the season, helping the Tigers rout the Chicago White Sox 9-1 on Sunday.	It was the first major league grand slam for Cespedes, and both his home runs came off Jose Quintana. Cespedes is now 6 for 8 with four home runs against Quintana (1-1) for his career.	"Any ballplayer that hits two home runs is feeling good," Cespedes said through a translator. "I couldn't be luckier to be on such a great team with such a good group of ballplayers."	Greene (3-0) allowed his first earned run of the season Sunday when an RBI triple by Jose Abreu skipped past J.D. Martinez in right field in the sixth. Greene gave up five hits and four walks, but the White Sox hit into four double plays.	Greene, who was traded in the offseason from the New York Yankees to Detroit, struck out three.	Cespedes came up with two out and the bases loaded in the first. As a wind-whipped rain began to fall, the Detroit slugger sent a drive over the fence in left to make it 4-0.	The weather cleared up nicely after that, but Quintana's problems were only beginning. James McCann led off the bottom of the second with a triple and scored on a single by Rajai Davis.	"It's a bad day, I forget that and keep working hard every time," Quintana said. "I have confidence in me every time we go out there. The next start, make the adjustment and do better."	Cespedes hit his second homer of the game in the third to give the Tigers a 7-0 lead. It was the third homer of the season and 74th career shot for Cespedes, who has won the All-Star Home Run Derby the last two years.	Victor Martinez added an RBI double in the fifth to chase Quintana, and Castellanos hit a run-scoring double of his own later that inning.	The Tigers (10-2) are off to the best start of any team in baseball, and the defending AL Central champions rebounded from a 12-3 loss to the White Sox on Saturday. Detroit leads the division by one game over Kansas City, which has the American League's second-best record.	Victor Martinez had three hits and three runs for the Tigers before being lifted for a pinch-hitter in the seventh.	SOLID AGAIN	Greene has been a strong addition so far in a starting rotation that lost Max Scherzer to free agency and Rick Porcello via a trade. He allowed an unearned run in his first start against Minnesota, then went eight scoreless innings at Pittsburgh.	The walks could have been a problem against the White Sox, but Chicago never put together a big rally.	"I was doing my best to throw strikes. When I wasn't throwing strikes and I was putting guys on base, the defense was turning two," Greene said. "They make it a lot easier when they're doing that."	ROUGH OUTING	Chicago's pitchers came into the game with a 1.79 ERA in their previous 50 1/3 innings, but Quintana was in trouble pretty much throughout. He allowed nine runs and 10 hits in four-plus innings.	"It seemed like he was getting ahead 0-2 or 1-2 on almost every hitter, but then he would start nibbling instead of going after them," manager Robin Ventura said. "He kept ending up 3-2 and then he'd come in with a pitch that would catch too much of the plate. Q's going to be better than this -- I'm not worried about him."	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox: RHP Jake Petricka (right forearm) is on a rehab assignment with Triple-A Charlotte. He pitched a scoreless inning Saturday night against Gwinnett.	Tigers: Manager Brad Ausmus said reliever Joe Nathan (right elbow) will need to pitch on a rehab assignment or in a simulated game before returning for the Tigers. He is eligible to come back Wednesday from the DL.	UP NEXT	White Sox: Chicago LHP John Danks (0-2) takes on Cleveland in the opener of a three-game series on Monday night. Trevor Bauer (1-0) is expected to start for the Indians.	Tigers: Detroit sends RHP Alfredo Simon (2-0) to the mound Monday night against New York Yankees LHP CC Sabathia (0-2). New York is at Detroit for a four-game set.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK -- Travis d'Arnaud had his right hand in a blue cast. Jerry Blevins' left arm was in a sling. About the only thing not broken Sunday at Citi Field was the New York Mets' winning streak.	Matt Harvey won his third straight start to begin his comeback season and the banged-up Mets, despite losing two important players to injuries, held off the Miami Marlins 7-6 for their eighth consecutive victory.	"It's really unfortunate," Harvey said. "We're playing such good baseball right now. The last thing you want to happen is something like that."	Ruben Tejada had a three-run double and d'Arnaud singled twice in a seven-run fourth inning. But it was a costly win for the Mets, who lost their catcher to a broken hand and a key reliever to a fractured forearm.	Blevins took a line drive off his pitching arm, and d'Arnaud was hit by a pitch.	"It's not a good day," manager Terry Collins said. "It's a good day we won and we'll take that away, but a tough day for us."	After the Marlins trimmed a six-run deficit to one, Jeurys Familia retired Christian Yelich and Giancarlo Stanton on grounders with a runner at second for his sixth save.	Already missing captain David Wright (hamstring) and right-hander Zack Wheeler (elbow surgery), the Mets matched the best start in franchise history at 10-3. They won their first seven home games for the first time and completed their first four-game sweep since July 2011 in Cincinnati.	"It's a bittersweet day, I guess. We're playing so well, and the two guys that got hurt were playing awesome," said Eric Campbell, who has been filling in nicely for Wright at third base.	The winning streak is the club's longest since an eight-game run in June 2010. New York also opened 10-3 in 1986 and 2006 -- and won division titles both times.	Harvey (3-0) has been sick lately but said he didn't want to give up a start. Handed a 7-1 lead, he tired and was chased with none out in the seventh.	"I can't swallow anything. Just felt weak, rundown," he said.	The ace, coming off Tommy John surgery that sidelined him last season, yielded four runs and eight hits. But he threw 63 of 84 pitches for strikes while whiffing seven and walking none. He has struck out 24 and issued one free pass.	"It was a battle," Harvey said. "I think I kind of ran out of gas."	The first three innings could not have gone any better for Marlins starter Tom Koehler (1-2). Pitching close to home with family and friends in the stands, he retired his first nine batters and even singled off Harvey.	The fourth inning could not have gone much worse.	Koehler loaded the bases with none out and gave up RBI singles to Daniel Murphy and Juan Lagares. Kirk Nieuwenhuis drew a four-pitch walk to force in another run before Tejada, the No. 8 batter, drove a bases-clearing double to deep left-center.	"Extremely disappointing, just hanging the bullpen out to dry," Koehler said.	The Mets made it 7-1 with d'Arnaud's run-scoring single off Sam Dyson. New York sent 12 hitters to the plate in its biggest inning since a seven-run seventh against Arizona on July 2, 2013.	"That's the second time this year that we've given up seven runs in an inning. It's tough to win ballgames like that," Marlins manager Mike Redmond said. "Needed a deep start out of Tommy and it was looking good there for three innings and then it just snowballed on him."	TRAINER'S ROOM	More bad news for the Mets: RHP Vic Black (shoulder tendinitis) complained of soreness in his shoulder and neck while on a minor league rehab assignment and will be examined again. "There's an issue there," general manager Sandy Alderson said. ... Blevins exited after he was struck on the left forearm by Dee Gordon's liner. The left-hander scooped up the ball and flipped it to first base with his glove for an out. Left-handed batters are 0 for 14 this season against Blevins, acquired from Washington a week before opening day. "It's a pretty big letdown," he said. ... In the seventh, d'Arnaud was hit by a pitch from A.J. Ramos on the right hand. The catcher was replaced by backup Anthony Recker. "Just got to keep my head up and cheer my teammates on," d'Arnaud said.	THE REPLACEMENTS	Alderson said catcher Kevin Plawecki, a prized prospect, and right-hander Hansel Robles will be called up from Triple-A Las Vegas to help fill in. Blevins and d'Arnaud are headed to the disabled list, and it's unclear how long they'll be out. Both are scheduled to be examined by a specialist Monday.	UP NEXT	Marlins: A day off Monday, followed by a three-game series in Philadelphia. RHP Dan Haren (1-0, 2.08 ERA) starts the opener Tuesday night against RHP Jerome Williams.	Mets: After a day off, the Mets welcome Atlanta to Citi Field for the final three games of a 10-game homestand. LHP Jonathon Niese (1-0, 1.59 ERA) faces RHP Trevor Cahill on Tuesday night.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  The New York Yankees completed their best trip to Tampa Bay in a decade with their first sweep this season.	Chase Headley and Mark Teixeira drove in two runs each, and the Yankees beat the Rays 5-3 Sunday to complete a three-game sweep.	"You make up a little bit for the slow start," Headley said. "We didn't play well, really, in any facet the first couple series."	New York (6-6) reached .500 for the first time since it was 1-1. The Yankees swept a series of three or more games at Tampa Bay for the first time since Sept. 13-15, 2005.	Headley had an RBI single off Matt Andriese (0-1) in a two-run third to help the Yankees go ahead 3-2. He made it 5-2 with an RBI double in the fifth.	Teixeira hit a first-inning sacrifice fly and run-scoring grounder in the third, and John Ryan Murphy had a sacrifice fly in the fourth.	Alex Rodriguez doubled, walked twice and scored twice. Rodriguez, who leads the team with a .316 average, four homers and 11 RBIs, also hit a broken-bat fly that was caught just in front of the left field warning track.	Michael Pineda (2-0) allowed three runs and seven hits in 5 2/3 innings. After Ryan Brett doubled leading off the ninth for his first big league hit, Andrew Miller struck out three straight batters for his fourth save.	"It feels good," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "You're getting contributions up and down the lineup. The bullpen came in and did a really good job. Got some good starting pitching. Those are the things you need to be consistent."	Steven Souza Jr. homered and drove in three runs for the Rays.	"It's just a bump in the road," Souza said.	David DeJesus drew a rare road walk from Pineda leading off the first and scored on Souza's homer for a 2-1 lead. In 10 road starts with the Yankees, Pineda has walked three in 48 2/3 innings.	Souza cut the Rays' deficit to 5-3 with an RBI double in the fifth.	Andriese gave up four runs and eight hits in 3 1/3 innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: RF Carlos Beltran (cold) was out of the lineup for the second straight game. He might start Monday night at Detroit.	Rays: LHP Drew Smyly, who could return this month from left shoulder tendinitis, gave up one hit and three walks with four strikeouts in 3 2/3 scoreless innings for Double-A Montgomery.	MORE A-ROD	Rodriguez reached base on eight of 14 plate appearances during the series. He went 4 for 10 with two homers, four RBIs, four walks and scored six times. The only Yankees' player to score six times in a three-game series last season was Brett Gardner July 28-30 at Texas.	TANAKA TIME	RHP Masahiro Tanaka made just the 10th start Saturday night by a Yankees pitcher since 1914 with at least seven scoreless innings, two-hits-or-fewer, no walks and at least eight strikeouts. It was the first one by a Yankees pitcher since Randy Johnson on July 26, 2005.	LONGO'S LONG DAYS	Rays slugger Evan Longoria was hitless in three at-bats and is 0 for 14 overall against Pineda. All three at-bats Sunday came with runners on base.	UP NEXT	Yankees: LHP CC Sabathia (0-2, 5.68 ERA) looks for his first win since April 24 last year against Boston when he starts Monday. He made just eight starts last season due to a right knee injury that required surgery in July.	Rays: RHP Chris Archer (2-1, 1.37 ERA) will try to extend his 14-inning scoreless streak when he faces Boston on Tuesday night. He is 1-4 with a 6.03 ERA in seven starts against the Red Sox.

BOSTON --  The Baltimore Orioles lost a couple of quality hitters to free agency during the offseason.	It won't matter much if Adam Jones keeps up this pace.	Jones went 4 for 5 with a three-run double and two-run homer to match his career high with five RBIs, carrying the Orioles past the Boston Red Sox 8-3 on Sunday.	"I think Adam welcomes the responsibility of being a guy that his teammates and his organization count on," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. "I don't think that ever changes for him."	During the offseason, the defending AL East champs lost Nick Markakis to Atlanta and Nelson Cruz signed with Seattle.	"They're still going to pitch me the same way. I've just got to try and get a fastball and not miss it," Jones said. "They're not going to pitch me any different because of the personnel. They're going to pitch me because of the way they have seen me hit."	Jones raised his average to .457 with five homers and 16 RBIs, and also equaled his career best with the four hits.	"Right now they've probably got the hottest hitter in all of baseball going for them, in Jones, and we've got to slow them down," Boston manager John Farrell said.	Ryan Flaherty added a solo homer and Jimmy Paredes three singles for the Orioles, who won for the second straight day after losing the series opener.	Hanley Ramirez hit a three-run homer and two hits for Boston, which needs to win Monday's annual Patriots' Day game to avoid losing its first series.	Miguel Gonzalez (2-1) pitched five innings for the victory, allowing three runs and five hits.	"I think what got me to that (point of the game) was our offense," Gonzalez said. "We know that Jonesie is hitting the ball really well. Paredes came up and he's hitting the ball well."	Rick Porcello (1-2) allowed eight runs and 12 hits -- with two homers -- in five innings.	"I left a lot of fastballs out over the plate," Porcello said. "Obviously Adam Jones was a good example of that. Just didn't pitch my game."	Boston DH David Ortiz was ejected by home plate umpire John Tumpane, who replaced original plate ump Paul Emmel.	The Orioles broke a 3-3 tie in the fifth. Travis Snider had an RBI single and Manny Machado a sacrifice fly.	Jones' three-run double off the left-center field wall chased Porcello and made it 8-3 in the sixth.	Trailing 2-0, Boston jumped ahead on Ramirez's homer that caromed off a billboard above the Green Monster seats and onto the field. Flaherty's home run tied it at 3-3.	Jones' homer went completely out of Fenway Park, clearing the Monster seats, in the first.	YOU'RE OUT	Emmel left the game in the middle of the fourth inning, walking slowly to Boston's dugout where he chatted with a member of the medical staff before heading down the steps. There was no announcement why he left.	Second-base ump Tumpane moved behind the plate.	The crew also had a change before the game when Jordan Baker was replaced by Tumpane. Baker ejected Baltimore right-hander Ubaldo Jimenez for hitting Pablo Sandoval on Friday.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: Their lineup looks a lot different due to players being on the disabled list. 2B Jonathan Schoop (strained right knee), SS J.J. Hardy (strained left shoulder), C Matt Wieters (right elbow reconstructive surgery) are out.	Red Sox: 2B Dustin Pedroia was rested on Sunday after going 0 for 4 with two strikeouts in Saturday's loss. Brock Holt (11 for 19 coming into the game) started in his place and batted leadoff. He went 1 for 5.	UP NEXT:	Orioles: Wei-Yen Chen (0-0, 4.35 ERA) is scheduled to start the series finale. In his previous start in Fenway, on Sept. 10, the left-hander had a no-hitter broken up with two outs in the sixth inning.	Red Sox: RHP Justin Masterson (1-0, 7.59) is slated to go for the Red Sox in the annual Patriots' Day game with a scheduled 11:05 a.m. first pitch. He was chased in the fifth inning of his previous start, on Tuesday against Washington, when he gave up seven runs in 4 2/3 innings.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

WASHINGTON --  With Stephen Strasburg's dominating performance and Denard Span's return to the lineup, the Washington Nationals are feeling better about themselves.	Strasburg allowed a run in 7 1/3 innings and Span returned from the disabled list to spark a three-run fifth inning that helped Washington to a 4-1 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Sunday.	"No offense to anybody, but it was normal, more normal today," Nationals manager Matt Williams said.	Strasburg (1-1) struck out seven, walked two and allowed five hits in his best start of the season as the Nationals took three of four from the Phillies for their first series win.	The right-hander had allowed 11 runs -- eight earned -- in his previous two starts, but took a no-hitter into the fifth inning Sunday with improved offspeed pitches.	"I think it's just the command of my changeup and the feel for my changeup was much better," Strasburg said.	Added Williams: "That may be as good as I've seen him."	Span singled and scored from first on Ian Desmond's double, sparking a two-out rally against Phillies starter David Buchanan (0-3).	"I was out of breath," joked Span of the sprint, coming in his first game back following surgery in March to fix a core muscle. "But it felt good to just get on my horses like that."	Jayson Werth singled in another run and then scored on Ryan Zimmerman's bloop double off Buchanan, who allowed three runs and six hits, three walks and struck out four.	"I made some good pitches, just had some tough luck on some hits ... and that fly ball to Zimmerman, you just can't do anything about that," Buchanan said.	Drew Storen worked the ninth for his fourth save, sending the Phillies to their seventh loss in eight games.	Philadelphia has scored only 32 runs through 13 games, but most hitters would've struggled against Strasburg on Sunday.	He required only 21 pitches -- 18 strikes -- to make it through the first three innings.	"You want them to put the ball in play in four pitches or less, and they were doing that," Strasburg said.	Then in the fifth, he struck out Jeff Francoeur on a curveball and Ryan Howard on a changeup before Carlos Ruiz looped a single to left to end the no-hit bid.	The Nationals added a fourth run in the seventh on Zimmerman's single. Strasburg was chased in the eighth after Odubel Herrera doubled and scored.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: OF Domonic Brown (left Achilles tendinitis) is 0 for 8 in two games with Triple-A Lehigh Valley after beginning his rehab assignment with Class A Clearwater. Brown started in right and batted third Sunday, going 0 for 4 with a walk and a run scored.	Nationals: IF Yunel Escobar (groin strain) was out of the starting lineup for a second day after leaving Friday night's game early. ... Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo said 3B Anthony Rendon (left MCL sprain) and RHP Casey Janssen (right shoulder tendinitis) are progressing in their rehabs, but did not provide a timetable for either player's return.	ESPINOSA'S DEFENSE	With Escobar out, Nationals IF Danny Espinosa made a pair of fine plays in his second career start at third base. First he charged a bunt by Cesar Hernandez and threw him out by half a step in the third. Then made an over-the-shoulder sliding grab of Freddy Galvis' foul pop-up in the fourth.	HOWARD MOVES UP IN LINEUP	Manager Ryne Sandberg moved Phillies 1B Ryan Howard up to the fifth spot in the order Sunday after dropping him to seventh in the first three games of the series. In the series, Howard went 3 for 13 with an RBI to raise his average to .175.	UP NEXT	Phillies: RHP Jerome Williams (0-1, 4.09) starts as Philadelphia begins a six-game homestand Tuesday with the first of three against the Miami Marlins.	Nationals: LHP Gio Gonzalez (1-1, 5.11) looks to continue his success against the St. Louis Cardinals in the first of a three-game series Tuesday. Gonzalez is 2-1 with a 1.17 ERA in three starts against St. Louis.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PITTSBURGH -- Gerrit Cole spent two innings tinkering with his offspeed stuff. After watching the Milwaukee Brewers scratch out a couple of early runs, the Pittsburgh Pirates' burgeoning ace decided to just stick to what he does best: Throw hard.	Challenging the struggling Brewers with a fastball that topped out at 99 mph, Cole guided the Pirates to a 5-2 win on Sunday. The hyper-intense righty struck out six in six innings as Pittsburgh finished off a three-game sweep while leaving Milwaukee with its worst start in team history.	The Brewers have dropped five straight and are 2-10 overall, the poorest record in the majors. Half of those losses have come to the Pirates, who are back at .500 after opening the year by getting swept in Cincinnati.	"It's really nice to string a few together in a row against your division, it can create some separation real quick," Cole said. "With the Cardinals running right now, it's good to keep winning ballgames and stay on their tail."	It's a chase the Pirates figure to be in the thick of all summer, with Cole (2-0) guiding the way. The former No. 1 overall pick is blossoming early in his third season. He's now 6-0 with a 3.06 ERA in his last eight starts overall and is 13-6 at PNC Park since making his debut on June 11, 2013. He's still refining the mechanics on his breaking pitches. The Brewers drove a couple into the outfield while scoring a pair of runs in the second inning.	Cole quickly changed course and the Brewers managed just one baserunner in his final four innings.	"As we started to get deeper into the ballgame I started locating the fastball better and kind of kept them off balance," Cole said. "They didn't seem to be catching up to it much so I just stuck with it."	Pedro Alvarez hit his fourth homer of the season for the Pirates. Josh Harrison had two hits and Chris Stewart added a two-run single in the sixth off Matt Garza (1-2). Mark Melancon worked the ninth for his second save.	Jonathan Lucroy had two of Milwaukee's six hits. Garza surrendered five runs in six innings.	"Obviously the results aren't there," Garza said. "I've started three starts and you just try to stick with the process."	The Pirates began the series hitting just .207 as a team, the lowest in the National League. That number improved to .222 after a weekend in which Pittsburgh outscored the reeling Brewers 17-7.	Milwaukee's shaky play did little to help Garza. An error, a wild pitch and an RBI single by Andrew McCutchen put the Pirates ahead 2-0 in the first. The Brewers evened it in the second on a run-scoring groundout by Jean Segura and an RBI single by Lucroy but the Brewers could get little else going against Cole.	"It was a fistfight for two and then (Cole) put his foot down," Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said. "He got in a much better lane with the fastball, which was playing up big as the game went on."	SCARY MOMENT	Pittsburgh shortstop Jordy Mercer left the game in the sixth after getting hit in the chest with an 89 mph fastball from Garza. Mercer was down on the ground for several minutes before making his way to the clubhouse.	"I'd never been hit there before and I just couldn't catch my breath," Mercer said. "I've recovered a little bit better now and take some X-rays and everything is negative so we're good."	Garza said the pitch got away from him. Jung Ho Kang pinch ran for Mercer and Stewart followed with a two-run single that broke open a one-run game.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: Pitcher Charlie Morton will likely make one more start in an extended spring training game before a decision is made on when he could return to Pittsburgh. Morton is recovering from hip surgery.	UP NEXT	Brewers: Milwaukee begins a weeklong homestand on Monday when it starts a four-game set against Cincinnati. The Brewers went 9-10 against the Reds last season and haven't beaten Cincinnati in a season series since 2006. Wily Peralta is 3-3 with a 2.88 ERA in six starts versus the Reds.	Pirates: Pittsburgh opens a four-game series with the Chicago Cubs on Monday. The Pirates are 14-6 against the Cubs over the last two seasons at PNC Park. A.J. Burnett (0-1, 2.25 ERA) gets the start. Burnett is 7-4 with a 3.25 ERA in 13 career starts against Chicago.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  After Oakland and Kansas City cleared the benches for the third straight game and five more Royals got ejected, Lorenzo Cain tried to put a positive spin on the day.	"We didn't get into a fight, so that's always good," he said.	Hit by a pitch early, Cain came back to deliver a key blow, a tying double during a three-run rally in the eighth inning that sent the Royals over Oakland 4-2 on a tense Sunday.	Cain stole third after his hit and later scored on Kendrys Morales' go-ahead double.	The trouble started right away when Kansas City manager Ned Yost and pitching coach Dave Eiland were ejected in the first inning after Cain was hit by a pitch from Scott Kazmir. That prompted plate umpire Greg Gibson to warn both teams.	"I'm not really sure if it was intentional," Cain said. "I felt like it was intentionally. He (Kazmir) did ask if I was OK."	"No one likes getting hit. It doesn't feel good. It was definitely an intense series. A lot of guys got hit by pitches. A lot of bench clearings," he said.	Cain said that at least the sides avoided a brawl.	"Fighting is not the most important thing. Winning the ballgame, beating those guys is what hurts. The way we beat them tonight is huge," he said.	In the eighth, Royals reliever Kelvin Herrera was tossed after throwing a 100 mph fastball behind Brett Lawrie. Bench coach Don Wakamatsu, the acting manager after Yost's ejection, got tossed during an ensuing argument, as did injured Royals shortstop Alcides Escobar.	"I don't mean to hurt anybody," Herrera said. "I was just trying to throw inside, but just a bad grip on that fastball. It started raining pretty good. And they just tossed me out of the game."	Herrera pointed to his head as he went into the dugout, which irritated Lawrie.	"That's what got me hot. That's what got me mad. You can't throw at my head and then say, `Next time I face you, it's in the head," Lawrie said. "He needs to play for that. He doesn't throw 85. He throws 100."	Lawrie was in the middle of the problems all weekend. His late slide forced Escobar to leave early Friday night -- the shortstop called it a "dirty slide" and didn't play the rest of the weekend.	On Saturday, Royals ace Yordano Ventura was ejected when he Lawrie with a pitch after Josh Reddick homered.	Herrera said he pointed to his head to say "think about it."	"Do whatever you want to do, I'm out of the game already," he said.	Said A's manager Bob Melvin: "What are you going to do?"	"Brett got put in a tough situation. The umpires got it right. The umpires did the right things. It's hard when they're throwing at your head. It makes you uncomfortable."	With Kansas City trailing 2-1 in the eighth, Kazmir walked Paulo Orlando and Cain hit a one-out RBI double off Eric O'Flaherty (0-1). Cain stole third, Eric Hosmer walked and Morales doubled to deep center.	Franklin Morales (1-0) threw two pitches, retiring Lawrie on a popout.	With Greg Holland on the disabled list because of a pectoral strain, Wade Davis struck out two in a perfect ninth for his second save.	Ben Zobrist hit a pair of run-scoring singles against Royals starter Danny Duffy.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: Zobrist exited in the fifth inning with left knee soreness. "I jammed it pretty hard," he said. "I didn't feel I had the range to stay in the game. It didn't feel right. I iced it. But it's not swelling up. I'll have to see how I wake up tomorrow."	Royals: 2B Omar Infante left with a strained left groin in the fifth. Orlando Calixte ran for Infante, making his major league debut.	YOU SNOOZE, YOU WIN	After being tossed in the first inning, Yost joked he fell asleep on the new comfortable couch in the manager's office. "By the time I woke up everybody was screaming and yelling in the locker room," he said.	BUTLER'S STREAK ENDS	A's DH Billy Butler went 0 for 2 and walked twice, snapping his 12-game hitting streak.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Torii Hunter feels good about his swing and so do the Minnesota Twins.	Hunter hit his first home run for Minnesota since 2007, helping Trevor May and the Twins beat the Cleveland Indians 7-2 Sunday.	"I'm just happy to get the home run out of the way in a Twins uniform in Target Field," said Hunter, flashing his charismatic smile.	Hunter, who rejoined the Twins this year after five seasons with the Los Angeles Angels and two with Detroit, hit a three-run homer in the sixth off former Minnesota pitcher Anthony Swarzak for a 7-1 lead.	He has been working with hitting coach Tom Brunansky to firm up his swing and make consistent contact.	"I've been excited about my at-bats the last four or five days," Hunter said. "I feel good right now."	So do the Twins.	Following a 1-5 opening trip, Minnesota won four of six at home against Kansas City and Cleveland.	"After the start we had, to come back here and protect our home field this week and win a couple series against teams in our division, that's a good thing for us," said manager Paul Molitor.	Making his second start since coming up from the minors when Ricky Nolasco went on the disabled list, May (1-1) allowed one run and four hits in six innings. With Ervin Santana serving a drug suspension, May is bidding to remain in the rotation when Nolasco returns from elbow inflammation.	"My biggest thing is just be ready to pitch whenever they say you're pitching," he said.	Cleveland scored on Michael Brantley's RBI single in the first and Carlos Santana's ninth-inning home run off J.R. Graham, the 100th home run of Santana's big league career.	Cleveland has scored just 13 runs in its last five games.	"I always want us to have 15 hits and nine runs," manager Terry Francona said. "We've got to fight through it, and until you really get rolling, find a way to manufacture, find a way to win by one."	TJ House (0-2) gave up five runs and seven hits in 5 2/3 innings, leaving him with a 14.14 ERA. He allowed six earned runs on six hits in 1 1/3 innings in his first start a week ago.	"One inning I'd go out there and feel great, and the next I'd be all over the place a little bit," he said. "That was a little disappointing, but definitely a step forward from the first one."	Minnesota loaded the bases in the second on a walk, double and hit batter. Oswaldo Arcia's sacrifice fly, Eduardo Escobar's RBI single and Shane Robinson's run-scoring grounder, which was misplayed by shortstop Jose Ramirez, built a 3-0 lead.	STRUGGLING SWINGERS	Seven of Minnesota's hitters entered hitting .229 or less -- four no better than .200. Cleveland had five hitters batting .220 or lower, including four under .200.	DOZIER TO THE TOP	Minnesota 2B Brian Dozier hit leadoff because SS Danny Santana got the day off after striking out three times Saturday. It was the second time this season Dozier has hit leadoff. He has hit second six times and cleanup four times.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: RHP Carlos Carrasco had his scheduled Monday start pushed back to Tuesday. He left his last start April 14 after being hit in the jaw by a line drive off the bat of Melky Cabrera. "It doesn't really do anything other than give him another day," Francona said.	Twins: Nolasco threw a bullpen session Sunday that went well. General manager Terry Ryan said Nolasco will go on a rehabilitation assignment to Class A Cedar Rapids and pitch Saturday.	UP NEXT	Indians: RHP Trevor Bauer (2-0, 1.50) is scheduled to take the mound Monday in Chicago as Cleveland opens a three-game series against the White Sox. Chicago is scheduled to start LHP John Danks (0-2, 6.97).	Twins: Minnesota starts a six-game trip in Kansas City with Kyle Gibson (1-1, 6.10) pitching against the Royals' Edinson Volquez (1-1, 2.30). In his last start, Gibson limited the Royals to one run and seven hits in 6 2/3 innings.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

HOUSTON --  Scott Feldman bounced back from a bad outing to give Houston a good start Sunday.	The hitters did just enough, too, helped by a bad bounce.	Feldman threw six solid innings and the Astros took advantage of a wild throw by catcher Drew Butera to beat the Los Angeles Angels 4-3.	Feldman (1-2) allowed two runs and six hits.	"He threw the ball very well," manager A.J. Hinch said. "I thought that as the game went on he got a little bit stronger and his best inning was probably his last with pitch quality and efficiency with where he was trying to throw the ball."	In his previous start, Oakland tagged him for eight runs in five innings.	"I felt like it was a battle," Feldman said. "I still wasn't as crisp as I'd like to throw. I thought I was getting ahead of more guys today. I had a little trouble putting them away, but it seemed like I wasn't giving up as much loud contact as I was last time."	Luke Gregerson threw a perfect ninth for his second save.	Garrett Richards (0-1), making his first start since having knee surgery late last season, gave up three earned runs on five hits and four walks in five innings.	"It wasn't a terrible first outing, I don't think," Richards said. "They had some balls that went their way, and sometimes, that's the game."	Richards struck out four. He fanned a swinging Jed Lowrie in the fifth, but the ball was in the dirt and bounced away. Butera's throw to first deflected away -- it appeared to hit Lowrie's helmet, but he said it missed -- scoring a run and setting up another.	Lowrie said he had his hands up so he didn't run face-first into first baseman Albert Pujols' glove.	"You play the game right, you play the game hard, and you let things play out the way it should," Lowrie said. "It went our way today, and it got us a win. It extended the inning."	Luis Valbuena homered for the Astros and Jose Altuve had three hits.	Pujols and C.J. Cron homered for the Angels.	Richards walked two in the first inning before escaping a bases-loaded jam.	Valbuena's two-run shot in the third put Houston on top 2-0. Cron's homer tied it in the fourth.	The wild throw by Butera allowed George Springer to score the go-ahead run, and put runners on second and third. Jason Castro followed with an RBI single on a dribbler to make it 4-2.	"We didn't play a crisp game, defensively," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "We let some things slip away. If you're not swinging the bats, you've got to make sure you're getting the outs you're supposed to get, and we're having trouble doing that."	Pujols connected against Pat Neshek in the eighth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: Richards was activated from the disabled list Sunday. The Angels optioned LHP Adam Wilk to Triple-A Salt Lake after the game Saturday.	Astros: RHP Josh Fields (groin) is set to throw a two-inning outing Monday for Triple-A Fresno. He has made four rehab appearances for Fresno, allowing two earned runs in four innings.	UP NEXT	Angels: RHP Matt Shoemaker (2-0) goes for his third straight win to begin the season at home against Oakland on Monday. The Angels have won 10 straight games he has appeared in dating to last season.	Astros: RHP Asher Wojciechowski (0-1) makes his second start of the season third appearance Monday at Seattle. Wojciechowski, who was recalled from Triple-A Fresno Friday, threw four scoreless innings in relief Monday against Oakland.	ALTUVE HEATING UP	Altuve extended his hitting streak to nine games. The second baseman, who led the majors in hits last season with 225, already has four multihit games this season and two three-hit games.	FRIENDLY CONFINES	Pujols received scattered boos from fans at Minute Maid Park, possibly from fans who still remember his deciding homer in Game 5 of the 2005 National League Championship Series in Houston.	Pujols now has 25 home runs in his career at Minute Maid Park, which is tops among visiting players all-time. His third homer of the season was the 523rd of his career.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO --  Jon Lester believes he is getting close to pitching like the ace the Cubs signed in the offseason.	Lester made a nifty play with his glove, but lost again and the San Diego Padres beat Chicago 5-2 Sunday.	Lester (0-2), who signed a $155 million, six-year contract as a free agent, has a 6.89 ERA after three starts.	"I don't like to evaluate things that way as far as being almost there or not almost there, but it was better," Lester said.	"For the most part, I did a pretty good job of keeping the ball on the ground and that's important, it means I'm getting action on the pitches I need, getting some mishits, which was good today."	Lester gave up three runs and six hits in 5 1/3 innings. He alertly tossed his glove -- with the ball stuck in the webbing -- to first baseman Anthony Rizzo for an out after fielding Clint Barmes' comebacker in the second.	Lester has pitched six innings or fewer in three straight starts for the first time since he did it in four consecutive starts June 6-21, 2013, but he believes he is getting closer to pitching like the ace the Cubs signed.	"Obviously the results are not there," Lester said "We all go out there to try to win the game and that's the results we want. That's not there, but when you sit back and evaluate it was better, not there, but better."	Will Middlebrooks and Yangervis Solarte hit two-run homers to help Andrew Cashner (1-2).	Joaquin Benoit pitched a scoreless ninth for his first save. Padres closer Craig Kimbrel got the day off after pitching the previous two days.	Kris Bryant, who made his major league debut on Friday, doubled and was hit by a pitch in going 1 for 3. He is 3 for 10 with one RBI in three games for the Cubs.	Cashner, Brandon Maurer, Shawn Kelley and Benoit finished with three shutout innings. Benoit struck out Jorge Soler with runners on first and second to end the game.	Lester was pulled after 97 pitches in the sixth with runners on first and second and one out. Reliever Brian Schlitter retired the first batter he faced, but gave up a go-ahead single to Will Venable.	Cubs manager Joe Maddon doesn't expect to see the early season struggles continue for Lester, who experienced "dead arm" issues in spring training.	"He is getting better," Maddon said. "I think he is getting a little bit sharper with everything. You can see he was frustrated on certain pitches today, but like I said, I think this one (start) or the next one I think you're going to see him getting back to normal."	Solarte homered off Jason Motte in the seventh.	The Cubs took advantage of two errors by the Padres to score twice in the first.	Padres manager Bud Black had a mound visit in the first inning, but the message wasn't solely directed at Cashner.	"I had a few things to say to the guys," Black said. "I'd rather not share exactly what I said. I think it was the time for me to get the group together."	Black was ejected by plate umpire James Hoye in the second after Lester's first pitch to Middlebrooks was called a strike. Black yelled from the dugout and was tossed.	"The bench was a little bit verbal and I was part of that," Black said.	Black walked on the field and talked to Hoye and crew chief John Hirschbeck before heading to the clubhouse. On the next pitch, Middlebrooks tied the game with a long homer, his third of the season.	"I don't like to say it was one pitch that did me in, but I just didn't execute the cutter in to Middlebrooks," Lester said. "He made me pay for it, especially after we scored two off of Cashner."	UP NEXT	Padres: Odrisamer Despaigne (1-0) will try to back up an impressive start against the Diamondbacks with his second start of the season at Colorado on Monday.	Cubs: Jake Arrieta will be making his first start on the road against Pittsburgh on Monday. In two starts, the right-hander is 1-1 with a 1.98 ERA.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN FRANCISCO --  After a last-place finish a year ago, the Arizona Diamondbacks will take solace in any small positives to start this season. A winning trip and series victory against the defending World Series champions sure counts as one.	San Francisco nemesis Paul Goldschmidt hit a two-run homer to help Jeremy Hellickson get his first win for Arizona, 5-1 over the struggling Giants on Sunday.	"It was a good win, but it only counts for one," Goldschmidt said. "It doesn't really matter in the long scheme of things, but any time you can get a win, it's good."	Chris Owings added a two-run single and A.J. Pollock had three hits, scored two runs and made a run-saving diving catch for the Diamondbacks, who took three of four in San Francisco.	Arizona won four of seven against San Diego and San Francisco for its first winning trip since sweeping Colorado in a three-game series last June.	Tim Hudson (0-2) allowed five runs in five innings as San Francisco (4-10) lost for the ninth time in 10 games to match the worst start for the franchise since the team moved here in 1958.	"Right now, all we're trying to do is find a way to go out there and play good baseball," Hudson said. "We can pitch better, we can field better and we can hit better. You do those things better, you're going to be better."	One day after snapping an eight-game losing streak, the Giants found themselves in an early hole against the Diamondbacks thanks to a player who has done plenty of damage against San Francisco in recent years.	Goldschmidt hit the first pitch he saw from Hudson over the left-field fence for a two-run shot. Since his debut on Aug. 1, 2011, Goldschmidt leads all players with 12 homers, 45 RBIs and 32 extra-base hits against the Giants.	"I've been able to have some success," he said. "You never know when that's going to change. It could be a terrible series next time. I just try to get a good pitch to hit, hit it hard and keep it simple."	Hudson, who has gotten only one run of support in three starts, lost his control in the third and the Giants never recovered. Hudson walked two batters and hit Jordan Pacheco with the bases loaded to force in a run. Owings broke the game open with his hit on an 0-2 pitch that made it 5-1.	"There's such a fine line in this game," manager Bruce Bochy said. "They end up putting up a big number and it changes the game. They outplayed us."	That was more than enough for Hellickson (1-2), who allowed one runs and eight hits in 6 2/3 innings.	San Francisco got on the board in the first when Nori Aoki doubled and scored on Angel Pagan's sacrifice fly. But three double plays and Pollock's diving catch in center to rob Hudson and end the second inning with two runners on base helped Hellickson avoid any more damage.	"I wouldn't be standing here in this good of a mood if they didn't do what they did," Hellickson said of his defense. "A.J., that might have won the game right there. Then the double plays that they made. They were awesome."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: C Gerard Laird (back) is eligible to come off the disabled list Friday.	Giants: Manager Bruce Bochy said he will likely use either Ryan Vogelsong or Yusmeiro Petit in place of injured starter Jake Peavy on Thursday against Los Angeles rather than moving up the rest of the rotation because of Monday's off-day.	GOING DEEP	Arizona starting pitchers keyed the success on this trip, with the team getting at least six innings from the starter in all seven games.	"It's contagious," Hellickson said. "If a guy throw six, seven innings and does well, you don't want to be that guy who goes out and throw four or five."	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: Off on Monday before Texas native Chase Anderson (0-0) takes on the Rangers for the first time in his career to start a two-game series Tuesday.	Giants: San Francisco gets its first off-day of the season Monday after playing 14 straight days. The Giants then open a three-game series at home on Tuesday against the Dodgers.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SEATTLE -- Nelson Cruz showed power early on Sunday with two home runs, and patience and resiliency late coming through with the winning hit in the ninth inning after three strikeouts.	It was a display by Cruz of the many reasons why Seattle paid last offseason to add him to its lineup.	"Even when you hit homers you have to forget about what you do the (last) at-bat. I strike out three times and I have to forget about what happened the previous at-bats," Cruz said. "That's the beauty about baseball. You have a chance to do damage every time you go up there."	Austin Jackson singled in the tying run in the ninth inning, Cruz followed with a two-out single for his fifth RBI of the game, and the Mariners overcame a pair of five-run deficits to beat the Texas Rangers 11-10.	Cruz homered twice in the first three innings, raising his major league-leading total to eight, and Jackson hit the 11th leadoff homer of his career.	That was just the start. The big drama came late as Seattle rallied from deficits of 7-2 and 10-5, scoring six runs in the final three innings.	"This team is a very gritty bunch. They're built for this. They're tough. Character-wise they're tough," Seattle manager Lloyd McClendon said. "We have a nice mix of veterans and young players. This team is built for greatness. I don't know what's going to happen but I like where we are."	Brad Miller led off the ninth with a single off Neftali Feliz (0-1) and advanced on Seth Smith's one-out walk. Jackson lined a single to right that fell in front of Shin-Soo Choo and allowed Miller to score.	After Rickie Weeks' popout and an intentional walk to Robinson Cano, Cruz lined a 96 mph pitch into left field to score Smith. It was a bit of redemption for Cruz after he struck out against Feliz in the eighth inning.	Feliz had not blown a save chance since Aug. 3 at Cleveland and allowed earned runs to Seattle for the first time in 23 career appearances against the Mariners.	"I was trying to keep the ball low and (Cruz) is a good hitter," Feliz said through a translator. "The ball he hit at the end was a low ball and he made good contact on it."	Cruz hit a solo homer in the first and a three-run drive in the third, his first two homers this season at home. Cruz is the first player with eight home runs in a team's first 12 games since Alex Rodriguez in 2007. Cruz struck out in his next three at-bats, then got the seventh game-winning RBI of his career and first since 2012.	Over the past eight games, Cruz is hitting .485 with 14 RBIs.	"I've played against him quite a bit. This is no surprise to me," Jackson said of Cruz. "I've been on the other side of that and it's impressive to watch. I'm just glad he's on my side now."	PITCHING PROBLEMS	Yoervis Medina (1-0) pitched the ninth to get the victory. Seattle starter James Paxton and Texas' Ross Detwiler failed to make it out of the third inning.	Texas scored seven runs in the third inning off Paxton, sending 11 batters to the plate. Jake Smolinski's two-run homer was the big blow of the inning. The Rangers added three more in the sixth inning, including RBI singles by Choo and Mitch Moreland.	"We were lucky to win that game today. We have to pitch better and I think our guys understand that," McClendon said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: Moreland, who missed the previous two games with a sore elbow, came on as a pinch hitter in the sixth and remained in the game at first base. Moreland flied out to the wall in left-center in the eighth.	Mariners: Catcher Mike Zunino came close to getting his first full day off of the season but caught the ninth inning after Jesus Sucre was pulled for a pinch hitter.	UP NEXT	Rangers: Texas has an off day on Monday before opening interleague play with a two-game series against Arizona on Tuesday. Nick Martinez will start the opener.	Mariners: Hisashi Iwakuma will get the start on Monday night when Seattle opens a three-game series against Houston.

LOS ANGELES -- The Dodgers are leading the NL in home runs, even without Matt Kemp and Hanley Ramirez.	Howie Kendrick, Scott Van Slyke and rookie Joc Pederson homered against rookie Scott Oberg in the sixth inning, and Los Angeles stretched its winning streak to seven by beating the Colorado Rockies 7-0 Sunday.	"I haven't seen the ball fly here at Dodger Stadium like the way it's done so far this year," catcher A.J. Ellis said. "Hopefully, I hope they're not talking about putting in a humidor or anything like that. We don't have to have any of that talk."	Brandon McCarthy (2-0) allowed three hits in six innings, struck out six and walked two to defeat the Rockies for the first time in five career starts.	"I made better pitches today and stayed away from the middle of the plate, for the most part," said McCarthy, who played high school ball in Colorado Springs. "A.J. just took me along with him, and we just kept attacking the hitters. But we did it without being stupid and didn't leave it in a spot where they could drive it."	Eddie Butler (1-1) allowed two runs and six hits over five innings.	Justin Turner tied a career high with four hits for the two-time defending NL West champions, who took a 2-0 lead in the second with consecutive RBI doubles by Van Slyke and Pederson en route to their ninth straight victory over the Rockies. Adrian Gonzalez was 0 for 4, ending his hitting streak at 13 games, but his teammates combined for 14 hits and raised the team's home run total to 17.	"On a day when our best hitter -- and the best hitter in baseball right now -- didn't have a single hit, we still put up seven runs and 14 hits. That's the mark of a great team," Ellis said.	Kendrick then led off the sixth with his second homer of the series before Andre Ethier walked. First baseman Justin Morneau dropped a foul pop by Van Slyke, prolonging the at-bat, and Van Slyke hit his first homer of the season.	"Van Slyke's a tough out. And if you give him an extra chance, more times than not it ends up hurting you," Rockies manager Walt Weiss said.	Pederson followed with a drive to right-center on an 0-2 count, extending the margin to 6-0, and Turner capped the rally with an RBI double.	Shortstop Jimmy Rollins turned a huge inning-ending double play in the top of the sixth, just nipping Troy Tulowitzki at first base after McCarthy fielded his comebacker with runners at the corners.	"Jimmy's got tons of experience in the middle of the diamond," Ellis said. "He's seen and experienced everything a guy with 16 years in the big leagues can, and you don't see him panic. It seems like Jimmy always makes the throw or makes the play to get the guy out."	Ellis, who lost his starting job with the acquisition of Yasmani Grandal from San Diego in the Kemp trade, made his first start behind the plate since April 13 and threw out Charlie Blackmon trying to steal second base in the third. Blackmon appeared to have beaten the throw, but Rollins blocked his slide with his foot before applying the tag.	"Brandon gave me a great chance to throw the guy out," Ellis said. "It was a very mediocre throw, and I figured Charlie was going to be safe because he's an excellent baserunner. But Jimmy just did a great job. I kidded with him and said: 'It looks like Chase Utley finally taught you something.' "	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rockies: RHP John Axford, whose 2½-year-old son Jameson was bitten on the right foot by a rattlesnake during spring training, was moved from the family emergency medical leave list to the restricted list on Sunday.	Dodgers: RF Yasiel Puig sat out for the fourth time in five games because of a sore left hamstring, which didn't get any better after he went 2 for 3 with a walk and an RBI double on Saturday night.	UP NEXT	Rockies: LHP Jorge De La Rosa is expected to be reinstated from the disabled list on Monday to make his season debut in the opener of a four-game series against San Diego at Coors Field. He was sidelined for most of spring training because of a groin injury.	Dodgers: LHP Brett Anderson (1-0) is scheduled to start the opener of a three-game series at San Francisco on Tuesday night. He is 0-2 with a 5.25 ERA in three career starts against the Giants, all at AT&T Park.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

ST. LOUIS --  Two on and two out in the eighth inning with the heart of the Cincinnati Reds lineup due in a tie game, Adam Wainwright was at a crossroads.	In a brief mound meeting that matched the brisk pace of the game in a 2-1 victory Sunday night, St. Louis Cardinals manager Mike Matheny showed faith in his ace.	"He just said, `You feel good?" Wainwright recalled. "I said `Yes sir.' He said `All right, this is your game, let's go."	Wainwright walked cleanup man Jay Bruce on a full count, giving him nothing to hit, before escaping. Kolten Wong then hit a tiebreaking sacrifice fly off Mike Leake in the bottom half to help the Cardinals finish a three-game sweep.	"At that point he's the guy we want in the game," Matheny said. "It's hard taking him out of the game in that situation."	Matt Carpenter hit his fifth career leadoff homer and singled for his eighth multihit effort this season as the Cardinals won their fifth straight. Jordan Walden worked around a leadoff hit by Brennan Boesch in the ninth to earn his first save on a night off for closer Trevor Rosenthal.	The game lasted just 2 hours, 2 minutes.	"You blink and it's the next inning," Walden said. "We're sitting down there like `It's already the fifth? Like `Wow, we'd better start stretching.'	"It's good, though. We don't have to sit down there and just look at each other."	Wainwright (2-1) gave up one run and seven hits with four strikeouts and two walks, improving to 3-0 against the Reds the last two seasons. Leake was more economical, throwing 86 pitches with 66 for strikes.	"Coming into the game against Wainwright you know you've got to go out and put up low numbers," Leake said. "It's fun facing guys like that."	Leake (0-1) gave up both runs and four hits in eight innings for the Reds, who have totaled four runs during a four-game losing streak. Brandon Phillips had two hits and an RBI and Joey Votto singled in his first two trips.	"I know we've got a much better offense than we've shown to this point," manager Bryan Price said. "I don't think we're reaching to think that the lineup that we have out there is capable of not just scoring runs, but scoring a lot of runs."	Zack Cozart grounded into a forceout to end the eighth and is 0 for 6 with runners in scoring position.	Leake got through seven innings on just 76 pitches before Jon Jay doubled to open the eighth, advanced on a fly out and scored without a play on Wong's sacrifice fly to left.	Leake and Wainwright combined for 25 consecutive outs before Carpenter ended Leake's run of 15 in a row with a one out-single in the sixth that hiked his average to .400. Carpenter has six consecutive multihit games and nine in the first 11.	Tucker Barnhart's two-out single in the seventh halted an 0-for-12 stretch against Wainwright with two strikeouts and two balls hit out of the infield.	Carpenter's fifth career leadoff homer to straightaway center, tied for third-most in franchise history, gave the Cardinals the early lead. It was his first leadoff homer since July 22, 2014 against Tampa Bay.	Three straight Reds reached with two outs in the third and Phillips' bloop single tied it, ending Wainwright's run of 19 2/3 consecutive scoreless innings against Cincinnati.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: C Devin Mesoraco may be close to returning to the lineup. He missed his sixth straight start with a left hip injury but was available Sunday to pinch hit. ... OF Billy Hamilton was much improved from a groin injury beating out an infield hit Saturday and though he didn't start also was available.	Cardinals: Matt Holliday started in LF a day after coming out with back tightness after scoring in the first inning. He has an 11-game hitting streak after singling in the first.	RUN TO GLORY	Before the game, Go! St. Louis Marathon women's winner Andrea Karl ran through finishing tape on the warning track in honor of the victory first granted to an imposter recently.	UP NEXT	Reds: Anthony DeSclafani allowed two hits in seven scoreless innings his last time out at Chicago and faces the Brewers for the second time.	Cardinals: The Cardinals are off Monday before starting a six-game trip. Lance Lynn (1-1, 1.64) gets the call Tuesday at Washington.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

BOSTON --  The way Justin Masterson was pitching, he didn't need much help. The Orioles gave it to him, anyway.	On a rainy, chilly Patriots' Day holiday, Baltimore made three errors that led to five unearned runs, Wei-Yin Chen struggled with his control and the Boston Red Sox won 7-1 Monday in a game shortened by rain to 6 1/2 innings.	"The errors kind of gift-wrapped or built into the four-run inning, along with some bases on balls," Boston manager John Farrell said. "At this level, you give extra outs, you're asking for trouble."	The first pitch was thrown at 11:04 a.m. after Boston Marathon runners already were on the course that passes close to Fenway Park. Rain began falling steadily in the fourth inning, and the game was called after a 1-hour, 42-minute wait.	"It was the same for both teams," Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said. "It was a little bit hard for anybody on the mound to throw the ball where they wanted."	Masterson (2-0) allowed one run, three hits and three walks in five innings with six strikeouts. He didn't want to change his plan to get five innings in before the rain, to make the game official.	"We're not just laying balls in there, because that's kind of the way things snowball," Masterson said. "All of a sudden now you've got the bases loaded and you're giving up a grand slam or putting people in a bad spot."	With the score tied at 1, Boston scored four runs in the third when Chen walked four and made an error, and third baseman Manny Machado committed another error.	Chen (0-1) thought plate umpire Andy Fletcher had a small strike zone.	"When you make a pitch and can't throw it for a strike, you can't throw the next pitch down the middle," Chen said through a translator. "It kind of upset me."	Chen gave up three hits and five walks after getting the win in Baltimore's 7-6 victory at Fenway last year on Patriots' Day, which commemorates the first battles of the Revolutionary War.	Boston took a 1-0 lead in the first when Mookie Betts singled, stole second, took third on catcher Ryan Lavarnway's wild throw and scored on David Ortiz's sacrifice fly.	Baltimore tied it in the second on Travis Snider's triple and Ryan Flaherty's double.	Xander Bogaerts led off the third with a walk, took third on a single by Ryan Hanigan and scored when Chen bobbled Betts' grounder. Dustin Pedroia sacrificed, and Allen Craig loaded the bases with a walk.	Mike Napoli walked, forcing in a run, and Machado's error allowed Betts and Craig to score.	Baltimore had three errors, the first game this season in which the Orioles committed more than one. They have seven errors this year, three by pitchers.	Boston made it 7-1 in the sixth. Hanigan was hit for the second time and scored on Pedroia's double off Jason Garcia. After Ortiz was walked intentionally, Craig singled in Pedroia.	Baltimore's Adam Jones had his nine-game hitting streak snapped after going 7 for 10 in the previous two games.	FAST PITCHER	Three-time Boston Marathon winner Bill Rodgers threw out the ceremonial first pitch. It reached Wade Miley, Boston's left-handed pitcher who was behind the plate, on a fly.	SERIES SUCCESS	The Red Sox earned a split of the four-game series after winning their other three so far this season.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: Showalter thinks INF Jonathan Schoop, who went on the 15-day disabled list with a sprained right knee Saturday, could be back sooner than the six to eight weeks originally forecast. Schoop is rehabbing in Sarasota, Florida.	Red Sox: LF Hanley Ramirez left in the top of the third because of illness. He was replaced by Craig. 3B Pablo Sandoval was out of the lineup for a day of rest. Brock Holt (12 for 24 coming into the game) started in his place and went 0 for 2.	UP NEXT:	Orioles: RHP Bud Norris (0-1, 12.38 ERA) pitches Tuesday the opener of a three-game series in Toronto against LHP Mark Buehrle (2-0, 3.75). Norris won his last start, allowing three runs in five innings against the New York Yankees. In his other start this year, he gave up eight runs in three innings in a loss to Toronto.	Red Sox: Miley (0-1, 10.57) pitches the opener of a three-game series at Tampa Bay on Tuesday against RHP Chris Archer (2-1, 1.37). It begins a six-game trip. In his last start, Miley allowed seven runs in 2 1/3 innings in his Fenway debut, a 10-5 loss to Washington this season.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

DETROIT -- The newcomers to Detroit's starting rotation are certainly pulling their weight so far.	Alfredo Simon pitched impressively into the eighth inning Monday night, and the Tigers added another victory to baseball's best record with a 2-1 win over the New York Yankees. J.D. Martinez and Yoenis Cespedes hit consecutive RBI singles in the seventh to help Detroit rally.	Simon (3-0) allowed a run and seven hits in 7 1/3 innings, striking out seven without a walk. He and Shane Greene were the less-heralded additions who replaced Max Scherzer and Rick Porcello in Detroit's rotation. So far, they're a combined 6-0 with a 1.03 ERA.	"I think our starting pitching, as ballyhooed as the offensive lineup is, our starting pitching has been the backbone of our start," manager Brad Ausmus said.	Joba Chamberlain relieved Simon and got Jacoby Ellsbury to hit into a crucial double play in the eighth, and Joakim Soria pitched the ninth for his fifth save. The Tigers (11-2) remained a game ahead of Kansas City atop the AL Central.	CC Sabathia (0-3) faced the minimum number of hitters through the first six innings, but with two out and a man on second in the seventh, the Yankees intentionally walked Victor Martinez. J.D. Martinez followed with a sharp single that shortstop Didi Gregorius was unable to keep in the infield, and Cespedes' single scored Martinez.	With Chase Headley on second and one out in the eighth, Gregorius singled up the middle. Rajai Davis bobbled the ball in center, but Headley had already been held up at third.	Then Chamberlain came on in a huge spot against his former team. Ellsbury's hard grounder went right to second baseman Ian Kinsler, and the double play ended the threat.	"I live for that stuff. It's so fun to come in, in a situation like that," Chamberlain said. "You've got to be able to get a big play, and back up our guy that was strong for us for seven innings."	Mark Teixeira's second-inning homer put the Yankees up 1-0, and Sabathia kept the lead for a while. Detroit hit into three double plays in the first six innings, and Jose Iglesias was caught stealing in the third when Sabathia stepped off the mound and caught him between first and second. The 6-foot-7 left-hander went over and tagged Iglesias out himself.	Rajai Davis singled to start the Detroit seventh, then hustled to second on Kinsler's flyout to deep left.	"That was a really smart play that turned into a huge play for them," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "He knows this park really well, and he's a lot faster than we wish he was, so he was able to take that base and keep them out of a double play."	Miguel Cabrera grounded out in an unusual 6-4-3 putout -- Gregorius threw to second to try to catch Davis off the base, and although the Detroit runner got back safely, Stephen Drew still had time to relay the ball to first in time to get Cabrera.	Victor Martinez was then given his free pass, and J.D. Martinez and Cespedes put the Tigers ahead.	Sabathia allowed two runs and seven hits in eight innings -- his 38th career complete game and first since 2013. He threw 98 pitches.	Alex Rodriguez went hitless with a strikeout for the Yankees. He had to duck twice to get out of the way of Simon's pitches -- although both looked like curveballs and were measured in the mid-70s on the stadium scoreboard.	"My mom's birthday is today," Simon said. "She asked me, `I want you to strike out Alex Rodriguez and win the game."	GOOD GLOVES	Both teams looked good defensively. Ellsbury made a lunging, sliding catch in center to retire Victor Martinez in the fifth, and J.D. Martinez followed with a sinking fly to left that was caught by a diving Brett Gardner.	The speedy Gardner hit a grounder in the sixth that Iglesias fielded while running hard to his right. The Detroit shortstop managed to flip the ball across his body to first in time for the out.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: RF Carlos Beltran returned from a cold and started in right field, but he went hitless with two strikeouts.	Tigers: Trainer Kevin Rand said RHP Justin Verlander had an MRI recently, but it didn't show anything beyond the original diagnosis of a right triceps strain. Verlander has not pitched this season.	UP NEXT	Detroit's Kyle Lobstein (1-0) -- in the rotation because of Verlander's injury -- takes the mound Tuesday night against New York's Nathan Eovaldi (0-0).

PITTSBURGH -- Kris Bryant had so much fun rounding the bases that the star rookie felt like he was a kid again.	And why not?	Bryant turned his tiebreaking two-run double into a Little League homer with some heads-up baserunning, and had three hits and three RBIs Monday night to lead the Chicago Cubs to a 5-2 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates.	Bryant's double off the base of the left-center field fence in the seventh inning snapped a 1-all tie. He advanced to third base on the throw home and raced across the plate when catcher Francisco Cervelli missed the throw for an error.	"That was fun," Bryant said with a grin. "I don't ever remember ever running all around the bases like that before."	Bryant, who tied the game with an RBI single in the fifth, is 6 for 14 (.429) with four RBIs in four games since his much-anticipated callup from Triple-A Iowa on Friday. He was a spring training sensation, hitting nine home runs in 40 at-bats for the Cubs.	"He's doing a nice job and there's a really nice slow heartbeat going on right now," Chicago manager Joe Maddon said. "He's just out there playing the game really like I thought he would coming out of spring training."	Bryant could be joined Tuesday on the Cubs by another top prospect, Addison Russell. The shortstop began playing second base in Triple-A Iowa last weekend, a position that has been a problem in the Cubs' lineup.	"You never know where the need is going to be on the major league level," Maddon said. "Being a little bit more proactive regarding prepping (Russell) for a need that might be open here."	Cubs second basemen were hitting a combined .135 entering Monday. Chicago has already had three players start at the position in the season's first 12 games -- Arismendy Alcantara, Jonathan Herrera and Tommy La Stella.	Russell is hitting .318 with one home run, nine RBIs and one stolen base in 11 games for Iowa.	"You think his bat may be ready to play, you have to get him a position to play," Maddon said.	Jake Arrieta (2-1) allowed only one run and three hits in seven innings for the win while striking out seven and walking none.	"We've seen their starting pitcher before and we know how good he is," Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said. "Some nights, there really isn't anything you can do but tip your hat to the opposing pitcher. He pitched a great game, so all we can do is go home and come back tomorrow."	Jorge Soler, another rookie, went 4 for 5 with a one-out double in the seventh that started the go-ahead rally. Anthony Rizzo followed by drawing a walk then Bryant hit his double off Arquimedes Camninero (0-1).	Rizzo and Starlin Castro each had two of the Cubs' 14 hits.	Starling Marte homered for the Pirates, who had their three-game winning streak snapped in the bottom of the ninth inning and Andrew McCutchen had two hits, including an RBI single in the ninth. It was Marte's third home run in four games.	Pirates starter A.J. Burnett allowed one run and eight hits in six innings. He walked two and struck out one.	The start of the game was delayed 28 minutes because of rain.	FAN INJURED	The game was delayed 23 minutes in the second inning after a female fan behind home plate was hit in the back of the head by a ball off the bat of Castro.	The woman was standing in the first row with her back toward the field when Castro fouled a ball straight back against the protective screen. The ball was hit with such force that it struck the fan.	The injured fan was eventually removed from the seating area on a stretcher. The Pirates said she was conscious and alert when she was taken to a hospital for testing.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: SS Jordy Mercer sat out with a bruised chest, an injury he sustained Sunday when he was hit by a pitch from Milwaukee RHP Matt Garza. Mercer might be ready to play Tuesday night. The Pirates said Sunday the injury was to Mercer's ribcage but Hurdle said Monday it was to the chest.	UP NEXT	Cubs LHP Travis Wood (1-1) will face LHP Francisco Liriano (0-1) on Tuesday night in the second game of the four-game series. Wood is 3-4 with 4.28 ERA in 14 career games, including 13 starts against the Pirates. Liriano is 4-2 against the Cubs with a 2.30 ERA and has allowed more than two runs in just two of his nine starts against them.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

MILWAUKEE --  After struggling in a limited role last year, Anthony Desclafani has enjoyed considerable early season success with his new team.	Acquired by the Cincinnati Reds in a December trade with Miami for pitcher Mat Latos, Desclafani (2-0) tossed eight shutout innings in a 6-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers on Monday night. Desclafani limited Milwaukee to two hits and ran his scoreless innings streak to 15.	"I've felt really comfortable with this team from Day One," said Desclafani, who held Milwaukee hitless until Adam Lind's double with two outs in the fourth.	It was the third straight strong outing for Desclafani. In his previous outing last Tuesday, he held Chicago to two hits in seven scoreless innings.	"He was locked in," Reds manager Bryan Price said.	Price described the 25-year-old Desclafani as "an inherently confident guy" despite his lack of major league experience.	"This is what we heard about when we were in the trade discussions with Miami but no one can expect anybody to come out and throw as well as he has," Price said.	Reds catcher Brayan Pena had high praise for his young battery mate.	"The key today was he was ahead in the count," Pena said. "He continued to attack the strike zone."	Desclafani and Milwaukee starter Wily Peralta (0-2) were locked in a scoreless battle through five innings. The Reds got to Peralta in the sixth. Pena drove in the game's first run with a sacrifice fly and Zach Cozart followed with a three-run homer.	"(Peralta) got a little wild and he left one over the plate to me," Cozart said.	Joey Votto added a two-run homer in the seventh off Peralta, who allowed six runs over seven innings.	"It's hard to believe with the stuff he had today that he ends up with six runs against him," Milwaukee manager Ron Roenicke said.	Ryan Braun homered with one out in the ninth for the Brewers.	RALLY KILLER	Milwaukee had runners on first and second and one out in the fifth when Pena made a diving catch of Peralta's popped up, two-strike bunt attempt. Pena threw to first for an easy double play. "I was just trying to execute a pitch and trying to get Peralta to jab at a pitch. Pena made a great catch. He's a heck of an athlete," Desclafani said.	ON SECOND THOUGHT	Cincinnati appeared to score in the second when Pena slid into home and was ruled safe on Desclafani's single. Umpires overturned the call after a Milwaukee challenge, costing the Cincinnati pitcher an RBI. "It would have been nice but it's all right. I'll take a win for the team instead," Desclafani said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: C Devin Mesoraco remained away from the team for an undisclosed family issue. He is expected to return Tuesday, Price said. Mesoraco hasn't played since April 12 due to a left hip impingement. ... Desclafini was hit in the calf in the fourth inning but remained in the game.	Brewers: C Jonathan Lucroy left the game in the seventh after a foul tip hit his left foot. The Brewers placed Lucroy on the DL immediately after the game with a fractured toe. . 2B Scooter Gennett sat out after receiving five stitches to close a wound to a knuckle on his left hand that he suffered in the shower after Sunday afternoon's game in Pittsburgh. Gennett said he sliced open the knuckle on a metal shower rack. "It was definitely a freakish thing. It started bleeding everywhere." Gennett said he hopes to return to the lineup by Wednesday. Roenicke, however, didn't rule out a DL stint for Gennett.	UP NEXT	Reds: Jason Marquis (0-1, 6.30) takes the mound in the second of the three-game set on Tuesday. The veteran hurler will make his 22nd career start against the Brewers. He's 6-12 against Milwaukee.	Brewers: Mike Fiers (0-2, 5.91 ERA) is 1/3 with a 3.08 ERA in six career games (four starts) against the Reds. Fiers took a 3-1 loss in his only start against Cincinnati last season.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CHICAGO --  Melky Cabrera threw his arms into the air as he rounded first base, and then was mobbed by the rest of his jubilant teammates.	One big finish rescued what had been a lousy night for the Chicago White Sox.	Cabrera capped Chicago's four-run ninth inning with an RBI single off Cody Allen, sending the White Sox to a 4-3 victory over the Cleveland Indians on Monday.	"I went to the home plate trying to put the ball in play and thank God I can do it," Cabrera said through a translator.	Six consecutive batters reached safely before Cabrera drove a fastball into left-center for his first game-ending hit since he signed a $42 million, three-year contract with Chicago over the winter. Alexei Ramirez doubled home two runs and Gordon Beckham had a tying RBI single.	Allen (0-2) recorded just one out in his first blown save in four chances.	"Left some balls up. Got a little predictable," Allen said. "Some good hitters, man, hitting's contagious. Couple hits, they were kind of racing to the bat rack there at the end."	David Robertson (1-0) worked a perfect ninth for his first win with the White Sox. Chicago had just four hits before the ninth-inning rally.	"I'm glad there's no clock," manager Robin Ventura said. "They couldn't stall. You eventually have to get it and guys had some good at-bats there in the ninth."	Trevor Bauer pitched seven sparkling innings for Cleveland, which has dropped seven of nine. Ryan Raburn and Brett Hayes homered, and Michael Brantley had an RBI double.	Bauer allowed four hits while lowering his ERA to 0.95. The right-hander beat Chicago in his previous outing, logging six effective innings in a 4-2 victory at home on Wednesday.	"I felt a lot better mechanically today," he said. "I was a little bit off last outing. I felt a lot better. I felt like my release point was more consistent."	Perhaps most importantly for Bauer and the Indians, he struck out seven and walked two in his longest start of the season. He walked nine in his first two outings.	Chicago left-hander John Danks allowed three runs and six hits in six innings in his best start of the young season.	Raburn had two hits and a walk on a damp, cool night, continuing his long history of tormenting the White Sox. He is a .301 hitter in 108 games against Chicago, with 18 of his 75 career homers.	He belted a long solo drive to left in the second for his first homer of the season. It was his fourth career homer against Danks.	Brantley doubled home Mike Aviles in the third, and Hayes went deep in the fifth in his first start of the season. Hayes' drive to left hit the top of the wall and bounced over for his first homer since May 28 for Kansas City against Houston.	SPECIAL ADDITION	The White Sox had Carlos Rodon in their bullpen after the touted prospect was promoted from Triple-A Charlotte before the game. They also reinstated Jake Petricka from the 15-day disabled list after the reliever was sidelined by a right forearm strain.	Rodon, 22, was a late cut in spring training. The No. 3 overall pick in last year's draft then went 1-0 with a 3.60 ERA in two starts with the Knights before the White Sox decided it was time to join the big league club.	"It's a dream come true," Rodon said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox: RHP Javy Guerra was placed on the disabled list with shoulder inflammation, and right-hander Kyle Drabek was designated for assignment. The move for Guerra is retroactive to April 13.	UP NEXT	Indians RHP Carlos Carrasco makes his first start since he was struck by a line drive off the bat of White Sox outfielder Melky Cabrera in the first inning of a 4-1 loss last Tuesday. Carrasco (1-1, 2.84 ERA) was carted off the field after the ball glanced off his glove and right hand before hitting him on the right side of his face. He had his next start pushed back a day, but Francona said he is ready to go.	RHP Hector Noesi (0-1, 3.86 ERA) gets the ball for the White Sox in his first start since the home opener on April 10.	---	Jay Cohen can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/jcohenap	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Edinson Volquez is quickly proving his breakthrough season of a year ago was no fluke.	The Royals right-hander held down the Twins for seven innings Monday night, and Kansas City's opportunistic offense took advantage of a series of Minnesota miscues in a 7-1 victory.	"It feels good because the way I'm pitching, I'm carrying over everything," said Volquez, who went 13-7 with a 3.04 ERA for Pittsburgh. "Just trying to do what I did last year."	Royals manager Ned Yost said that pitching coach Dave Eiland has been working on mechanics with Volquez (2-1) that have allowed him to pitch even better than he did with the Pirates. He only allowed five hits and a walk while striking out five against Minnesota.	"We've been talking about him since he first got here," Yost said. "We felt last year was a big year for him. He really turned the corner with his mechanics on some things."	Alcides Escobar returned from a sprained knee to score a run Monday night, and Kendrys Morales and Paulo Orlando drove in a pair each as the Royals finally figured out Kyle Gibson.	Their nemesis gave up four runs in five-plus innings after beating the Royals the first four times he faced them. Gibson (1-2) was dominant last week in a 3-1 victory at Target Field.	"Gibby didn't have his best command, four walks and a couple of wild pitches," Twins manager Paul Molitor said. "He was struggling with his feel for off-speed pitches. His last start he had a good slider and changeup. Tonight he had to battle with his fastball.	"He didn't give up a lot of hits, but had a lot of base runners with the base on balls."	Gibson also didn't have the kind of defense that Kansas City has behind him.	After first baseman Eric Hosmer threw the ball away trying to start a double play in the second inning -- helping to contribute to Minnesota's only run -- he was on the receiving end of a double-play relay to end the threat. Alex Gordon also made a diving catch in left field, and Mike Moustakas made a couple of difficult plays at third base look routine.	The Royals left the bases loaded against Gibson in the second, but they evened the score in the third. Escobar doubled to lead off the inning, went to third on Moustakas's groundout, then trotted home easily when Gibson's pitch in the dirt got away from catcher Kurt Suzuki.	The score remained deadlocked until the sixth, when the Twins' Oswaldo Arcia dropped a slicing liner from Moustakas in left field. Hosmer worked a full-count walk, and Morales hit a double down the left-field line to give Kansas City its first lead of the game.	Hosmer scored moments later on a wild pitch by reliever Blaine Boyer, and Perez added a sacrifice fly to make it 4-1 through six innings.	Morales added an insurance run in the eighth when the Twins lost track of a pop fly in shallow right field, and Orlando's two-run triple moments later put things out of reach.	Kelvin Herrera breezed through the eighth inning in relief of Volquez, and former Phillies closer Ryan Madson handled the ninth inning to wrap up the win.	"We've had a few of those games where they've had shape for a while and then things kind of broke down for us," Molitor said. "We missed the play in left and we can't contain them at the end to give ourselves a chance."	TRIPLE TROUBLE	Orlando has been a solid fill-in for OF Alex Rios, who continues to recover from a broken finger. His triple against Minnesota was his fifth in 26 at-bats.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Twins: RHP Ricky Nolasco (right elbow inflammation) is scheduled to make a rehab start Saturday for Class A Cedar Rapids. He threw off a mound Sunday with no problems.	Royals: 2B Omar Infante was feeling better after straining his left groin Sunday. Manager Ned Yost said the positive news put a hold on any plans to place him on the DL.	UP NEXT	Twins: LHP Tommy Milone (2-0) went 5 1/3 innings to beat the Royals last Thursday.	Royals: LHP Jason Vargas (1-1) allowed 10 hits and five runs in three innings against the Twins last Thursday. It was his shortest start since 2011.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

The Associated Press	DENVER --  Odrismar Despaigne turned in another impressive start, but his first major league hit brought the biggest cheers from his San Diego teammates.	It also means a new wardrobe for the young right-hander.	Despaigne pitched strong into the seventh inning, Matt Kemp had three hits and four RBIs and the San Diego Padres scored nine runs in the first two innings of a 14-3 rout of the Colorado Rockies on Monday night.	Derek Norris had three of San Diego's 17 hits and Will Venable homered to help the Padres win for the fifth time in six games.	"This lineup is capable of doing that at any ballpark," shortstop Clint Barmes said.	For the second time this season every Padres starter got a hit, including Despaigne (2-0), who led off the third with a single. It was more than enough for the Cuban right-hander, who allowed just two runs on six hits in 6 2/3 innings.	But his teammates celebrated when Despaigne led off the third with a sharp single to right.	"Our bench went crazy," manager Bud Black said. "He's such a likable guy on our team."	The single also earned Despaigne a new set of clothes from the staff. He said his fellow pitchers told him if he got his first hit at Coors Field they would take him shopping.	"They're going to take (me) shopping and buy whatever I want," Despaigne said through translator and first base coach Jose Valentin.	The game was well in hand when Despaigne got his hit. Rockies starter Jorge De La Rosa struggled in his 2015 debut, lasting two innings. The left-hander missed the first two weeks of the season with a left groin strain and was activated from the disabled list before the game.	He didn't have his usual sharpness at Coors Field, where he has a 45-15 career mark.	"I was overthrowing a lot," De La Rosa said. "I was trying to throw as hard as I can but you can't make outs if you don't have command."	San Diego scored nine runs in the first two innings to spoil De La Rosa's season debut. The first four Padres batters got hits, and Yonder Alonso's two-run single capped the their best first inning since scoring five at Cincinnati on July 29, 2009.	Will Middlebrooks' two-run triple highlighted a four-run second that ended De La Rosa's night.	De La Rosa (0-1) allowed nine runs -- seven earned -- on nine hits for his worst outing in seven years. The Rockies have lost four straight after beginning the season winning seven of their first nine.	"Yeah, he got ambushed there," Rockies manager Walt Weiss said.	Colorado scored twice in the fourth but San Diego answered with five more runs in the fifth -- two on Venable's second homer of the season -- to go up 14-2.	It's the fifth time since 2000 the Padres have scored five or more runs in two innings of the same game, with three of those at Colorado.	LINE OF FIRE	Despaigne was knocked around, too, but his issues were comebackers off Colorado bats. Carlos Gonzalez led off the second with a grounder that went off the pitcher's left calf, but Despaigne was able to pick up the ball and throw him out.	Three batters later, Nick Hundley's line drive hit Despaigne in the chest, but he stayed in the game.	"Those balls were bullets," Black said. "He's a tough kid and he came out of it fine."	AILING ALL-STAR	Rockies 3B Nolan Arenado was a late scratch because of a sore left wrist. He said it was bothering him the last few days and the discomfort increased during batting practice.	"It kind of hurt a little bit (to swing the bat) so they just scratched me for the day," Arenado said. "I think I'll be fine (Tuesday). If not it should only be a couple days. It shouldn't be long."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: RHP Ian Kennedy threw 81 pitches in an extended spring training game on Monday. Kennedy, who was put on the 15-day disabled list with a hamstring injury on April 10, will rejoin the team Tuesday in Denver. He is eligible to come off the DL on Saturday.	Rockies: LF Corey Dickerson left the game after grounding out to end the third inning. "Dickerson has been dealing with some plantar fasciitis," Weiss said. "When he came out of the box that thing bit him."	UP NEXT	Padres: RHP Brandon Morrow (0-0) is going for his first win in his third start. He has pitched well this season, allowing just two earned runs in 14 innings, but he hasn't stuck around long enough for the win in either game.	Rockies: LHP Tyler Matzek (1-0) has a 1.80 ERA but the Padres have hit him well. In four 2014 starts against San Diego Matzek is 1/3 with a 3.67 ERA.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Dan Otero's longest relief stint in the majors proved vital for the Oakland Athletics in the opener of their four-game series with the Los Angeles Angels.	The four-year veteran right-hander got credit for the Athletics' 6-3 victory over the Angels on Monday night, allowing one hit over four innings after Stephen Vogt's three-run homer in the third had put the A's ahead to stay.	"Dan Otero single-handedly gave us a chance to win this game," Vogt said. "That's the guy we know and love. That was exactly what he needed and what everybody else needed -- to pick us up and take us out of a jam. He was some kind of on-point tonight. He had a couple of little hiccups to start the season, but no one was worried about it."	Marcus Semien also homered to help stake rookie Kendall Graveman to a 5-3 lead in his third major league start. But the right-hander lasted just three-plus innings. Manager Bob Melvin pulled him after he walked Erick Aybar and C.J. Cron to open the fourth and ran his pitch count up to 73.	"I've got to go deeper in ballgames. There's no excuses," Graveman said. "I'm getting too deep into counts, and I'm not the kind of guy who can do that. But Dan did a great job coming in behind me."	Otero (1-1) bailed out Graveman by retiring the next three batters. He has not allowed a run in 13 career appearances against the Angels, spanning 19 2/3 innings.	"I'm sure they'll get one off me soon enough," said Otero, who threw 42 pitches. "I've tried to limit my pitch count. I'd been getting away from that, trying to be too fine. But tonight I was just trying to attack guys. I was able to keep going back out there and was very fortunate."	Melvin said: "He was a life saver. I mean, it looked like it was going to be a 10-8 game, and he comes in and just shuts it down. ... We don't win the game without him."	Evan Scribner pitched a perfect eighth and Tyler Clippard got three outs for his first American League save and 35th of his career.	Angels starter Matt Shoemaker (2-1) threw 68 pitches in three-plus innings, giving up five runs and seven hits while retiring only eight of the 18 batters he faced. The right-hander had won his previous nine decisions, beginning with a three-inning relief stint against Boston in a 19-inning, 5-4 victory last Aug. 9.	Vogt, batting third in the order for the first time this season, gave the Athletics a 4-2 lead in the third with his fourth homer, following a leadoff double by Sam Fuld and an infield hit by Mark Canha.	"I've hit in every spot in the order except leadoff since I've been here with the A's," Vogt said. "And what I'm learning is that it doesn't matter where you're hitting in the order. You take care of your at-bat the same way you would in every other spot in the lineup, because we jumble things so often here."	The Angels scored an unearned run in the bottom half when Albert Pujols hit the ball to left field over Canha's head, after Mike Trout reached on Semien's fielding error at shortstop and stole second. Semien, the Athletics' No. 9 hitter, got that run back with in the fourth with a towering drive into the lower seats in the left-field corner on Shoemaker's final pitch.	It was the second time in three starts this season that Shoemaker gave up two homers -- something that happened to him only once in his 21 previous big league starts.	"There's not really much to explain, other than it was just one of those off-nights," Shoemaker said. "My stuff wasn't really working out for the best. I just tried to battle through some things, battle myself and try to execute pitches."	Oakland didn't get another hit until Eric Sogard led off the ninth with a double against Fernando Salas. Fuld drove him in with a sacrifice fly.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: RHP Jesse Hahn will be skipped one turn in the rotation to allow the blister on his middle finger to heal properly. RHP Jesse Chavez, who relieved Hahn after 65 pitches in Saturday's win at Kansas City, is penciled in to make the start instead on Thursday in the finale of this four-game series. ... 2B/OF Ben Zobrist, whose 18-game hitting streak against the Angels is the longest by any active player, sat out with an injured left knee that occurred on Sunday.	UP NEXT	Athletics: LHP Drew Pomeranz (1-1) takes the mound after giving up four runs over five innings last Tuesday in a 6-1 loss at Houston.	Angels: LHP Hector Santiago (1-1) allowed two earned runs over 23 1/3 innings in his four starts against Oakland last season. He faces an offense that has gone homerless in 322 at-bats against left-handers, dating back to last Sept. 7.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

SEATTLE --  Luis Valbuena expects to play well, even this well.	The Houston third baseman hit a pair of solo home runs, including a go-ahead shot in the eighth inning, to give the Astros a 7-5 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Monday night.	It was the Valbuena's fifth home run in the past seven games and second career multiple homer game. Since April 11, the career .229 hitter is batting .323.	"I'm not surprised," said the 29-year-old with his fourth big league team. "That's how I've worked in the cage and in the practice. That's how I work, I try to bring to the game. I try to hit ball hard every at-bat."	Valbuena, who started the scoring with a drive in the first inning, opened the eighth with a shot to right on 1-1 pitch from Danny Farquhar (0-1), the first homer allowed by and Astros reliever this season. That broke the 5-all tie.	"I was looking for a cutter. He threw me that pitch," he said. "I try to be aggressive with that pitch."	Jed Lowrie added an RBI single in the inning.	Colby Rasmus also connected, on a 2-0 pitch from starter Hisashi Iwakuma in the fifth.	Tony Sipp (1-0), who worked the seventh and eighth, picked up the victory.	The Astros had nine hits, six for extra bases.	"It's nice to have some big hits. We've got to mix in some singles here and there," Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. "We're pretty good with extra-base hits."	The Mariners had come back twice behind the middle-lineup strength of Robinson Cano, Nelson Cruz and Kyle Seager. They went a combined 6 of 12 with four doubles, three RBIs and four runs scored.	Over the last seven games, those 3-4-5 hitters have have combined to hit .452 with eight doubles, eight home runs and 21 RBIs.	"Cruz has been doing it from the get-go so thankfully me and Robbie are starting to get going," Seager said. "The impact of Cruz is huge. You can't pitch around Robbie and you have to be real careful with him."	Luke Gregerson entered the ninth knowing he had to face the trio to earn the save.	"The lineup card's there. The games going on, it's on the Jumbotron. It's hard to miss it," Gregerson said.	He induced Cano to hit back to him. Cruz flied out to right. Seager walked but Gregerson struck out Seth Smith for his third save.	"Anytime you go out there and get guys out, no matter what the situation is, it's always a positive," he said. "I'm just really happy right now the way the ball is coming out of my hand."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: SS Chris Taylor (broken right wrist) appears fully recovered and is playing for the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers.	Astros: RHP Josh Fields (strained right groin), who began the season on the DL, was expected to pitch two innings Monday for Triple-A Fresno. ... LHP Brett Oberholzer (left index finger blister) was expected to throw batting practice Monday at extended spring in Kissimmee.	UP NEXT	Mariners: RHP Taijuan Walker (0-2, 17.18) made some progress from his first start to his second. In his season opener, he allowed nine runs in 3 1/3 innings then cut it back to five runs in four innings. All three of his career victories have come against Houston, 3-0 with a 2.91 ERA.	Astros: RHP Colin McHugh (2-0, 1.54) likes Safeco Field: 2-0 with a 0.61 ERA (one run in 14 2/3 innings) with 16 strikeouts in his two career starts. In his last start at Safeco on Sept. 9, he allowed one hit in eight innings. He appears unaffected by a tender finger that limited in his opening start.	PLAYER OF THE MONTH?	Cruz had six home runs, 10 RBIs and hit .500 for the week, good enough to be named AL Player of the Week, April 13-19. "Probably player of the month. I think it would be hard pressed to beat that," Manager Lloyd McClendon said. It was Cruz's fourth career player of the week honor. Cruz, who started the season at 1 for 15, said what turned him was "just a feeling. One swing can change whatever you're feeling at the plate."	REST FOR CARTER	Astros 1B Chris Carter, mired in a 3-for-40 slump, did not start. He hit 37 home runs with 88 RBIs last season but does not have an extra-base hit or a RBI this season, with 17 strikeouts. "It takes 30 to 40 at-bats to get to a bad number and it's going to take 30 to 40 to get back out of it," Hinch said. "It's going to take more than one day for him to feel great about it." Carter entered the game in the sixth as a pinch hitter and struck out. He fanned again in the ninth.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

WASHINGTON --  Heading toward a throng of excited Washington Nationals teammates after his first game-ending homer in four years, Yunel Escobar jumped head-first toward the plate.	"He's got life to him. Teammates love him here," Nationals pitcher Gio Gonzalez said afterward. "He's just a different ballplayer."	Returning to the lineup after sitting out two games with a groin injury, Escobar drove an 89 mph fastball from former teammate Carlos Villanueva to left with two outs in the bottom of the 10th inning, lifting the Nationals to a 2-1 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals on Tuesday night.	It was the second homer of 2015 for Escobar, acquired this offseason in the deal that sent setup man Tyler Clippard to Oakland. Escobar was supposed to be Washington's starting second baseman but has been filling in at third while Anthony Rendon is on the disabled list.	"He would play anywhere we ask him to," manager Matt Williams said.	Escobar went to the plate looking for a fastball from Villanueva (1-1), the seventh pitcher for the Cardinals -- and that's just what he got.	"He ambushed me," said Villanueva, who was on the Toronto Blue Jays with Escobar in 2011-12.	Villanueva hadn't pitched since April 12 against Cincinnati.	"I don't see that being a factor," he said.	The Nationals have won five of six games to get back to .500 after starting the year 2-6. They ended the Cardinals' five-game winning streak.	After Gonzalez managed to keep the Cardinals off the scoreboard despite giving up eight hits and four walks in six innings, Aaron Barrett (2-0) earned the win by pitching the 10th. He worked around a leadoff single and stolen base by Pete Kozma -- forever associated around these parts with the Cardinals' 2012 NL Division Series Game 5 comeback.	Thanks to Bryce Harper's RBI single in the third -- when he also wound up getting doubled off base on an appeal -- the Nationals led 1-0 heading into the ninth inning, when closer Drew Storen blew the save. Matt Holliday tied the game with an RBI single, making him 4 for 4, extending his hitting streak to 12 games.	In the clubhouse later, Escobar used his phone to snap a photo of a baseball inscribed with "Walk off HR" -- the third of his career but first since April 2011.	The Cuban said he never before had employed his unusual head-first celebration, explaining through a translator: "I'm just trying to have fun."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: LHP Jaime Garcia (DL, left shoulder) is scheduled to throw a simulated game Saturday.	Nationals: 3B Rendon (sprained left knee) played three innings at extended spring training and could be headed out on a minor league rehab assignment as soon as Friday.	STATCAST	The MLB Network's broadcast of Cardinals-Nationals represented the in-game debut of Statcast tracking technology, which uses stereoscopic cameras and radar sensors to monitor elements such as a batter's exit velocity, a pitcher's spin rate and perceived velocity, an infielder's reaction time, and an outfielder's route efficiency. One example: When CF Jon Jay tracked down Zimmerman's fly in the third, Statcast showed he ran 27.3 feet, with a top speed of 17 mph. It was one of several outstanding catches by Jay.	NAVAL GRAD	The Cardinals brought up reliever Mitch Harris, a 2008 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, from Triple-A Memphis. The Hall of Fame said it believes the only Naval Academy graduate to appear in a major league game was pitcher Nemo Gaines, who made four relief appearances in 1921 with the Washington Senators. Harris did not get into Tuesday's game.	UP NEXT	Cardinals RHP John Lackey (1-0, 2.77 ERA) is one strikeout shy of 1,800 for his career heading into Wednesday's game, his first start against the Nationals since 2008, when he was a member of the Angels. He'll face Nationals RHP Doug Fister (1-0, 0.69). In 2013, they were opponents in the AL Championship Series, although never pitched against each other, as Lackey's Red Sox beat Fister's Tigers in six games.	---	Follow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at http://twitter.com/HowardFendrich	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

PHILADELPHIA --  Ryan Howard took a mighty cut, paused to admire his blast and watched the ball sail over the fence for the first time this season.	Those home runs sure don't come easy anymore for the big slugger.	Howard hit a go-ahead two-run homer, Freddy Galvis also connected to back Jerome Williams, and the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Miami Marlins 7-3 Tuesday night.	"It feels good," Howard said. "That's baseball. Sometimes the wind's blowing in, sometimes the wind's blowing out. You keep swinging, and they'll go. They'll do what they're supposed to do."	Williams (1-1) allowed three runs -- two earned -- and eight hits, striking out six in six innings.	The slumping Marlins lost their fifth straight game, falling to 3-11. Manager Mike Redmond didn't get an endorsement from owner Jeffrey Loria after meeting with him and general manager Dan Jennings before the game.	Miami starter Dan Haren (1-1) gave up four runs and four hits in six innings. Giancarlo Stanton hit a 453-foot homer for the Marlins.	"I made a couple mistakes and the few I made I didn't get away with, that's for sure," Haren said.	Coming off a 1-6 road trip, the Phillies showed some rare pop at the plate. They've hit just eight home runs in 14 games.	Howard gave the Phillies a 4-3 lead in the sixth with a drive to straightaway center. Cody Asche hit a bloop single with two outs before Howard went deep.	"You go out there, you swing, balls come off the bat and guys make play," Howard said. "Sometimes it doesn't go your way. All you can do is continue to go out there and swing, and just try to put good at-bats together."	Manager Ryne Sandberg called it "kind of a breakout game" for Howard, adding he had three quality at-bats.	Howard has been dropped from his regular spot in the lineup as the cleanup hitter to sixth or seventh. He's batting .209 with 16 strikeouts.	"I'm going up there and trying to have good at-bats," he said. "Hopefully it does turn it on, but we'll see. I'm just going to continue to try to have the same approach I had tonight and go from there."	Ben Revere hit a two-run triple in the seventh and scored on Chase Utley's sacrifice fly. Galvis lined one out to right in the second inning for a 2-0 lead.	Stanton hit a long homer into Miami's bullpen in the fourth.	Adeiny Hechavarria's RBI single tied it at 2 in the fifth. After Haren bunted into a double play, J.T Realmuto scored the go-ahead run when Dee Gordon reached on Howard's fielding error at first base.	BOUNCING BACK	Williams was coming off a rough start against the Mets in which he allowed four earned runs and 10 hits in five innings. "It was good going out there, throwing and locating pitches where they needed to be -- except for that one that went, I think, 450-something feet," Williams said. "Other than that, just pitched my game."	HOME COOKING	The Phillies are 22-15 at Citizens Bank Park since last July 24. They're only 13-25 on the road in that span.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: LF Christian Yelich was scratched from the lineup 30 minutes before first pitch because of tightness in his lower back.	Phillies: RHP Chad Billingsley missed his rehab start Monday because of a stomach illness. He's expected to make that start this week. OF Domonic Brown was 1 for 4 in a rehab start at Triple-A Lehigh Valley. Brown had been sidelined by a sore left Achilles. He's batting .118.	UP NEXT	Marlins RHP Jared Cosart (0-1, 4.76) faces Phillies lefty Cole Hamels (0-2, 5.00) on Wednesday night. Cosart was one of the prospects Philadelphia traded to Houston for Hunter Pence in 2011.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

PITTSBURGH --  The shortstop of the future and the shortstop of the present happen to be on the Chicago Cubs' roster at the same time. Yet manager Joe Maddon isn't worried. He's been around the game long enough to know these things tend to work themselves out.	Maybe Addison Russell will take over for Starlin Castro at some point. The way Castro is playing, it won't be anytime soon.	Castro went 3 for 5 with 4 RBIs, including a game-tying two-run single in the ninth, and the Cubs rallied for a 9-8 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Tuesday night.	Wellington Castillo followed Castro's big hit with an RBI groundout off Pittsburgh closer Mark Melancon (0-1) as Chicago overcame a late three-run deficit to win for the third time in four games.	"We're not going to win that game last year or the year before," Castro said. "We quit. If we were losing after seven innings we quit. Now we never quit. We play nine innings."	Edwin Jackson (1-0) picked up the victory in relief. Hector Rondon worked a perfect ninth for his third save.	Russell, called up from Triple-A Iowa earlier in the day, went 0 for 5 with three strikeouts in his major league debut. The 21-year-old also played a crisp game at second base, where he'll play at least for the time being.	"I'm just happy to get the first (game) out of the way," Russell said. "I kind of see what it's like up here. It was just my first day so I'm excited for what tomorrow brings."	Pittsburgh's Jung Ho Kang went 2 for 4 with a bases-clearing double in the seventh for the first RBIs of his career.  Starling Marte hit his fifth homer of the season for the Pirates and Francisco Cervelli added two hits and two RBIs.	The Pirates appeared to finally take control when Kang, a 27-year-old infielder who is the first position player to jump from the Korean Baseball Organization directly to the majors, smacked a double to center off Jason Motte to put Pittsburgh in front 8-5.	Castillo hit a solo homer off Tony Watson in the eighth to draw the Cubs within two and Chicago pounced on Melancon in the ninth.	Anthony Rizzo led off the inning with a single. Jorge Soler doubled and Kris Bryant walked. Castro then hit a chopper over the head of Pittsburgh third baseman Josh Harrison to tie the game. Melancon struck out Chris Coghlan but Castillo's soft grounder to second was too slow to turn a double play and the Cubs leapt in front.	"When I see Rizzo get on base and the double for Soler I said that I know we have a chance today," Castro said. "(Melancon) never threw the curve for a strike. Be ready for the cutter and the fastball."	The Cubs hadn't expected Russell to join fellow rookie Kris Bryant in the majors so soon but it changed after their platoon of second basemen struggled out of the gate. Russell, acquired as part of the trade that sent Jeff Samardzija to Oakland last summer, hit .318 in Triple-A and Maddon stressed he felt Russell was mature enough to handle the pressure.	Unlike the last few years, the Pirates aren't expecting an impact player from their farm system to arrive this season. Instead their most intriguing prospect is Kang, who hit .356 with 40 home runs in the KBO last season. Playing time has been hard to come by, though general manager Neal Huntington insisted over the weekend that Kang was better served getting spot duty in the majors than regular at bats in the minors.	The Cubs walked Marte intentionally to get to Kang in the seventh before Kang sent a ball to the wall. Pittsburgh's bullpen, a strength during its playoff runs the last two years, then gave the lead away.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: To make room for Russell on the 40-man roster, the Cubs transferred third baseman Mike Olt to the 60-day disabled list. Olt fractured his right wrist after being hit by a pitch from Colorado's Adam Ottavino on April 11.	Pirates: SS Jordy Mercer played catch during pregame but missed his second straight start after getting hit in the ribs by Milwaukee's Jeff Garza on Sunday. ... A fan struck by a foul ball behind home plate on Monday was released from the hospital after she was evaluated by doctors.	UP NEXT	Cubs RHP Jason Hammel (1-0, 5.11 ERA) makes his third start of the year as the teams play the third game of a four-game set. Hammel is 2-2 with a 4.19 ERA in four appearances at PNC Park. Vance Worley  (1-1, 5.5.84) starts for Pittsburgh. Worley is 2-0 in four career starts against the Cubs.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

TORONTO -- The way his two starts against the Toronto Blue Jays have gone, Bud Norris may want to forgo any more appearances against them this season.	Less than two weeks after lasting just three innings in the Orioles' home-opening loss to their American League East rivals, Norris was pulled after just 2 1/3 innings Tuesday night after surrendering nine earned runs.	Edwin Encarnacion smashed a pair of solo home runs and Jose Bautista added his 250th of his career to power the Blue Jays to the 13-6 win.	"This is not how I envisioned the start of my 2015 season, but this game is all built on failure and you have to learn from that and go forward," said Norris (0-2).	It was the second inning, sparked by Encarnacion's first homer, a leadoff shot, that put the Orioles in a hole, as the Blue Jays put six runs on the board.	"It hurt a lot. A six-run spot hurts everybody," Norris said. "Everybody knows coming into this ballpark it's going to be a high-scoring affair, so you try to minimize the damage as best you can."	The home run that started it landed on the batter's eye beyond center field.	Encarnacion's second, his fourth of the season, was a left-field blast into the top deck of Rogers Centre. It was just the 18th home run to climb that high in the 26-year history of the stadium.	Baltimore manager Buck Showalter singled out his team's defense as an area for concern after the loss. As for Norris, he chalked it up to a bad night.	"Command has been an issue for him, getting the ball where he needs to get it consistently and it's a situation where his track record says he's better than that and we'll trust that," said the reigning AL manager of the year.	Toronto starter Mark Buehrle (3-0) went six innings to get his second win against the Orioles this year.	Even though Encarnacion had two homers, it was Bautista's two-run shot off rookie reliever Jason Garcia that was the talk of both locker rooms afterward.	The 22-year-old had narrowly missed Bautista with the second pitch of the at-bat, and three pitches later, the Blue Jays' veteran responded by depositing the ball beyond the left-field wall, stopping to admire it before rounding the bases.	That didn't go unnoticed, and outfielder Adam Jones shouted at Bautista as he left the field.	"It's not his first, it's not a walk-off, it's in the seventh inning," Jones said. "Let's not walk halfway down the line. Respect the game. I know he does, but at that moment right there he didn't, and when it happens against my team, I'm going to take offense to it."	Unperturbed, Bautista defended his actions.	"You throw at me, I'm not going to forget and if I get you right after, I'm going to enjoy it," he said. "And I did. I have no regrets about it."	Toronto's fourth run of the second inning prompted Showalter to challenge the call that Dalton Pompey avoided the tag at the plate from catcher Caleb Joseph. The call stood.	UP NEXT	Orioles RH Ubaldo Jimenez (1-0) faces Blue Jays RH Aaron Sanchez (0-2) on Wednesday night. Over three career appearances at Toronto's Rogers Centre, including two starts, Jimenez has an earned-run average of 8.68.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: Rookie second baseman Devon Travis sat out with sore ribs after being hit by a pitch on Sunday. Outfielder Michael Saunders, on a rehab assignment with Single-A Dunedin after knee surgery during spring training, will "ideally" join the team in Tampa this weekend, said manager John Gibbons. Starter Daniel Norris underwent an MRI on his pitching arm after suffering what he termed a "dead-arm phase" following his last start on Sunday. The test revealed he had nothing more serious than fatigue.	Orioles: Shortstop J.J. Hardy, recovering from a left shoulder strain, is with Triple-A Norfolk and hit off a tee and took ground balls Tuesday, but there is no timetable for his return. According to Showalter, catcher Matt Wieters, who is rehabbing following Tommy John surgery, may catch two to three innings on Friday in Sarasota.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

DETROIT --  Nathan Eovaldi made a small adjustment before Tuesday night's start against the Detroit Tigers.	He's going to stick with it.	Eovaldi (1-0) allowed one run on eight hits and a walk in seven-plus innings to pick up his first win with the New York Yankees in a 5-2 victory over the Tigers.	"I moved my arm a little closer to my body in my last bullpen (session), and I was able to keep it there for most of the game," he said. "It really helped my command."	Eovaldi was helped by four New York double plays, one of which he started himself. With a runner on first in the second inning, Eovaldi made a blind snag of Yoenis Cespedes' line drive, then got to the tricky part of the play.	"I didn't realize how much time I had, and I almost threw the ball away," he said. "I gator-armed it, but (Mark Teixeira) saved me by digging it out."	The Tigers scored a run in the ninth when Andrew Miller walked Nick Castellanos and Rajai Davis to force in a run, but Miller struck out Jose Iglesias to pick up his fifth save.	"I need to be better than that, but it ended up with a win," Miller said. "I wasn't missing by much, so I'm not worried about it."	Kyle Lobstein (1-1) took the loss, allowing one run on three hits and four walks in six innings.	"I would like to throw more strikes than that, try and get deeper in the game," he said. "But overall I was able to make some pitches to get out of some jams."	Four Tigers relievers combined to allow three runs in the seventh, letting the Yankees pull away.	"We were pretty sloppy in that inning," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said. "You can't go 1-0 and 2-0 on every single hitter."	New York took a 1-0 lead in the first inning on Teixeira's RBI double, but the game quickly turned into a duel between Lobstein and Eovaldi.	The Yankees added a pair of insurance runs with a pair of solo homers in the seventh. Chris Young led off with his fourth off Ian Krol's 3-1 pitch, and Stephen Drew hit a 2-0 pitch for his fourth two batters later.	Later in the seventh, Jacoby Ellsbury scored on a wild pitch by Al Alburquerque, Detroit's third pitcher of the inning.	Detroit made it 4-1 in the bottom of the inning on Cespedes' sacrifice fly.	Alex Rodriguez nearly hit his 659th career homer in the ninth, but Cespedes made the catch at the wall in left-centerfield. Two batters later, Castellanos' error allowed Brett Gardner to score New York's fifth run.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: LHP Chris Capuano (right quadriceps) is scheduled to throw two innings Wednesday in his first extended spring training game and could return in mid-May. ... RHP Ivan Nova (right elbow surgery), who appears on target to be back in June, threw 35 pitches broken down into two segments in his third batting practice session and will have a simulated game Friday. ... INF Brendan Ryan (calf) has resumed taking batting practice and fielding grounders.	Tigers: RHP Joe Nathan (flexor strain) is scheduled to make a rehab appearance for Triple-A Toledo on Wednesday. If all goes well, Nathan hopes to be activated from the disabled list as soon as Friday. . Ausmus said there is no timetable for RHP Justin Verlander (triceps strain) to resume throwing.	UP NEXT:	Yankees: Adam Warren (0-1, 4.82 ERA) will face Detroit in the third game of the four-game series on Wednesday night. Warren is 1-0 with a 1.69 ERA in four relief outings against the Tigers.	Tigers: David Price (1-0, 0.40 ERA) goes against the Yankees Wednesday night for the 27th time in his career, including 26 starts. Price is 10-6 against New York with a 4.03 ERA, his second highest against any American League team (5.37 vs Texas).	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK --  Catcher Kevin Plawecki trotted onto the field, shook hands with umpire crew chief Jerry Meals and promptly bounced a practice throw down to second base.	"A little bit nervous," Plawecki said.	Maybe, but it never showed in his big league debut. Plawecki contributed with his bat and glove as the banged-up New York Mets won their ninth straight game, beating the Atlanta Braves 7-1 on Tuesday night.	A highly regarded prospect, Plawecki got two hits, scored twice and threw out a runner trying to advance on a ball in the dirt.	"Just happy to have the first one out of the way," he said. "Just happy it came out the way it did."	The Mets extended their longest winning streak since a 10-game run in 2008. The team record is 11, last done in 1990.	Curtis Granderson drove in his first four runs of the season and Jonathon Niese (2-0) pitched shutout ball into the seventh inning, helping the Mets stretch the best home start in club history to 8-0 at Citi Field.	"We've got good players. We've got good players coming," manager Terry Collins said.	Plawecki was promoted from Triple-A earlier in the day to replace catcher Travis d'Arnaud, out for at least three weeks after breaking a finger when he was hit by a pitch Sunday. The Mets lost reliever Jerry Blevins to a broken forearm in the same game, and are still minus injured third baseman David Wright.	D'Arnaud took Plawecki out for dinner during Monday's day off, telling the 24-year-old minor leaguer that he was ready for the majors. D'Arnaud often talked to Plawecki during the game, offering encouragement.	Plawecki, drafted by the Mets in 2012 from Purdue with a compensation pick they got for losing Jose Reyes to free agency, did more than fine in front of a rooting section that included his parents, his fiance, college and high school teammates and former coaches.	Mom Lynne and dad Jeff made the trip from Westfield, Indiana, in the morning. Watching her son, she said, it was easy to flash back in her mind "to him as a 4-year-old boy, hitting balls in the driveway."	The souvenir ball from Plawecki's first hit was in his locker, and headed to his parents.	"From the time he could walk, all he wanted to do was hit balls," his dad said.	Plawecki lined out in his first at-bat, and later admitted he was just hoping to make contact. He grounded a single to left field for his first hit and fueled the big fifth, scoring on Granderson's two-run single.	In the sixth, Plawecki pounced on a pitch that bounced away and threw out Andrelton Simmons at second. Plawecki singled again in the eighth and scored on a double by Granderson, his first extra-base hit this year.	"Good for him. Got a couple hits and made a nice play on a ball in the dirt and threw out Simmons at second," Atlanta manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "We've heard a lot of good stuff about him with the bat and he proved that he could swing it a little bit."	The Braves, meanwhile, hurt themselves. They had made only one error in their first 12 games before committing two -- second baseman Phil Gosselin fumbled a potential double-play grounder by Niese, keying a four-run burst in the fifth inning.	Niese blanked the Braves until his 100th pitch, which Cameron Maybin hit for a two-out home run in the seventh. Umpires originally held Maybin at second base, then let him trot home after a replay review.	Mets reliever Alex Torres ended the seventh with a 5-1 lead by striking out Freddie Freeman with two runners on, the third time the Atlanta cleanup man fanned.	Niese gave up four hits, struck out five and walked four.	Trevor Cahill (0-2) was chased in the fifth. He has lost six straight decisions dating to last season with Arizona.	---	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: Wright (pulled hamstring) is "advancing" in his recovery and is expected to begin baseball activities soon, Collins said. ... Closer Bobby Parnell (Tommy John surgery) gave up two hits and walked two while getting only two outs for Class A St. Lucie.	BAGGAGE	The game was delayed for a few minutes in the middle of the seventh inning because second base seemed to shake loose from its mooring. A groundskeeper helped get the bag anchored down.	UP NEXT	Braves: Eric Stults is 0-1 with a 6.30 ERA in two starts. Signed as a free agent before spring training, the 35-year-old lefty was 8-17 for San Diego last season.	Mets: RHP Dillon Gee (0-1) has made 48 straight starts of at least five innings dating to May 2013, the longest active streak in the majors. The team record is 50 by Dwight Gooden.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Wade Miley pitched well into the sixth inning before the Boston bullpen protected his stellar effort.	Miley and four relievers combined on a four-hitter and the Red Sox took advantage of an error to beat Chris Archer and the Tampa Bay Rays 1-0 on Tuesday night.	Miley (1-1) gave up three hits, four walks and had three strikeouts over 5 2/3 innings. Alexi Ogando, Robbie Ross Jr., and Junichi Tazawa combined to retire seven straight batters before Koji Uehara allowed a leadoff single in the ninth before finishing for his second save.	"He was down in the strike zone pretty consistently throughout the time on the mound," Boston manager John Farrell said of Miley. "The guys coming out of the bullpen did an absolutely outstanding job."	Archer (2-2) allowed one unearned run and seven hits in 5 2/3 innings for the Rays, who have lost the first four games of a nine-game homestand. He struck out nine and walked one.	Archer had his scoreless streak end at 16 innings when second baseman Ryan Brett was charged with an error for a wild throw to first on a potential inning-ending double play grounder by Dustin Pedroia that allowed Ryan Hanigan to score.	Mookie Betts' slide into second base helped disrupt Brett's throw.	"It's things we've talked about," Betts said. "That was my chance to put it into play. Nothing dirty, just trying to break up the double play and it worked out that time."	Brett called Betts' slide a hustle play.	"I've got to give credit to him," Brett said.	Boston has scored 19 unearned runs this season.	Ogando replaced Miley with the bases loaded and two outs in the sixth, and got a grounder from Desmond Jennings.	"That's huge," Miley said. "You absolutely put your confidence in the bullpen."	Miley has won all three starts against the Rays, allowing one earned run in 19 innings.	Brett got the Rays' first hit, an infield single in the third in his first major league start. The rookie got picked off first and departed with an injured left shoulder, which was sore after the game and will be re-examined Wednesday.	Boston designated hitter David Ortiz played after appealing a one-game suspension for making contact with umpire John Tumpane during the fifth inning of Sunday's game against Baltimore and went 0 for 3 with a walk.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: LF Hanley Ramirez was in the lineup after leaving Monday's game due to illness.	Rays: 1B James Loney (right oblique) could return this week. ... RHP Alex Cobb (right forearm) may have his first bullpen session late this week. ... Closer Jake McGee (elbow surgery) had his rehab assignment delayed by general body soreness. ... LHP Drew Smyly (left shoulder) might rejoin the rotation as soon as Friday.	MORE MILEY	Miley stumbled to the ground twice after delivering a pitch. In the sixth, Farrell and a trainer went to the mound to check on Miley, who was OK.	"That's me not being athletic at all," Miley said with a smile. "I'm completely fine."	HOME WOES	The Rays are 1-6 at home this season, compared to 5-2 on the road. The Rays have been shut out twice at home. Since June 2, Tampa Bay's home mark is 25-37.	UP NEXT	Red Sox: RHP Joe Kelly (1-0, 2.13 ERA) will face the Rays for the first time Wednesday night. He is 3-0 with a 2.70 ERA in four starts against the AL East teams.	Rays: RHP Nathan Karns (1-1, 4.58 ERA), Wednesday night's starter, has allowed 11 homers in 41 2/3 career innings.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CHICAGO -- On a cold night in Chicago, Carlos Carrasco worked an efficient five innings in his first start since being smacked in the face with a line drive against these same White Sox.	The Cleveland Indians bullpen took it from there in a 6-2 win Tuesday at U.S. Cellular Field, where the temperatures slipped into the lower 40s with wind chills in the 30s.	"I felt a little bit tight, so they took me out," said Carrasco who went seven days between starts. "I missed a week or something like that, so they wanted to take care of it and they did the right move."	Carrasco struck out eight and allowed just one run on four hits, while Carlos Santana and David Murphy hit solo home runs and the Indians snapped a two-game losing streak.	"I thought he pitched really well," said Indians manager Terry Francona. "I thought he used his off speed especially well tonight. (He) located real well, worked ahead and I thought he did a real good job.	"But it was so cold and he was tight and it was taking him a little more each inning to get loose," Francona said. "The last thing we needed to go was have somebody go an inning or two too long."	Still, Carrasco (2-1) looked strong a week after outfielder Melky Cabrera's liner struck him in the first inning of a 4-1 loss last Tuesday. The right hander improved to 1-1 against Chicago this season.	White Sox starter Hector Noesi (0-2) lasted 5 2/3 innings and departed with runners on first and third for Carlos Rodon, who was making his major league debut.	Rodon gave up a two-run single to pinch hitter Ryan Raburn in the sixth and allowed two more runs in the seventh.	Seven Cleveland pitchers combined for 15 strikeouts.	Chicago's first run came on first baseman Jose Abreu's fourth home run.	Santana replied with a leadoff homer to right in the second for a 1-1 tie. His third home run of the season came on a full count.	Murphy added a solo shot to right for a 2-1 Indians lead in the fifth.	Cleveland made it 4-1 when Rodon loaded the bases with a walk to Brandon Moss. Raburn then lined a two-run, pinch-hit single to left to score Jason Kipnis and Michael Brantley.	Rodon also struggled in the seventh as the Indians opened a 6-1 lead.	"I threw all over the place but finally found some command," Rodon said. "Maybe a little overthrowing. There's no excuses. You've got to be good in that situation."	Rodon worked 2 1/3 innings, giving up three hits, two earned runs, three walks and a strikeout.	The Indians retired 15 of 16 White Sox batters between the third and eighth, when Adam Eaton singled with two out as Chicago mounted its most serious threat.	LONELY HOMERS	All 11 Cleveland home runs have been solo shots and all have come on the road this season. The Indians had Monday home runs from Ryan Raburn and Brett Hayes and the pair Tuesday from Santana and Murphy.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: INF Zach Walters (oblique strain) is set to play make a rehab appearance Wednesday at Triple-A Columbus while 1B Nick Swisher (knee surgery) reports on Thursday as both seek to come off the disabled list. "Zach's healthy, he's ready to go," Indians manager Terry Francona said. "Swish is still trying got build up to game speed."	White Sox: RHP Jake Petricka didn't make an appearance in his second game back since being re-instated from the 15-day disabled list (right forearm strain) on Monday.	UP NEXT: White Sox RHP Jeff Samardzija (0-1, 4.29 ERA) makes his fourth start in Wednesday's series finale. He had no decision in an eight-inning, one-run effort against the Tigers on April 17. Samardzija is 1-1 in six all-time starts against Cleveland. RHP Corey Kluber (0-1, 2.84 ERA) makes his fourth start. He had a no decision in a 3-2 loss on April 17 at Minnesota. The 2014 AL Cy Young Award winner is 2-1 in 10 appearances against Chicago.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Ned Yost stuck by Mike Moustakas when just about everyone else had given up on him, dutifully penciling him into the Royals' starting lineup at third base despite all of his slumps.	Finally, the Kansas City manager is feeling vindicated.	Moustakas hit an early two-run homer, then drove in the go-ahead run with a single in the eighth inning, as the Royals rallied to beat the Minnesota Twins 6-5 on Tuesday night.	"You almost want to stand up on this table and yell, `I told you so!" Yost said, flashing a wry grin. "But I'm not. I'm not an I-told-you-so kind of guy."	The Royals trailed 5-3 in the sixth when Christian Colon started their comeback with an RBI double. Colon added a run-scoring groundout off Casey Fien (0-1) in the eighth to knot the game, and Moustakas fileted a single to left off Glen Perkins to take the lead.	It was the kind of opposite-field hit that Moustakas struggled to deliver a year ago.	"Just looking for a fastball. He was throwing a bunch of fastballs," Moustakas said of Perkins, the Twins' left-handed closer. "I was able to fight that one to left field."	Chris Young (1-0) pitched two scoreless innings in relief of Jason Vargas, and Wade Davis breezed through the Twins in the ninth for his third save of the season.	Davis has been closing games with All-Star reliever Greg Holland on the disabled list.	Joe Mauer drove in a run in the second for Minnesota, and Trevor Plouffe, Oswaldo Arcia, Kurt Suzuki and Shane Robinson had run-scoring singles in the sixth inning.	Alex Gordon also went deep for the Royals (11-3), who have taken the first two games of the three-game set after losing their only series of the season in Minnesota last week.	The Royals are off to their best start since 2003, and have won eight of their first nine at home. They also improved to 16-5 in their last 21 against the Twins at Kauffman Stadium.	Minnesota dropped to 1-7 on the road this season.	Gordon's solo shot to right staked the Royals to the lead in the second inning, but the Twins quickly answered in the fourth off Vargas with three consecutive singles.	Kansas City pulled back ahead in the fifth. Colon led off with a single, and Moustakas just managed to coax a fly ball over the right-field wall for a two-run homer.	Dancing with trouble throughout the night, Vargas finally got bogged down in the sixth inning. The left-hander got the first two outs thanks in part to catching Mauer in a run-down between third and home, but then gave up consecutive two-out RBI singles.	Royals manager Ned Yost lifted him for reliever Jason Frasor, and he gave up two more two-out singles -- none of the four were particularly hard-hit -- that gave Minnesota a 5-3 lead.	Colon drove in a run with a two-out double in the bottom half to start the Kansas City rally, but Twins reliever Blaine Boyer managed to retire Alcides Escobar to leave the tying run on third.	Kansas City also left the bases loaded in the third and a runner on second in the fifth, but managed to come through when the game was on the line in the final innings.	"A loss always hurts," Fien said. "When I don't my job that's what happens."	STARTING TROUBLE	Vargas allowed five runs on eight hits and a walk, while Twins counterpart Tommy Milone gave up four runs on five hits and four walks. Both lasted 5 2/3 innings. "Walks in general are just no good," Milone said. "It seems usually to bite you in the butt."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Twins: Suzuki started at catcher despite taking a hard foul ball off his shin courtesy of Arcia while standing in the on-deck circle during Monday night's game.	Royals: 2B Omar Infante (groin strain) took grounders and hit soft toss before the game, and Yost said he could have been used in an emergency situation.	UP NEXT	Twins: RHP Mike Pelfrey (0-0) is 0-2 with a 9.49 ERA against the Royals.	Royals: RHP Jeremy Guthrie (1-0) has won his last four regular-season decisions.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

MILWAUKEE -- With the ways balls were flying around Miller Park, Tuesday night's meeting between the Cincinnati Reds and Milwaukee Brewers felt more like a weekend rec league softball game.	The Reds had more punch and capitalized on Milwaukee mistakes.	Jay Bruce and Todd Frazier each hit two-out grand slams, and Zack Cozart added two homers to power Cincinnati to a 16-10 victory.	"It was one of those games that just didn't seem like it was going to end. Our offense came through," Frazier said.	The Reds offense has reawakened for 22 runs in two games in Milwaukee -- coming after manager Bryan Price went on a profanity-laced tirade in his pregame media session Monday.	Mike Fiers (0-3) was shelled for eight runs in four innings for Milwaukee, which lost its seventh straight. The Brewers have the worst record in the majors at 2-12.	For a change, the offense wasn't the main problem for the Brewers. They broke out for their highest-scoring game of the season despite a lineup littered with backups because of injuries.	"It's just a shame you score 10 runs and aren't even close to winning the game," manager Ron Roenicke said. "But real good job by a lot of the guys offensively. We'll just see if we can get a good outing pitching and see if we can continue the offense."	Elian Herrera, called up on earlier in the day, hit a grand slam in the sixth to get the Brewers to 13-10.	But the pitching staff just couldn't contain the Reds' bats. Cozart led off the top of the seventh with a solo shot.	"For us to score 10 there and not even be close to winning, I can't really explain it," Fiers said.	Jason Marquis (1-1) got the win despite giving up nine hits and five runs in five innings. He had eight strikeouts.	SLAM DUNK	It was the fourth time in major league history that two teams combined for three grand slams, and the first since the Yankees hit three slams against Oakland on Aug. 25, 2011.	Reds first base coach Billy Hatcher was involved in one of the other games, hitting a grand slam for Houston in a 22-7 loss to the Cubs on June 3, 1987. It was the last time there were three grand slams in a game in which both teams hit at least one, according to STATS.	"You have some guys who never hit one and I'm talking about some of your best hitters," Hatcher said. "To see three in one game is crazy."	HOMER HAPPY	The teams combined for seven homers, including five for Cincinnati.	Eight-place hitter Cozart now has three homers in two games and four on the season -- matching his output for all of 2014.	But the middle of the order set the tone at the plate.	Frazier's homer in the fourth to left off Fiers made it 8-4, answering a four-run rally the previous inning by Milwaukee.	MISTAKE PRONE	Jason Rogers had two throwing errors at third for the Brewers. The first error off Brandon Phillips' bouncer in the third inning proved especially costly after the next batter, Bruce, hit his fourth career grand slam to open the scoring.	"Anyone will tell you, they love managing a game when you're up eight or 10 but we had a hard time keeping it up there tonight. Thank goodness we were able to lock it down," Price said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: C Devin Mesoraco made his first appearance since coming off the bench on April 12 against St. Louis. Mesoraco has been dealing with a sore hip. He walked as a pinch hitter in the seventh and scored a run.	Brewers: Roenicke said C Jonathan Lucroy could miss four to six weeks with a broken left toe. He got hurt on Monday. ... Scooter Gennett went on the DL on Tuesday after the second baseman cut his hand in the shower on Sunday in Pittsburgh. Herrera was called up from Triple-A to replace him on the roster.	UP NEXT	Reds: Johnny Cueto (0-2) hopes the offensive revival continues for his start on Wednesday. The 22 runs combined over the two straight victories exceeded the team's 19-run output during a 1-7 stretch preceding the trip to Milwaukee.	Brewers: Jimmy Nelson (1-1) is as close as the struggling Brewers have to a stopper these days. Milwaukee starting pitching had an ERA of 5.96 entering Tuesday, the worst in the majors.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

The Associated Press	DENVER --  Matt Kemp and the San Diego Padres are mastering the come-from-behind victory in the first month of the season.	Derek Norris hit a tiebreaking, two-run double in the eighth inning and the San Diego Padres rallied to beat the Colorado Rockies 7-6 on Tuesday night.	Clint Barmes homered and Wil Myers had three hits for San Diego, which has won three straight and six of seven.	The Padres are 10-5 for the first time since 1998, which is also the last time they reached the World Series. They've come from behind in six wins.	"I'm real proud of this team," Kemp said. "Every game I think we've been behind and we have at least fought to get back in the game. It shows the character of our team that no teams can take us lightly. We're always going to stay in it and try to win games."	Nick Hundley hit his first homer as a Rockie and also tripled. Colorado has lost five straight after starting the season 7-2.	The struggling Rockies used a three-run fifth to take a 5-2 lead but the bullpen couldn't hold it. The Padres got one in the seventh and then went up in the eighth.	Pinch-hitter Yangervis Solarte singled home a run, and after a failed safety squeeze left runners at first and second with two outs, Myers tied it with a single. Norris, who had two hits, followed with a two-run double off Boone Logan (0-1) to give the Padres a 7-5 lead.	"Derek's ball to right-center was big," San Diego manager Bud Black said. "Great swing, great at-bat. He's got that in his game."	Norris had two doubles for the second straight game.	Hundley led off the ninth with a home run off Craig Kimbrel, but the righty retired the next three batters for his fifth save.	Brandon Maurer (1-0) pitched a scoreless seventh inning to get the win.	Charlie Blackmon had a two-run triple for Colorado.	"We're playing good teams but we haven't played well," Hundley said. "The first 10 games of the season we were making a lot of plays and playing good defense. We'll get back to that."	Barmes led off the third with his first home run since Sept. 11, 2013, to put San Diego ahead. Kemp's RBI double later in the inning made it 2-0.	The Rockies tied it in the fourth on a triple by Hundley and a groundout by D.J. LeMahieu.	San Diego was poised to break it open in the fifth when Colorado's defense bailed out starter Tyler Matzek. After the first two batters walked, Myers singled to right and Barmes was tagged out in a rundown between third and home.	Rafael Ynoa's error at third loaded the bases but Matzek got Kemp to ground into an inning-ending double play.	THE DEFENSE RESTS	Kemp silenced anyone critical of the Padres' defense with a diving catch on Hundley's drive leading off the seventh. Kemp laid out to glove the ball that was headed for extra bases and helped keep the game close.	"I got a pretty good jump on the ball," Kemp said. "Just made an effort and got to it."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: RHP Ian Kennedy joined the team in Denver on Tuesday and is on track to come off the 15-day DL when he's eligible Saturday. Manager Bud Black said he didn't talk to Kennedy before batting practice Tuesday but did say "he's ready," after throwing 81 pitches in an extended spring training game Monday.	Rockies: 3B Nolan Arenado (left wrist) and OF Corey Dickerson (left plantar faciitis) were both out of the starting lineup Tuesday. Arenado said his sore left wrist felt better after taking swings off the tee. Dickerson has been bothered by the plantar faciitis since spring training but he doesn't think it's serious. He pinch-hit in the ninth.	UP NEXT	Padres: RHP James Shields (2-0) will try to continue his strong start with his new team. Shields entered Tuesday with 24 strikeouts in three starts, which was tied for fourth in the NL. He has pitched at least six innings in each of his three starts.	Rockies: RHP Kyle Kendrick (1-2) had an impressive start on opening day but struggled in his next two starts. He allowed a career-high eight earned runs against the Cubs on April 11 in his first Coors Field start as a Rockie. He was roughed up for six runs against the Dodgers on Saturday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PHOENIX --  Already off to a solid start this season, Prince Fielder showed his power Tuesday night.	Fielder hit his first home run in almost a year and drove in three runs to lead the Texas Rangers to a 7-1 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks.	Fielder, who had an RBI double in the first inning, took reliever Daniel Hudson (0-1) deep into the seats in right field in the eighth after a pair of errors allowed the Rangers to break a 1-1 tie.	"Just trying to get them in and get a pitch I can drive," Fielder said. "It's fine, as long as I get the runs in."	Jake Smolinski reached base with one out on a fielding error by third baseman Cliff Pennington and scored on a single by Elvis Andrus. Andrus had been 1 for 17 with runners in scoring position prior to that at-bat.	The Rangers then tried a double steal with Fielder at the plate, and Arizona catcher Tuffy Gosewich threw the ball into left field for an error, allowing Leonys Martin to score to make it 3-1. Fielder followed with his home run, the first since May 8 of last year.	Fielder is a .303 hitter at Chase Field with 11 home runs and 25 RBIs in 44 career games. He's batting .386 this season.	"It's nice. The batter's eye is good," Fielder said of hitting at the Diamondbacks' park.	Hudson had not allowed any runs in his first four appearances this season.	"That was probably my fault. I probably should have gotten Hudson out there a little sooner," Diamondbacks manager Chip Hale said. "He has been throwing the ball so well for us with his fastball, change-up combination. He just didn't have it tonight."	Martin added a two-run single in the ninth for the last runs.	Reliever Shawn Tolleson (1-0) struck out three of the four batters he faced to pick up the win.	"One thing he's not, he's not afraid," Rangers manager Jeff Banister said. "He's been able to execute his pitches well this season.	Both starters pitched well while ending up with no-decsions. Arizona's Chase Anderson gave up a run on three hits with five strikeouts in a career high-tying seven innings. Texas' Nick Martinez allowed a run and five hits with three strikeouts and a walk in six innings.	"Solid outing for Nick. Moved the fastball around. Pitched inside. Got some early outs when he needed them," Banister said.	The Diamondbacks tied it in the second when rookie Yasmany Tomas scored on a grounder by Nick Ahmed.	TOMAS' EVENTFUL FIRST START	Tomas was in the starting lineup for the first time in his major-league career. The Cuban native, called up last week, got his chance at third base with Jake Lamb injured and Aaron Hill on the bench. Tomas singled in his first at-bat, his first hit at Chase Field, but missed a ground ball hit to him for an error in third inning.	He also legged out an infield hit in the sixth to load the bases before being removed for a pinch runner.	"We know what we have," Hale said of Tomas. "We know he can hit. We just need to find some at-bats for him."	Tomas bumped Gosewich out of the way when the two were going for a foul pop near the Diamondbacks' dugout, but made the catch to end the top of the fifth. He got a smile and a high-five from Gosewich in the dugout after the play.	"The injury to Lamb as is not good for the team," Tomas said through a translator. "I am going to be ready for any responsibility, when they give it to me."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: The Diamondbacks placed Lamb on the 15-day disabled list before Tuesday's game with a left foot stress reaction. Lamb was off to a strong start, going 12 for 29 with nine RBIs in 10 games. INF Danny Dorn was called up from Triple-A Reno and C Gerald Laird was transferred to the 60-day disabled list after back surgery. Dorn, 30, made his major-league debut when he pinch hit in the seventh. Laird played in one game before undergoing surgery on Monday.	Pitchers Patrick Corbin and David Hernandez, both coming off of arm surgery in 2014, were scheduled for simulated games on Tuesday.	UP NEXT	Rangers: Yovani Gallardo (2-1, 3.45 ERA) makes his fourth start of the season. Gallardo has won back-to-back starts after losses in six straight decisions from Aug. 22, 2014 to April 6 of this year.	Diamondbacks: Rookie Archie Bradley makes his third career start. He's 1-0 with a 1.42 ERA and was the first pitcher in baseball history to start opposite the reigning Cy Young Award winner (Clayton Kershaw) and the World Series MVP (Madison Bumgarner) in his first two major league games.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  The Los Angeles Angels had a pretty easy time against Oakland pitching -- until they faced first baseman Ike Davis.	Johnny Giavotella hit a three-run homer, his first for the Angels after the second inning was extended by a replay review, and the defending AL West champions routed the Athletics 14-1 Tuesday night to end a three-game skid.	Giavotella had a career-high four RBIs and Kole Calhoun tied a career-best with four hits, including a three-run homer. Giavotella was acquired in a trade from Kansas City in December and won the second base job in spring training after Howie Kendrick was dealt to the Dodgers.	"It feels great helping this team win," said Giavotella, who also had an RBI single. "From day one in spring training, this team has welcomed me with open arms. They believe in me, and it's great to have guys that rally around you and root for you on the bench."	Davis, the son of former Yankees pitcher Ron Davis, retired Collin Cowgill, C.J. Cron and Chris Iannetta with groundballs and threw only nine pitches. Instead of warming up in the bullpen, the left-hander did it in the indoor batting cage after volunteering to manager Bob Melvin.	"It was interesting for sure," said Davis, who had a 2.25 ERA at Arizona State. "I'm just glad I threw strikes and didn't have to throw too many pitches. I miss that part of the game, and I've always wanted to get back up there and see what I could do and if I could get outs. I was a little nervous. I didn't want to walk the house and look like a clown out there."	It was the first time the A's had a position player pitch since Frank Menechino on July 18, 2000, against the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field.	"You never like facing a guy like that because it's a lose-lose situation," Cron said. "I got a good pitch to hit, but I hit it right into the ground. He got three outs, so he did his job. He pitched in college, so he knows what he's doing."	Hector Santiago (2-1) allowed a run and three hits in six innings and struck out eight.	Drew Pomeranz (1-2) gave up five runs -- four earned -- and eight hits in five-plus innings and fanned six.	The left-hander thought he was out of the second inning unscathed, after third baseman Brett Lawrie charged Cron's slow bouncer up the line and got the force at second on Erick Aybar before Eric Sogard relayed to first. Cron was called out by umpire Mike Muchlinski, but Angels manager Mike Scioscia asked the crew to take a second look and Cron was declared safe.	"I felt like (Muchlinski) took a little bit of time, and then I saw him call me out -- but I knew I was safe for sure," Cron said. "Then we got something going there."	Pomeranz ended up making 25 extra pitches that inning and gave up four runs before getting the third out. Giavotella homered on a full count.	"One of the things we do well is see a lot of pitches. We battle and don't give in with two strikes," Giavotella said.	Calhoun then singled, Mike Trout walked on four pitches, and Calhoun scored the fourth run when shortstop Marcus Semien misplayed Albert Pujols' grounder for his fifth error in 15 games.	Billy Butler got the A's on the board in the third with a two-out homer, their last hit until Mark Canta's one-out infield single in the eighth.	But Pomeranz was charged with another run after Cron chased him with a leadoff double during a six-run sixth that included three errors by the A's, two wild pitches by R.J. Alvarez, and increased the Angels' lead to 10-1.	"We obviously didn't play a clean game," Melvin said. "We've been on the other side of blowouts this year, and it doesn't feel that great when you're on the side we were tonight. It was just a bad game all the way around. At least we got a little levity at the end there with Ike."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: 2B-OF Ben Zobrist missed his second straight game because of an injured left knee.	Angels: Scioscia said OF Josh Hamilton (shoulder) is close to beginning an extended spring program in Arizona.	UP NEXT	Athletics: RHP Sonny Gray (1-0) faced the Angels in three of his final eight starts last season, going at least seven innings each time. He is coming off a no-decision at Kansas City in which he gave up four runs and 11 hits over six innings.	Angels: RHP Jered Weaver (0-2) had a 6.61 ERA in his first three outings. The 10-year veteran and me All-Star, who won 18 games last year, has never gone winless in his first four starts of a major league season.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

SEATTLE --  Collin McHugh continued to linger, never getting knocked around enough to where his night needed to end, even if it felt as if there were constantly runners on base.	That grinding effort by Houston's young rising star pitcher was eventually rewarded by Jose Altuve, who hit a go-ahead three-run double in the eighth inning that gave the Astros a 6-3 win over the Seattle Mariners on Tuesday.	McHugh was far from his best. But Altuve's clutch hit -- coming on an 0-2 pitch -- helped McHugh win his 10th straight decision.	"It was a battle for seven innings and our guys picked me up every way they could," McHugh said.	Down 3-1 entering the eighth, the Astros scored five times against the Mariners bullpen, capped by Altuve's bases-clearing liner into the left-field corner for their fourth straight victory. Altuve had been hitless in his previous eight at-bats.	The rally made a surprise winner out of McHugh (3-0) and continued the longest winning streak by a Houston pitcher since Wade Miller won 12 straight decisions during the 2002 season. McHugh gave up three runs, but pitched through the seventh and stayed in the game long enough for the Astros to rally.	McHugh's seven innings were a season high, but he was far from sharp early. The three earned runs were also a season high and he struck out only three batters after striking out 11 in his last start against Oakland. The three strikeouts for McHugh were the fewest in his previous seven starts.	"I don't put a whole lot of an emphasis on the winning streak but tonight was big," McHugh said. "To be able to battle through some innings was tough."	Chad Qualls pitched the ninth for his first save this season.	McHugh's streak continued thanks to a rally that started because of an error committed by Seattle's Robinson Cano mishandling pinch-hitter Robbie Grossman's grounder leading off the eighth. Marwin Gonzalez followed with a base hit that eluded Cano and put runners at the corners. Slumping Chris Carter lined an RBI single off Charlie Furbush to score Grossman.	Furbush (0-1) was pulled for Danny Farquhar but the rally continued. Jed Lowrie walked on a full count and Jake Marisnick followed with a single on the first pitch to score Gonzalez and tie the game at 3-3. Altuve then delivered the big blow that cleared the bases.	"We needed only one run in that situation and fortunately I got the hit but I think the guys in front of me did it all," Altuve said.	Taijuan Walker was in line for his first victory of the season -- and the first by a Seattle starter other than Felix Hernandez -- before the failures of the bullpen. Walker matched his career high with eight strikeouts and pitched into the sixth, allowing just one earned run. Walker lowered his ERA by nearly 7 points after allowed 14 earned runs in his first two starts.	"We just imploded in the eighth," Seattle manager Lloyd McClendon said. "I thought we were in a real good position to win a ballgame and just couldn't close it out."	MISSED COUNT	Walker should have had one less strikeout and one more walk. George Springer struck out on a 3-2 pitch in the fifth, part of a perfect inning by Walker. But in a case of a mistaken count, the strikeout came after Walker had already thrown four balls.	"I think everybody in the ballpark pretty much missed it, which ultimately falls on me," Houston manager A.J. Hinch said. "I've got to be up out of the dugout again and make sure. There was a lot of confusion on that and fortunately for us it didn't burn us."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: Reliever Josh Fields (groin) appears ready to return from his rehab assignment at Triple-A Fresno. Fields made his fifth appearance with Fresno on Monday, but the Astros are not ready to announce plans for his return.	Mariners: Reliever Tom Wilhelmsen (hyperextended elbow) is expected to start a throwing program later this week. Manager Lloyd McClendon said Wilhelmsen will likely need a few rehab innings before rejoining Seattle's bullpen.	UP NEXT	Astros: Roberto Hernandez (0-1) looks for his first win with Houston. Hernandez hasn't pitched at Safeco Field since August 2012.	Mariners: J.A. Happ (0-1) looks to build on two strong outings thus far. Happ has allowed only two earned runs in each of his first two starts but is yet to get a victory.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

Lincecum shut down the first-place Dodgers with some sparkling double-play defense behind him, and the San Francisco Giants came out of their first day off seemingly refreshed to beat Los Angeles 6-2 on Tuesday.	"It's just about pitchability and making good pitches when you have to and putting the bad ones behind you when you can and moving on," Lincecum said. "I've felt like that's kind of been what plagued me in the past, I let them kind of drag me down. I'm not saying this is a whole different evolution of a pitcher, I'm just trying to make my way with what I've got."	Justin Maxwell hit a two-run homer in the eighth inning and San Francisco won for just the second time in 11 games behind Lincecum's first victory in three starts, snapping the defending division champion Dodgers' seven-game winning streak.	Nori Aoki, Brandon Crawford and Buster Posey hit RBI singles for the Giants, who turned four double plays for Lincecum (1-1) including in the first two innings.	The two-time NL Cy Young Award winner struck out five in six innings, allowing five hits and one run with three walks.	"We were getting guys on early but we erased them with the 2-ball," Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said.	A marquee matchup is on tap for Wednesday night between reigning NL MVP and Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw and World Series MVP Madison Bumgarner in a likely duel of top left-handers. It marks the fourth time they have met and first since Sept. 13, 2013. It's the first time the reigning regular-season MVP goes opposite the World Series MVP in a starting pitching matchup, according to STATS.	Maxwell, getting a rare start, tripled in the second off Brett Anderson (1-1) and scored on Brandon Crawford's bunt single. He earned another start Wednesday, manager Bruce Bochy said.	"It's important for us to get on track and play better ball," Bochy said. "The old adage, you can't win it here but you can lose it here if you get too far back."	Maxwell made a remarkable catch in foul territory while crashing into the wall in right field on Yasiel Puig's hard-hit ball in the eighth. Maxwell's left knee and side made hard contact with the cement portion of the wall and athletic trainer Dave Groeschner and center fielder Angel Pagan came over to check on him. Puig clapped for Maxwell from the dugout as the outfielder shook off his tender wrist and stayed in the game.	He added to his big day with the homer to deep left in the bottom half, his first with the Giants.	"It's nice to see him find a home with us and doing well," Lincecum said.	Puig went 2 for 4 while returning to the Los Angeles lineup from his own injury after missing four of the previous five games with a sore left hamstring.	Lincecum, who cut his hair since his last start in a rocker-inspired `do, bounced back from a 4-2 defeat to Colorado last Wednesday. After Jean Machi walked the bases loaded in the ninth, Santiago Casilla came in and threw a wild pitch that scored a run before finishing for his fifth save in as many tries.	Anderson was done after four innings and dropped to 0-3 in four career starts against San Francisco.	Rookie Dodgers center fielder Joc Pederson singled and walked twice as he spent his 23rd birthday playing in front of family and friends in his native Bay Area.	---	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: Closer Kenley Jansen will continue throwing bullpens every other day until he's ready to face live hitters in his recovery from left foot surgery. "He's on track for us," Mattingly said.	Giants: RF Hunter Pence's rehab from a fractured left forearm will take longer than the initial May 1 target date. He still must hit off a tee and soft toss, "all these boxes he's got to check off," Bochy said.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: Last year, Kershaw (1-1) went 3-0 with a 1.69 ERA in four starts against San Francisco.	Giants: Bumgarner (1-1) is 11-5 with a 2.54 ERA in his first 17 outings, 16 starts, against the Dodgers and went 3-2 in five appearances last year while allowing two or fewer runs in four of those.	DODGERS ADDITION	Outfielder Chris Heisey, acquired in a December trade from the Reds, joined the Dodgers from Triple-A but had yet to be activated. Mattingly remained mum on Heisey's potential role.	"We wouldn't fly him here for no reason," Mattingly said.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

CHICAGO --  Jeff Samardzija wound up in the win column for the first time with the Chicago White Sox, helped by a couple of big swings Jose Abreu took against Corey Kluber.	Samardzija threw six shutout innings as the White Sox trounced the reigning AL Cy Young Award winner and the Cleveland Indians 6-0 on Wednesday.	Samardzija (1-1) had been winless in his first three starts for the White Sox. The 30-year-old righty from nearby Merrillville, Indiana, allowed six hits, walked two and struck out three.	"You get new teammates and you want to make sure you prove your worth to them," said Samardzija, acquired in a trade with Oakland in December.	"They gave me an early run, early two runs. That's a big cushion to have and that allowed me to go out and pound the zone with what I thought was subpar stuff," he said.	Abreu homered for the second straight day. He hit a solo shot in the first inning and added a two-run double in the seventh to chase Kluber (0-2).	Kluber gave up a career-high 13 hits and six earned runs in his fourth start of the year. He struck out six, walked one and threw two wild pitches, and was pulled before he got an out in the seventh.	"I made some mistakes and I probably didn't do a good enough job pitching inside to keep them off balance when I did make those mistakes," Kluber said.	Samardzija gave up two singles and a walk to load the bases in the third, but got out of the jam when Brandon Moss filed to right to end the inning.	Samardzija left with the two-run lead after throwing 113 pitches.	"He labored a little bit," White Sox manager Robin Ventura said. "When he needed to make a pitch, he made a pitch. He has some tools to him. . It's nice to him to gut through and get to a point where we could get to the bullpen."	Adam Eaton doubled to open the third, reached third on Melky Cabrera's single and scored on Abreu's double-play grounder to make it 2-0.	Kluber gave up another run in the sixth when his wild pitch let Avisail Garcia score.	Chicago made it 4-0 in the seventh as Cabrera singled home Micah Johnson. Abreu's double to deep left scored Eaton and Cabrera.	"It's a hard way to pitch when we're throwing up zeroes as an offense," Indians manager Terry Francona said. "I think he probably feels like he has to be perfect and that's a hard way to pitch."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: RHP Carlos Carrasco, pulled after five innings Tuesday night because of general tightness in the cold weather, said he felt fine on Wednesday. "It was maybe the first three or four (pitches) every inning. He was just tight. It was kind of ambiguous," Francona said. "Maybe I overreacted. If that's the case, that's one thing I won't apologize for." ... IF/OF Zach Walters began his rehab assignment Wednesday at Triple-A Columbus. He played third base, going 1 for 4 with an RBI and a run scored.	White Sox: RHP Jake Petricka made his first appearance since being activated from the 15-day disabled list (right forearm strain) on Monday. He worked a scoreless ninth, allowing one hit and one walk.	UP NEXT	Indians: Off Thursday, then send RHP Danny Salazar (1-0, 3.00 ERA) to open a three-game weekend series on Friday at Detroit. He'll have five days' rest since his 4-2 win in his April 18 season debut at Minnesota.	White Sox: LHP Chris Sale (2-0, 2.25 ERA) makes his third start of the season and second in Thursday's opening of a four-game series against the Royals. Sale is 7-8 with a 2.68 ERA in 13 starts against Kansas City.	WOEFUL WEATHER	Snowflakes were spotted at U.S. Cellular Field and temperatures hovered at 39 degrees with wind chills in the 20s prior to the start of Wednesday afternoon's series finale.	POWER PACKED	Abreu has five homers for the season and leads the majors with 14 home runs and 31 RBIs in the first inning since the start of last year.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

WASHINGTON --  Kolten Wong keeps causing trouble for the Washington Nationals.	Wong homered and drove in the tiebreaking run with a double in the eighth inning to lift the St. Louis Cardinals to a 7-5 victory over the Washington Nationals on Wednesday night.	Wong finished 3 for 4 for the second straight night. He hit a two-run homer in the second inning and the tie-breaking double gave him three RBIs.	He also made two spectacular plays at second base and a third good one, helping St. Louis on offense and defense.	"You always want to try and have that one game where you can play both sides really well, and (this) was my night," Wong said. "I got to play well on both sides, and I got to help to contribute to the win."	Wong ranged into short center field to grab grounders and throw out Yunel Escobar to end the fifth and Wilson Ramos starting the sixth. He also made a nice play later that inning on Danny Espinosa's grounder, going far to his left and throwing to pitcher John Lackey covering first.	"(He) had a huge day," St. Louis manager Mike Matheny said. "There's a couple of plays there you just don't think that there's any chance. Just overall a very good day for Kolten."	The tiebreaking hit might have been Wong's biggest moment. Jon Jay drew a one-out walk off Blake Treinen (0-2) in the eighth and moved to third on Yadier Molina's single. Wong then sliced a double down the left-field line, scoring Jay to break a 5-5 tie.	Matt Adams added a solo homer in the ninth off Rafael Martin to close the scoring.	Kevin Siegrist (1-0) pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings and Trevor Rosenthal got the last three outs for his fifth save as St. Louis won for the sixth time in seven games.	The Cardinals appeared headed for an easy night after taking a 5-0 lead in the third inning.	Matt Carpenter led off the game with a homer off Washington starter Doug Fister, and Wong added his two-run shot in the second. The Cardinals added two more in the third for the five-run lead.	The Nationals then bounced back with five runs in the third, tying the game on Yunel Escobar's three-run double with two outs off Lackey.	"I'm proud of the guys for fighting," Nationals manager Matt Williams said. "It's one of those days where you could just easily fold the tent and say it's not our day, but they came back and made a game of it."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: OF Randal Grichuk is making progress toward a return. Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said Wednesday that Grichuk is moving around well but have yet to talk about a rehab assignment. Grichuk went on the disabled list with a lower back strain last Friday.	Nationals: 3B Anthony Rendon (sprained left knee) played five innings in extended spring training on Wednesday and is coming back to Washington for a workout with the Nationals on Thursday. He'll then head to Double-A Harrisburg to begin a rehab assignment on Friday. Manager Matt Williams said he wasn't sure of a timeline for Rendon returning to the Nationals but they wanted to get him up to playing nine innings and a bunch of at-bats.	WELCOME TO THE BIG LEAGUES	Nationals left-hander Matt Grace made his major league debut in this game. Called up earlier in the day when LHP Felipe Rivero (intestinal bleed) went on the 15-day disabled list, Grace threw a scoreless seventh inning, walking one without giving up a hit while the teams were locked in a 5-5 tie.	DOUBLE TROUBLE	Lackey made two errors on one play in the bottom of the fourth inning. Denard Span hit a grounder back to the box that Lackey fielded, then dropped and then threw wildly past first. However, the Nationals stranded Span at second.	UP NEXT	Cardinals RHP Michael Wacha (2-0, 1.35) has beaten the Reds in his first two starts, giving up a total of two runs while winning both times.	Nationals: RHP Max Scherzer (1-1, 0.83), a St. Louis native, is coming off a stellar eight-inning effort in a victory over the Phillies last Friday. He has already struck out 25 in 21 2/3 innings this season.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PHILADELPHIA --  The Miami Marlins wanted to snap their early season skid.	And the Philadelphia Phillies gave them plenty of help.	Adeiny Hechavarria had a pair of hits and scored the go-ahead run and Miami took advantage of Philadelphia's sloppy play to end a five-game losing streak with a 6-1 victory over the Phillies on Wednesday.	The Marlins scored five unearned runs.	"We haven't gotten a lot of breaks," manager Mike Redmond said. "We got a few tonight and took advantage."	They took the lead in the seventh. Hechavarria scored from third when Luis Garcia (1-1) balked while trying to hold the speedy Dee Gordon on first. It was the first run Garcia has given up in eight innings of relief this season.	And the Phillies' defense struggled in the eighth when the Marlins scored four unearned runs with help from two Philadelphia fielding miscues.	"We didn't do too much right tonight," Phillies manager Ryne Sandberg said.	Cody Asche homered for the Phillies.	With two outs in the eighth, Ichiro Suzuki and Hechavarria both singled. Then Chase Utley dropped a routine throw to second on what could have been the third out, loading the bases for Gordon.	"It looked like he took his eye off it or anticipated he already caught it," Sandberg said. "Everything snowballed in the eighth inning."	Center fielder Odubel Herrera then took an awkward path to Gordon's drive to deep center, running with his back to home plate before spinning around close to the warning track and dropping the ball. All three runs scored, giving Miami a 5-1 lead.	Martin Prado followed with Miami's only RBI, lining a double down the left-field line to score Gordon and put the Marlins 6-1.	Philadelphia left-hander Cole Hamels remained winless through four starts after allowing an unearned run and five hits in six innings. Hamels lowered his season ERA to 3.75, but received low run support. He struck out five and walked three.	The Marlins got their lone run off Hamels in the second when Marcell Ozuna scored from third when Hamels mishandled Utley's throw to first on Jarred Cosart's grounder that could've been the third out of the inning.	Philadelphia tied it in the bottom half.	Asche, who entered with a team-best .341 average, continued his strong start by leading off the inning with a homer to deep right.	But the Phillies managed just three other hits off Cosart (1-1), who was impressive in his debut against the team that drafted him.	"Right now, we'll take anything," Cosart said. "We're trying to scratch out wins any way we can. It worked out for us today."	BACK IN PHILLY	A 38th-round pick of Philadelphia in 2008, Cosart gave up one run and four hits with four strikeouts in six innings. He was traded by the Phillies to the Astros in 2011 as part of the trade that brought Hunter Pence to Philadelphia.	"It was my first game pitching here," Cosart said. "The team that drafted you is pretty special. They gave me my first opportunity. I have no disrespect for any of them, but it's fun. I'm happy to be on a division rival right now. We're trying to beat everybody. It might be a little bit more special to get a win against the team that drafted you."	SLUMP BUSTED	Utley snapped an 0-for-21 skid with a first-inning single. He went hitless in his final three at-bats and his average stands at .120.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: LF Christian Yelich (back) missed his second straight game.	Phillies: RHP Sean O'Sullivan (knee) was placed on the 15-day DL.	UP NEXT	Marlins: RHP David Phelps (0-0, 7.94) looks for his first win in his second start and fourth appearance of the season when Miami closes its 10-game road trip at 1:05 on Thursday against the Phillies.	Phillies: Right-handed reliever Dustin McGowan will start a bullpen-by-committee game for the Phillies. McGowan, who is replacing O'Sullivan in the rotation, is 1-0 with a 2.57 ERA in five relief appearances this season. He expects to be able to pitch three or four innings in Thursday's start.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PITTSBURGH --  Tony Watson had a save that was reminiscent of bygone days.	The Pirates' left-hander inherited a bases-loaded jam in the eighth inning and got the final six outs Wednesday night for his first save of the season and fifth of his five-year career as Pittsburgh held off the Chicago Cubs 4-3.	Gregory Polanco hit his first home run of the season and Vance Worley (2-1) got through 5 2/3 shaky innings for his second straight win.	Multi-inning saves are rare with today's specialized bullpens. However, the Pirates needed Watson to pitch two innings because closer Mark Melancon was not available after throwing 25 pitches in a loss the previous night.	"It's just part of the gig," Watson said. "Everyone knew we had to step it up a little bit more tonight. That's what a bullpen does, though. The guys pick each other up."	"It wasn't the plan to use Tony that long but it was a gritty performance on his part," Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said.	Polanco's leadoff home run in the bottom of the fifth inning off Jason Hammel increased the Pirates' lead to 4-1. It came after Polanco made a fine running catch of a fly ball hit by rookie star Kris Bryant with the bases loaded to end the top of the inning.	Polanco also doubled as he finished with two hits.	The Pirates needed the three-run cushion as the Cubs loaded the bases with none out in the eighth against Jared Hughes, who gave up a run on three hits and a walk.	Watson relieved and allowed an inherited runner to score on a fielder's choice grounder by Chris Coghlan before holding the 4-3 lead by getting Jonathan Herrera to foul out and rookie Addison Russell to line out.	"They got us," Chicago manager Joe Maddon said. "We just couldn't get a hit when we needed to. If we keep playing with that kind of intensity and effort on a nightly basis we're going to win a lot of games this year."	Worley allowed an unearned run on six hits and five walks. He also struck five in a 106-pitch outing.	"It wasn't always easy and my pitches weren't always going where I wanted but I kept the runs off the board," Worley said	Hammel (1-1) gave up four runs -- three earned -- and six hits in five innings with five walks and no strikeouts.	Anthony Rizzo had two of the Cubs' 10 hits. Russell, who debuted Tuesday, had his first major league hit with a single off Worley in the second inning.	Francisco Cervelli hit an RBI double and Jung Ho Kang followed with a sacrifice fly in the second inning to open the scoring for the Pirates and Pedro Alvarez made it 3-0 with a sacrifice fly in the third.	Bryant doubled in the fourth inning and scored the Cubs' first run on Starlin Castro's grounder.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: LHP Tsuyoshi Wada (left groin strain) made his first rehab start for Triple-A Iowa on Wednesday, allowing two runs and six hits in 5 1/3 innings with four walks and five strikeouts against New Orleans. ... RHP Justin Grimm (right forearm inflammation) threw his second bullpen session at the extended spring training camp in Mesa, Ariz.	Pirates: SS Jordy Mercer (bruised chest) missed his third straight game and is considered day-to-day. ... RHP Charlie Morton (right hip surgery) will make his second extended spring training start Thursday at Bradenton, Fla.	OUTFIELDERS EXIT	Cubs CF Dexter Fowler left the game after the second inning because of tightness in his groin. . In the fifth inning, Pirates LF Starling Marte exited with a soft tissue contusion in his right hand. He was hit by a pitch in the third inning from Hammel.	UP NEXT	Cubs: RHP Kyle Hendricks (0-0 6.10) faces Pittsburgh for the first time.	Pirates: LHP Jeff Locke (2-0, 1.93) is 1-1 with a 3.81 ERA against the Cubs in five career starts.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

Travis got three hits, including a go-ahead home run that sent the Toronto Blue Jays over the Baltimore Orioles 4-2 on Wednesday night.	"He's a special kid," manager John Gibbons said of the rookie infielder. "He's got a great idea of the strike zone."	Travis came in leading all big league rookies in average and RBIs. He returned to the lineup after leaving Sunday's game against Atlanta when he was hit by a pitch in the ribs.	With four home runs, he's tied with Toronto sluggers Jose Bautista and Edwin Encarnacion for the team lead. To Travis, that's "crazy."	"I don't know what's happening," Travis said of his early power surge. "That's just a blessing because I don't know where the heck that's coming from."	Justin Smoak also connected for the Blue Jays, whose 21 homers are tied with the Yankees for the most in the majors.	Aaron Sanchez (1-2) overcame seven walks in 5 1/3 innings as the Blue Jays posted back-to-back home wins for the first time this season.	"We didn't take advantage of the walks," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.	Brett Cecil got two outs in the eighth and Miguel Castro recorded four outs for his third save.	Pinch hitter Delmon Young grounded into a game-ending double play with two runners on. Toronto turned four double plays.	Travis hit a two-run homer in the fifth off Ubaldo Jimenez (1-1) that broke a 2-all tie.	Jose Reyes singled to begin the fifth and Travis followed with a drive into the batter's eye in dead center.	"I was supposed to throw the splitter down and I left it right in the middle," Jimenez said.	Jimmy Paredes put the Orioles ahead with a two-run homer.	Smoak hit a two-run shot in the fourth, the first runs Jimenez had allowed this season. Jimenez allowed four runs and six hits in five innings. All three of his walks came in the fourth.	"I was trying to be too fine," Jimenez said. "I was trying to nibble too much around the corners and throwing too many breaking balls and that made me fall behind."	Sanchez left with runners at first and second after a one-out walk to Travis Snider in the sixth. Manny Machado singled off rookie Roberto Osuna to load the bases, but the Blue Jays escaped when Ryan Flaherty popped out and Caleb Joseph struck out.	Alejando De Aza singled with one out in the Baltimore seventh and went to second on an error by left fielder Ryan Goins. After Paredes flied out, De Aza was thrown out trying to steal third.	Showalter wasn't happy that De Aza didn't give slugger Chris Davis a chance to bat with a runner in scoring position.	"You'd like to give Chris a chance to swing the bat there," Showalter said.	COOLER HEADS PREVAIL	One night after Bautista got in a shouting match with Orioles OF Adam Jones after admiring a long home run, there was no sign of ill feeling on either side. "It wasn't even a topic of conversation, especially once they played the anthem," Showalter said. Sanchez threw a pitch over the head of Joseph in the third, but it was viewed as unintentional.	STREAKS SNAPPED	Jones' six-game hitting streak against Toronto ended with an 0 for 3 night. Joseph's career-high seven-game hitting streak ended with his 0 for 3.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: Minor league prospect Hunter Harvey (broken leg) made 15 pitches from a half mound and played long toss. He is on the minor league disabled list.	Blue Jays: Bautista sat out because of a strained right shoulder. He was hurt trying to throw out a Baltimore batter from right field during Tuesday's testy game. Bautista won't play the outfield for the next few days and could end up on the disabled list if his shoulder doesn't improve soon.	UP NEXT	Orioles RH Chris Tillman (2-1) faces Blue Jays RH Drew Hutchison (1-0) in Thursday's series finale. Hutchison has failed to finish the fifth inning in his past two starts, including an April 12 game at Baltimore in which he allowed seven runs and two home runs. Tillman, who took the loss for the Orioles that day, also allowed seven runs and two homers as Toronto won 10-7.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DETROIT -- Jacoby Ellsbury turned as if to start his swing and then crumpled to the ground after David Price's pitch caught him square in the chest.	With temperatures in the 30s in downtown Detroit, this was no way to begin the game.	"It felt like a frozen snowball or something, going at 93," Ellsbury said.	Ellsbury shook off the pain and went to first base, and Price's problems were only beginning. The New York Yankees scored six runs off him in the first inning amid swirling snow flurries, and they went on to a 13-4 rout of the Detroit Tigers on Wednesday night.	Price (1-1) allowed eight runs and 10 hits in 2 1/3 innings, his second straight terrible start against the Yankees. Detroit has lost back-to-back games for the first time this season.	Price said he stayed in the dugout after being pulled, instead of retreating to the warmth of the Detroit clubhouse.	"You throw the ball as bad as I did and you give up more runs than you get outs, you don't deserve to come up here," Price said. "That's why I stayed out there."	Adam Warren (1-1) allowed four runs in the bottom of the first, walking four of the first five batters he faced, but he was fine after that. He ended up allowing five hits in 5 2/3 innings, and New York kept padding its lead.	Mark Teixeira homered for the Yankees (8-7), who moved above .500 for the first time this year.	Gregorio Petit hit a three-run double during that first inning, when Price threw 51 pitches on a 38-degree night at Comerica Park.	"I'm sure I was warmer than the players," New York manager Joe Girardi said. "I can wear as much as I want. I don't have to really worry about moving too much. It was a chilly night. You're watching snow in the first inning. ... Our guys handled it well."	Price allowed eight runs in the third inning of a game against the Yankees last August. They jumped on him from the start Wednesday. The Detroit left-hander hit Ellsbury to start the game, and Brian McCann later opened the scoring with a bases-loaded single.	Price struck out Carlos Beltran for the second out, but Chase Headley followed with an RBI single, and Petit's bases-clearing double made it 5-0.	Ellsbury added a run-scoring single before Price finally got Chris Young -- the 11th batter of the inning -- on a flyout.	While all that was going on, snow flurries in downtown Detroit intensified a bit, making for an unusual spectacle of white flakes drifting around above the field.	"It was tough," Warren said. "I think you just kind of have to learn how to pitch out there and find a way to get some feeling in your hands and on the ball."	The snow went away after a while, and the Tigers went through their whole batting order in the bottom of the first. Warren issued a bases-loaded walk to J.D. Martinez, and after Yoenis Cespedes hit an RBI single, Nick Castellanos brought another run in by grounding into a force play.	Alex Avila's run-scoring single made it 6-4, but Jose Iglesias popped out to end the inning. It was the first time both teams sent at least nine men to the plate in the same inning since Sept. 28, 2014, according to STATS. The Yankees and Boston Red Sox did it in the seventh that day.	POURING IT ON	Beltran and Headley hit back-to-back RBI triples in the second, and Didi Gregorius hit a two-run double in the fourth. Teixeira's fifth homer of the season was a three-run shot off Al Alburquerque in the seventh.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: LHP Chris Capuano (right quadriceps) struck out one in two hitless innings against Toronto minor leaguers in his first extended spring training game. "No problems," Capuano said. "A little rusty with the pitches." Capuano, expected back in mid-May, threw 18 of 24 pitches for strikes. ... RHP Jared Burton (strained lat) allowed one hit during a scoreless inning in his second extended spring game.	Tigers: RHP Joe Nathan (strained right elbow) left his rehab outing with Triple-A Toledo after pitching less than an inning. "He felt a pop on a fastball," Detroit manager Brad Ausmus said. "The first two hitters went well, then he felt it, thought maybe it was scar tissue, tried to throw another (practice) pitch but it didn't go so well." Ausmus said after the game the team would hold off on making any announcement about Nathan.	UP NEXT	New York RHP Masahiro Tanaka (2-1) takes the mound in the series finale Thursday against Detroit RHP Anibal Sanchez (1-2).	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

NEW YORK -- Consistent pitching, nifty defense and well-placed hits at just the right time. Lucas Duda and the New York Mets are playing so well they're practically giddy.	Duda hit a go-ahead single in the eighth inning that sent the Mets to their 10th consecutive victory Wednesday night, 3-2 over the Atlanta Braves.	"It's unbelievable, coming to the ballpark every day. Just a great feeling when you walk in the doors. It's just fun. There's no other word to describe it," a smiling Duda said. "It's pretty special. It's hard to do."	Wilmer Flores hit a tying homer and an RBI single for the Mets (12-3), on their longest winning streak since taking 10 straight in July 2008. Another victory in the series finale Thursday afternoon would match the team record of 11 in a row -- last accomplished in 1990 -- and complete a perfect 10-game run on their first homestand of the season.	Despite injuries to several key players, New York is off to its best start since the 1986 World Series champions opened 13-3.	"These guys have just taken off. I salute every single one of them," manager Terry Collins said. "Pitching has been remarkable."	Helped out by some slick defense, Mets starter Dillon Gee allowed only two runs in seven steady innings after the first pitch was delayed 31 minutes by rain.	Second baseman Ruben Tejada robbed Nick Markakis of a hit by leaping high for a snow-cone grab, and Gold Glove winner Juan Lagares ran down Jace Peterson's drive in deep center, reaching behind his head for a sensational catch.	"That was unbelievable," Gee said. "That ranks up there with the best catches I've seen on the field."	A frustrated Gee was the subject of trade speculation all winter and was ticketed for the bullpen until Zack Wheeler's season-ending elbow injury this spring. With his spot in the rotation perhaps in jeopardy, Gee had a chat with Collins between starts and delivered a quality outing.	"I think I just needed to talk, and he was there for me and we talked about a lot of things. I think I was going about a lot of things the wrong way," Gee said. "It comes down to me executing and resolving to stay out there."	Flores tied it 2-all with a solo homer off reliever Cody Martin in the seventh.	Pinch hitter Curtis Granderson drew a leadoff walk from Jim Johnson (1-1) in the eighth and went to third when Lagares chopped a hit-and-run single barely through the right side of the infield.	Duda singled to left for his latest clutch hit early this season.	"I feel like I executed a lot of pitches," Johnson said. "It seems like a little luck went their way and it seems like it's been going their way."	Buddy Carlyle (1-0) retired dangerous pinch hitter Jonny Gomes with two on, and Jeurys Familia got three quick outs for his seventh save.	Eric Stults gave the Braves a solid start, yielding one run and four hits in six innings. He struck out five and walked none.	A.J. Pierzynski went 3-for-3 with a walk for Atlanta, and Andrelton Simmons had an RBI single. Ex-Met Eric Young Jr. tripled and scored on Alberto Callaspo's sacrifice fly.	"We played well tonight. But it's just one of those things where a team gets momentum and they kind of feed off of it," Stults said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Braves: Minor league lefty Brady Feigl had Tommy John surgery Tuesday. Feigl was with Atlanta in spring training and appeared in one game for Triple-A Gwinnett this season.	Mets: RHP Matt Harvey has a mild left ankle sprain but will make his next scheduled start Saturday at Yankee Stadium, the team said. Harvey said he hurt the ankle in spring training when he ran into the wall while shagging flies. ... Backup catcher Anthony Recker has a bone spur in the back of his right elbow but is able to play, the Mets said. The spur might be removed after the season. In a move that was likely related, New York acquired minor league catcher Dan Rohlfing from Minnesota for cash. Rohlfing will report to Triple-A Las Vegas.	MR. CONSISTENT	Gee has lasted at least five innings in 49 straight starts, the longest active streak in the majors and one shy of Dwight Gooden's club record.	NEW AT THE TOP	Batting leadoff for the first time in his career, Mets RF John Mayberry Jr. tripled his first time up but was stranded. Mayberry fanned his next two times, leaving him 6-for-14 (.429) with five extra-base hits against Stults.	UP NEXT	Braves: RHP Julio Teheran (2-0, 3.71 ERA) starts Thursday. Teheran beat the Mets 5-3 at Turner Field on April 11, allowing two hits in six innings. He is 4-2 with a 3.04 ERA against them.	Mets: RHP Bartolo Colon (3-0, 2.25 ERA) went seven innings for a 4-3 win April 12 in Atlanta. He is 5-2 with a 2.25 ERA in seven starts versus the Braves. Simmons and Freddie Freeman are both 6-for-13 (.462) against him.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  The Tampa Bay Rays appeared headed toward a fifth straight loss at home until things changed in the late innings.	Jake Elmore homered, Brandon Guyer had a two-run, pinch-hit single in a four-run sixth and the Rays rallied from a four-run deficit to beat the Boston Red Sox 7-5 on Wednesday night.	"We needed that one," Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash said. "For the guys to come back from that deficit against that team, it just keeps impressing all of us, showing what they're about."	After a tiebreaking run scored on Desmond Jennings' double-play grounder, Elmore gave the Rays a 7-5 advantage with his solo shot off Edward Mujica (1-1) on his first at-bat with Tampa Bay after having his contract purchased from Triple-A Durham before the game.	"That was about as good as you could draw it up," Elmore said.	Tampa Bay had tied it at 5 in the sixth. Allan Dykstra drove in a run with the fourth consecutive single to start the inning before Logan Forsythe drew a four-pitch, bases-loaded walk that ended Joe Kelly's game. Guyer hit his two-run single off Craig Breslow.	"I didn't get ahead of hitters," Kelly said, "In the sixth inning, I tried to get too fine and fell behind hitters, and had to throw it down the middle from there."	Brad Boxberger (1-1) struck out all three batters he faced in the seventh to help Tampa Bay stop a four-game skid to begin a nine-game homestand. Steve Geltz pitched the ninth for his first career save.	Dustin Pedroia and David Ortiz homered for Boston.	Pedroia hit a two-run shot off Nathan Karns during a three-run third as the Red Sox took a 3-1 lead. Hanley Ramirez scored the other run from first base on Mike Napoli's single that went off Karns' glove and ended up in center field.	Ortiz made it 4-1 on a fifth-inning solo homer. The designated hitter moved past Joe DiMaggio into 46th place on the career RBI list with 1,538, and also broke a tie with Chipper Jones for 32nd place on the homer list with his 469th shot.	Mookie Betts had a run-scoring single in the sixth for Boston.	Steven Souza Jr. put the Rays up 1-0 with a first-inning homer. He departed after striking out to the end the sixth due to a right forearm cramp but is hopeful of playing Thursday.	"Nothing crazy happened," he said. "Just precautionary."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: RF Shane Victorino left after four innings with right hamstring tightness. He is not expected to start Thursday but the injury is not considered serious.	Rays: LHP Drew Smyly (left shoulder) will rejoin the rotation Friday. ... RHP Alex Cobb (forearm) could have his first bullpen session Friday. ... 1B James Loney (oblique) is nearing a short minor league rehab assignment.	MORE BIG PAPI	Ortiz has the second-most homers against Tampa Bay with 45. Only Alex Rodriguez, with 49, has more. Ortiz has the most RBIs, 153, against the Rays. ... He has 30 homers and 76 RBIs at Tropicana Field, the most for any visiting player.	STARTING TIME	Red Sox: Kelly gave up five runs and eight hits in 5-plus innings. He struck out seven and walked one.	Rays: Karns allowed five runs, seven hits, four walks and had three strikeouts over six innings.	UP NEXT	Red Sox: Thursday night starter Clay Buchholz (1-2, 6.06 ERA) has not allowed an earned run over 14 innings in winning both of his starts at Tampa Bay since 2013.	Rays: RHP Jake Odorizzi (2-1, 1.74 ERA) plans to attack the strike zone in Thursday night's start against Boston, which entered Wednesday leading the AL with 63 walks. "They work at-bats," Odorizzi said. The Red Sox walked four times Wednesday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  It had been a while since Mike Pelfrey saw a `W' next to his game in the box score.	Pelfrey pitched seven scoreless innings to pick up his first victory since 2013 as the Minnesota Twins beat the Kansas City Royals 3-0 Wednesday night.	"We needed a lift, and Mike gave us one," Twins manager Paul Molitor said. "He seemed to get strong as the game went on. We let him ride through the seventh. His splitter was good tonight. He used the curve and the slider. It was a pick-me-up game for us, and Mike gave us a lift.	Pelfrey's last victory was Sept. 23, 2013, against Detroit. He went 0-3 in five starts last year before undergoing season-ending elbow surgery on June 10.	"You feel good for a guy who has to go through all that rehab to get an opportunity," Molitor said. "He fought hard and was aggressive, and was rewarded justly."	Pelfrey (1-0) gave up five singles, walked two, hit two batters and struck out four. It was his longest outing since he went seven innings against Texas on Aug. 31, 2013.	"I pitched in a little bit and got them off the plate," Pelfrey said.	Glen Perkins got the last three outs for his third save.	Joe Mauer reached base four times with two hits and two walks and scored a run.	Royals starter Jeremy Guthrie (0-1) gave up all three runs and six hits with a career high-tying six walks in five innings.	The Twins scored all their runs in the first on three hits, two walks and a hit batter. Oswaldo Arcia was hit by Guthrie with the bases loaded to bring home Brian Dozier. Kennys Vargas and Dozier singled in the other two runs. Guthrie induced Kurt Suzuki to ground into a double play with the bases loaded to end the inning and prevent further damage.	The Twins loaded the bases in the second on Torii Hunter's double and walks to Joe Mauer and Dozier. However, Hunter was out trying to steal home to end the inning.	"The crowd told me," Guthrie said of knowing that Hunter was running. "I never really saw him. I was in my mechanics when I go into the motion. The roar of the crowd told me something was happening. I popped my head up and saw Sal (Perez, catcher) was standing up, so I attempted to get it to him as quick as possible."	Guthrie did not allow a run after the first, but he was never sharp, throwing only 50 percent strikes in 98 pitches.	"It's real uncharacteristic of Jeremy," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "The veteran pitcher in him allowed him to keep us in the game through five and get us in a spot where we can manage it."	Yohan Pino replaced Guthrie and threw three scoreless innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Twins: LHP Brian Duensing (right intercostal strain) started soft tossing Wednesday.	Royals: 2B Omar Infante (strained left groin) missed his third straight game. Manager Ned Yost said Infante could have played, but did not want to push him.	NO EXCUSE FOR WALKS	Guthrie said this was his third time to walk six in a game. "One time it was my first every start and the other time I had a hurt on," Guthrie said. "I didn't have either of those tonight. I was just a random to see if I can walk six, hit one and get through it."	JOE COOL	Mauer's two hits raised his batting average at Kauffman Stadium to .331 (91 for 275). He has hit safely in 12 of 15 games season. He leads the club with eight walks.	UP NEXT	Twins: RHP Phil Hughes (0-3, 5.30 ERA) starts against the Mariners on Friday.	Royals: RHP Yordano Ventura (2-1, 4.80 ERA), fined Tuesday for hitting Oakland's Brett Lawrie Sunday, starts Thursday against the Chicago White Sox.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

MILWAUKEE --  Scoring the winning run on a wild pitch was the easy part. Avoiding a collision with the home plate umpire was a bit tougher for Billy Hamilton.	Hamilton dashed home on a two-out wild pitch in the ninth inning and the Cincinnati Reds beat Milwaukee 2-1 Wednesday night, the Brewers' eighth straight loss.	"I tried my best not to run over somebody, or hurt him or hurt myself," Hamilton said.	Hamilton scored both runs for Cincinnati, which won its third straight game against Milwaukee after enduring a 1-6 stretch. The Brewers have the worst record in the majors at 2-13.	Hamilton, who earlier stole his majors-leading ninth base, drew a one-out walk in the ninth from Francisco Rodriguez (0-2). Hamilton took third on a single by Joey Votto and scored standing up on a pitch that bounced in the dirt and off the chest protector of catcher Martin Maldonado.	The ball skipped to Maldonado's right and he quickly retrieved it. Maldonado threw to Rodriguez, who tried to make a diving tag, but Hamilton zipped past him before nearly running over plate umpire Sean Barber.	"I apologized for not sliding. I really didn't see Rodriguez in the picture at all until I got to home plate," he said. "I told (Barber) it was my bad, I should be sliding there. But he understands. I've got to score, no matter what."	Johnny Cueto (1-2) threw a career-high 125 pitches in eight innings. He gave up five hits and struck out eight, winning his fifth decision in a row against Milwaukee.	Cueto became the first Cincinnati pitcher to balk twice in a game since Chris Hammond did it on Aug. 18, 1990, vs. Pittsburgh.	Aroldis Chapman pitched the ninth for his fourth save.	In the Brewers eighth, pinch hitter Logan Schafer led off with a double and took third on a sacrifice bunt by Elian Herrera. But Cueto struck out Elian Herrera, walked Ryan Braun and struck out Adam Lind to end the threat.	"That bottom of the eighth was something," Cincinnati manager Bryan Price said. "I didn't like seeing 125 pitches, but the bottom line at the point and time I thought it was his game."	Milwaukee starter Jimmy Nelson allowed just three hits and an earned run while striking out five in eight innings.	"Outstanding ballgame," Milwaukee manager Ron Roenicke said. "It's a shame to get that kind of outing (and not get the win)."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: Pitcher Homer Bailey makes his second start of the season Thursday after surgery in September to repair the torn flexor tendon in his right forearm.	Brewers: Milwaukee has three starters on the disabled list. 2B Scooter Gennett was placed on the DL Tuesday, joining CF Carlos Gomez and C Jonathan Lucroy.	UP NEXT	Reds: Bailey (0-1) allowed five earned runs and nine hits in 5 2/3 innings in a 5-2 loss at St. Louis on Saturday.	Brewers: Kyle Lohse (0-3) is 7-5 with a 2.69 ERA in 20 career starts against Cincinnati.	MANAGER NOT ON HOT SEAT	Milwaukee owner Mark Attanasio addressed the media before the game and is not pleased with his team's start to the season.	"It's brutal," he said. "You turn on the TV every night and expect to see something different, and I know one of these nights we will."	Attanasio said Roenicke and general manager Doug Melvin were not on the hot seat.	"Right now, my examinations are focused on how to improve our performance on the field," Attanasio said. "Relative to me, I'm not looking at the manager or the general manager right now."

From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

PHOENIX -- Archie Bradley heard the bullpen phone ring, saw the activity behind the fence down the left field line. His third career start was not going well and a quick exit appeared to be on the horizon.	But after trying to be too fine in the strike zone, the Arizona rookie right-hander began pumping in strikes and ended up picking up a gut-check victory.	Bradley shook off a shaky start to pitch six effective innings, lifting the Arizona Diamondbacks to an 8-5 win over the Texas Rangers on Wednesday night.	"He stayed the course, really showed a lot of heart tonight," Diamondbacks manager Chip Hale said.	Sharp his first two starts, Bradley (2-0) labored against the Rangers, walking five in the first three innings, including one that scored a run. He proved to be effectively wild, though, holding the Rangers to a run and two hits to become fifth pitcher since 1914 to allow two hits or fewer in six-plus innings in two of his first three big league starts.	The Diamondbacks gave him plenty of help.	Chris Owings homered off Yovani Gallardo (2-1) and had a run-scoring single for the Diamondbacks. Mark Trumbo also drove in two runs.	Shortstop Nick Ahmed made some nifty defensive plays to help Arizona turn four double plays and the Diamondbacks outfielders ran down several balls deep in the gaps for outs.	The Rangers had three hits until the ninth inning before scoring four runs. Adrian Beltre hit a solo homer, the 397th of his career, but the Rangers missed too many opportunities early on against Bradley to be in position to complete a comeback.	"When a guy is missing that badly, you try to settle in and find a rhythm," Rangers manager Jeff Banister said. "We didn't get a hit and put a ball in play."	Bradley held his own in his first two big league starts, pitching six scoreless innings in a victory over reigning NL Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers and allowing two runs in 6 2/3 innings to outduel San Francisco's Madison Bumgarner in a no-decision.	Bradley had control issues in his third start, though some of it worked in his favor; the Rangers didn't have a hit until Gallardo's leadoff single in the fifth inning.	Bradley got two quick outs in the first inning, then walked three -- one scored a run -- and hit a batter in a 37-pitch first inning.	He worked around leadoff walks the next two innings and settled into a rhythm after that to win his third straight start against an opening day starter.	"You say you're not aware of it, but I heard the bullpen phone ring, I saw guys start getting loose and had to figure something out or I wasn't going to make it out of this first inning," Bradley said. "To have the long first and grind through six innings and have my team winning, that's the biggest job of a starting pitcher."	Gallardo labored in his opening day start, allowing four runs in four innings against Oakland, but looked better in wins over Houston and Seattle, allowing two combined runs in 11 2/3 innings.	He wasn't as sharp against Arizona.	The Diamondbacks scored a pair of runs off him in the first inning on consecutive high choppers and a throwing error by Beltre at third.	Trumbo had an RBI groundout in the third inning and added a run-scoring single in the fifth to put Arizona up 5-1. Owings led off the fourth inning with his first home since June 12, 2014, against Houston, and hit a run-scoring triple off Logan Verrett in the eighth.	Gallardo allowed five runs -- three earned -- and six hits and struck out five in five innings.	"I made some pretty good pitches but obviously the results weren't there," Gallardo said.	BRADLEY'S START	Bradley's ERA of 1.45 is the lowest in Arizona history for a pitcher in his first three career starts. He joins Travis Wood (2010), Ken Cloude (1997), Marvin Freeman (1986) and Wayne Simpson (1970) as the only pitchers to allow two hits in six-plus innings in two of his first three starts since 1914.	NUMBERS	Ahmed had a double in the fourth inning to end a 0-for-19 streak. ... Texas' Rougned Odor ended a 0-for-12 streak with a single in the seventh. ... Gallardo suffered his first loss (7-1) in 11 career starts against Arizona.	UP NEXT	Rangers: Texas has a day off before playing on Friday, when LHP Wandy Rodriguez will be called up from Triple-A Round Rock to start against the Los Angeles Angels. That will allow the Rangers, who have yet to use a fifth starter, give Colby Lewis some extra rest and push back Ross Detwiler. Texas will have to make a roster move when Rodriguez comes up.	Diamondbacks: RHP Josh Collmenter will start against Pittsburgh on Friday after tossing a four-hit shutout and getting a career-high three hits against San Francisco his previous start.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  The moment of truth for Sonny Gray came in the third inning with the bases loaded and one out. He passed that test against the meat of the Los Angeles Angels' lineup, and they couldn't touch him after that.	Gray outpitched Jered Weaver with seven innings of two-hit ball, and Billy Butler homered during a five-run seventh inning that carried the Oakland Athletics to a 9-2 victory over the defending AL West champions on Wednesday night.	"Sonny was great. For the most part, he's basically pitched the same game every time this year," manager Bob Melvin said. "He gets a strikeout when he needs one, gets the ball on the ground when he needs it, and his competitiveness shows up every time. He kicks it into another gear. And tonight he did it against some pretty tough customers."	The score was tied 1-all in the third when the Angels got a single by Johnny Giavotella and two walks. But Gray (2-0) struck out Albert Pujols on a slider in the dirt and got David Freese to pop up on a fastball.	"It was big to get out of that inning, facing the heart of their order," Gray said. "Getting Pujols to strike out was huge. I started throwing heaters in, and Pujols hit a couple of balls hard but foul. Then I threw a couple of good sliders and get him out in front of the ball to get a ground ball. With Freese, we went hard in and got him to jam himself just a little bit."	Pujols is now 1 for 16 lifetime against Gray, who struck out seven and retired his last 14 batters. The right-hander faced the Angels in three of his final eight starts last season, going at least seven innings each time.	"I want to go deep every time, whether the bullpen's fresh of not," he said. "I knew going in that the bullpen might be a little short tonight, but I don't think there was any more of an emphasis on it. It's just something I really want to do every time."	Eric Sogard greeted Fernando Salas (0-1) with a leadoff single in the seventh, stole second and advanced on Marcus Semien's sacrifice bunt before Stephen Vogt delivered the go-ahead run with a single through the right side off Cesar Ramos with one out and runners at the corners.	Vinnie Pestano came in to relieve and threw a wild pitch to Butler that allowed Sam Fuld to score. Butler drove a 3-1 pitch to center field for his 14th career homer against the Angels, and Brett Lawrie's run-scoring infield hit capped the rally.	The A's tacked on three more runs in the eighth and finished with 18 hits. They have outscored their opponents 62-5 in their eight victories, and have been outscored 56-21 in their eight losses -- including a 14-1 drubbing Tuesday night.	Oakland stole three more bases, making the A's 10 for 10 over their last eight games -- after playing their first eight games without attempting a stolen base.	Weaver threw 25 of his 93 pitches in the first inning and was done after six, allowing a run and eight hits with three strikeouts and no walks. The three-time All-Star, who won 18 games last year, is 0-2 in four starts with a 5.24 ERA. It's the first time in Weaver's 10 big league seasons that he was winless in his first four outings.	"I'm still trying to find my way, and it's getting better each and every time," Weaver said. "Tonight I had to battle all game and get out of some situations, so it might have taken a little bit out of me.	"I still felt like I wanted to go out there for the seventh, but it's Mike Scioscia's decision. That's what he wanted to do, and I'm more than happy to hand it over to the bullpen because we've got some great arms down there. I've just got to prove to him that I can get deeper in games."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: CF Coco Crisp, recovering from arthroscopic elbow surgery, took dry swings from both sides of the plate. ... 2B/OF Ben Zobrist missed his third straight game because of an injured left knee.	Angels: LHP C.J. Wilson, Thursday's scheduled starter, was pushed back to Saturday night against Texas because of elbow stiffness. ... Manager Mike Scioscia pulled back slightly from his statement on Tuesday that injured LF Josh Hamilton would begin extended spring training in Arizona during the weekend. "I was probably commenting a little bit more on the aggressive side of what the window could be, and it might not happen in that timetable. But there's really no confusion," Scioscia said. "I think the timetable for him to get to Arizona is really fluid. I don't think there are any mixed messages."	UP NEXT	Athletics: RHP Jesse Chavez (0-0) will start the series finale instead of RHP Jesse Hahn, who is being skipped one turn in the rotation because of a blister on his middle finger.	Angels: RHP Nick Tropeano will make his season debut on Thursday, after getting recalled from Triple-A Salt Lake when Matt Shoemaker was placed on the bereavement list due to the death of his grandfather.

SEATTLE --  Houston had plenty of opportunities Wednesday night, but each time the tying run reached third base, the Astros were unable to get the job done.	The failed chances eventually ran out and the Astros were unable to complete a three-game sweep against Seattle, falling 3-2 to the Mariners.	Down a run, Houston loaded the bases with two outs in the eighth off Mariners reliever Yoervis Medina, who had walked three in the inning. Chris Carter, who homered an inning earlier, struck out to end the threat.	The Astros then put runners on the corners with one out in the ninth after back-to-back singles by Jake Marisnick and Jose Altuve. But Seattle closer Fernando Rodney induced an infield popup and groundout to second to end the game and earn his fourth save in five tries.	"The last two innings definitely had every chance to get at least a tie, if not break it open," Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. "Give them credit. They made some pitches at the most opportune times."	The Seattle bullpen's ability to get through the final two innings unscathed preserved J.A. Happ's first win with the Mariners. Acquired in an offseason trade, Happ (1-1) won his third start. He gave up two runs and eight hits in 7 1/3 innings, walking none and striking out five.	Happ ran into trouble in the seventh after allowing a leadoff home run to Carter -- the first of the season for the slugger, who tied for second in the majors last year with 37 home runs -- and single to Colby Rasmus. Happ immediately induced a double play and got out of the inning with a fly ball.	After retiring the first batter of the eighth, Happ gave way to the bullpen.	"Just being aggressive and trying to get ahead of guys is big for me," Happ said. "Been able to throw strikes and get ahead of guys. That's the way I'm successful."	Houston starter Roberto Hernandez (0-2) stumbled early, but eventually settled down to pitch seven innings.	"In the first few innings the ball was kind of flat, but I was able to keep the ball down and started moving more and got comfortable," Hernandez said through an interpreter.	Austin Jackson singled, stole second and scored on Nelson Cruz's single to give the Mariners a 1-0 lead.	Mike Zunino hit a solo home run in the third and Brad Miller singled home Logan Morrison in the fourth to make it 3-0.	"Early, he was battling himself . very animated on the mound trying to catch his rhythm and get his pitches," Hinch said. "He breezed through the middle part of the game and then finished with seven strong."	Jose Altuve hit an RBI single with two outs in the Houston fifth to record his eighth RBI of the season.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: Hinch said RHP Brad Peacock, put on the 15-day disabled list Friday with a strained lat muscle, is dealing with a lengthy issue. Peacock injured his back in his first appearance after being reinstated from the disabled list	Mariners: Reliever Tom Wilhelmsen (hyperextended elbow) is expected to start playing catch Friday and throw a bullpen on the team's next road trip.	ZUNINO GOES YARD	Seattle's Mike Zunino hit a home run well beyond the left-field fence in the third inning for his second on the season. The home run was the first allowed by the Astros in six road contests this season.	HUDGENS TOSSED	Astros hitting coach Dave Hudgens was ejected in the middle of the fourth after Luis Valbuena was called out on strikes to end the top half of the inning.	"These are high intensity games," Hinch said. "Everybody has an opinion. We voiced our displeasure."	RARE LOSS FOR HOUSTON	The loss snaps a four-game win streak for the Astros. Despite the defeat, Houston has won its last two series and three of the last four.	UP NEXT	Astros: Houston has a day off Thursday before starting a three-game set at Oakland. LHP Dallas Keuchel (2-0) takes the mound for the Astros looking for his 11th consecutive quality start, a streak that dates to last August.	Mariners: Seattle gets a day off before ace Felix Hernandez takes the mound Friday against the Twins.

PITTSBURGH --  Gregory Polanco's maturation from prospect to entrenched major league starter remains a work in progress. The pace of the Pittsburgh Pirates outfielder's education, however, is picking up speed.	Facing Cubs reliever Phil Coke with the go-ahead run on second Thursday, Polanco quickly fell behind two strikes. The 6-foot-4 right fielder worked the count full then slapped a single to left field to drive in Josh Harrison with the go-ahead run in a 5-4 win.	Coke intentionally walked pinch-hitter Corey Hart to set up a lefty-on-lefty matchup with Polanco. Though Polanco didn't take the slight personally, it certainly provided ample motivation.	"You're more focused and you say, `I want to win this fight," Polanco said. "You always want to be ready every pitch because they walked the hitter before to try and make you out."	The hit was set up by Josh Harrison's second double of the game with one out. Chicago rookie Kris Bryant, a third baseman making a spot start in center while Dexter Fowler rested a groin injury, took a roundabout path to the ball, though Cubs manager Joe Maddon hardly placed the blame on Bryant.	"It took a left turn on him," Maddon said. "It was like a drawn 2-iron. It just hooked left. He had no chance at that."	Polanco finished 3 for 4 with two RBI. Sean Rodriguez hit his first homer with the Pirates as Pittsburgh rallied from a three-run deficit to manage a split of the four-game series.	"It was arguably for me today one of the best team wins since I've been here with what we had, what we went out there with, how we were able to battle," Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said.	Radhames Liz (1-1) picked up his first major league win since 2008 with two innings of shutout relief. Mark Melancon worked a perfect ninth for his third save.	Chris Denorfia and Starlin Castro each had two hits for the Cubs. Rookie second baseman Addison Russell doubled in a run for the first RBI of his career.	"We probably took the first two games away from them," Maddon said. "They took the last two away from us, that's how this division is going to play this year.	Brian Schlitter (0-2) gave up the double to Harrison with one out in the seventh. Polanco's single put the Pirates in front for the first time and the bullpen did the rest. Liz allowed just one hit in two innings to win for the first time since Sept. 14, 2008, when he played for Baltimore. Pittsburgh relievers retired the last eight Chicago batters.	Melancon, who struggled while blowing a save on Tuesday, had little trouble setting down Welington Castillo, Russell and Chris Coghlan as the Pirates ended an early 10-game homestand with a 6-4 mark.	LONG TIME COMING	Liz was a promising starter with the Orioles during his first tour in the big leagues. He went 6-6 in 2008 but found himself out of the majors by May 2009. His journey back to a roster spot included three years in Korea. The 31-year-old said he didn't give up hope he would make it all the way back.	"I know that's going to happen at some point," Liz said. "I just have to keep patient, try and do my job. You know, it's just what you keep in your heart. I believed."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: 2B Javier Baez was scheduled to report to the team's spring training complex in Mesa, Arizona, on Thursday. Baez has been on bereavement leave the last two weeks after the death of sister Noely on April 8.	Pirates: CF Andrew McCutchen didn't start on a scheduled day off before the start of a lengthy road trip. The plan was modified a bit when he struck out as a pinch hitter in the sixth. McCutchen is dealing with an achy left knee that the team will monitor. The 2013 NL MVP admitted he's not quite 100 percent but believes the pain is manageable. Hurdle said the team will look for chances to give McCutchen a break when possible.	UP NEXT	Cubs: The jewel of Chicago's spending spree over the winter will go for his first victory of the season when Jon Lester (0-2, 6.89) makes his fourth start as the Cubs begin a weekend series Friday night in Cincinnati. Lester gave up six runs on 10 hits in a no-decision against the Reds on April 13.	Pirates: Pittsburgh starts a nine-game road trip through Arizona, Chicago and St. Louis on Friday against the Diamondbacks. Gerrit Cole (2-0, 2.65 ERA) makes his first career start at Chase Field on Friday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PHILADELPHIA -- All the Miami Marlins needed to get on track was a trip to Philadelphia.	David Phelps tossed three-hit ball over seven innings, Martin Prado drove in four runs and Adeiny Hechavarria had four hits to help the Marlins beat the Phillies 9-1 Thursday.	A series that began with owner Jeffrey Loria declining to endorse manager Mike Redmond ended with hip-hop music blaring in the clubhouse and players in an upbeat mood.	"We had a couple rough weeks," Prado said. "We were swimming against the currents. Now, we are going with the flow, not trying to be a hero."	The announced crowd of 17,097 that came to see the two worst teams in the NL East on a chilly day was the smallest in the 11-year history of Citizens Bank Park.	"We've got some work to do," Phillies manager Ryne Sandberg said. "It was not a good game for us."	Giancarlo Stanton hit a two-run homer and Hechavarria drove in three runs for Miami, which has won two straight games after losing five in a row.	"We needed big hits in big situations," Redmond said. "We knew they were going to come. It was a matter of when."	Phelps (1-0) struck out five to earn his first win since joining the Marlins after three seasons with the Yankees. Cesar Hernandez hit a sacrifice fly off Nick Masset in the ninth to end the shutout bid.	"I don't think we can worry about the last seven. We have to focus on today and let it carry over," Phelps said.	Dustin McGowan (0-1) was roughed up in his first start for Philadelphia. He allowed four runs and three hits, walking four in 3 1/3 innings.	Hechavarria and Prado hit two-run singles in the fourth to give the Marlins a 4-0 lead.	McGowan walked the bases loaded before Hechavarria ended his day with a line-drive single. Reliever Hector Neris hit Phelps with a pitch and after Dee Gordon struck out, Prado bounced a single past third baseman Cody Asche to drive in two more for a 4-0 lead.	Prado hit a two-run double off Justin De Fratus in the sixth. Stanton then lined his fourth homer of the season through a strong wind into the left-field seats.	"I was just trying to keep it between the lines," Stanton said.	HECH'S HITTING	Hechavarria raised his average to .311 after starting the season 1 for 22. He has a six-game hitting streak and had hits in nine of 10 games on the road trip.	"You guys had him dead and buried after 20 at-bats," Redmond said. "We all knew he was going to hit. You just have to let him get going."	STREAKING SUZUKI	Ichiro extended his hitting streak against the Phillies to 11 games since June 4, 2003.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: LF Christian Yelich missed his third straight game because of tightness in his lower back.	Phillies: McGowan started because RHP Sean O'Sullivan was put on the 15-day disabled list Wednesday because of tendinitis in his left knee.	UP NEXT	Marlins: RHP Mat Latos (0-3, 10.24) starts against Washington's Jordan Zimmermann (1-2, 6.14) when the Marlins return home Friday night.	Phillies: RHP Aaron Harang (2-1, 1.96) faces his 2014 team when the Phillies host Atlanta on Friday.	JOSE'S BIG DAY	Marlins ace Jose Fernandez will become a U.S. citizen at a ceremony Friday in Miami. Fernandez, who left Cuba, is out until midseason recovering from Tommy John surgery.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DETROIT --  It was 33 degrees for the start at Comerica Park, and that turned out to be perfect conditions for the pitchers.	Masahiro Tanaka and the New York bullpen combined on a three-hitter Thursday as the Yankees stopped the Detroit Tigers 2-1.	Anibal Sanchez and the Tigers staff did fine, too, also allowing a total of three hits.	The day before, the Yankees romped 13-4 after taking a big lead in the first inning while snow flurries fell.	"When you win six of seven, a lot of it has to do with your starting pitching," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "They are holding teams down late into games and letting us get into the bullpen. From there, if you get a few timely hits, you win the game."	Jacoby Ellsbury began the eighth with a double off Tom Gorzelanny (0-1), took third on Brett Gardner's sacrifice bunt and scored on Brian McCann's groundout for the go-ahead run. The Yankees are now a season-best two games over .500.	Tanaka, who grew up in northern Japan, gave up one run and three hits in 6 1/3 innings. He walked two and struck out six.	"It was pretty cold out there," he said through a translator. "I spent my high school years in a really cold area, so as I was pitching, I was remembering those days."	Dellin Betances (3-0) picked up the win with 1 2/3 scoreless innings and Andrew Miller pitched a perfect ninth for his sixth save.	"I don't think the cold weather helps anyone," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said. "I'd bet that scoring is down in April across the board as opposed to the rest of the year."	Sanchez allowed one run on one hit and four walks in 6 1/3 innings, striking out eight. While his control wasn't great, it was a major improvement on his previous two starts, where he allowed 14 runs in 9 2/3 innings.	Detroit took the lead in the first inning on Victor Martinez's sacrifice fly, but the Yankees tied the game in the sixth on a strange play.	With a runner on third and two outs, Ellsbury bluffed toward home. Sanchez stepped off the rubber and threw home as Ellsbury retreated. None of the umpires made an immediate call, but after several Yankees visibly protested, third base umpire Gerry Davis called a balk.	"He started his delivery and then stepped off the rubber to throw home," Davis said. "I took a couple seconds to process what I saw. I wanted to be sure he had started his delivery before I made the call."	Ausmus came out to argue and was ejected by Davis, but acknowledged after the game that the call had been correct.	"It wasn't smooth, in terms of the timing, but Gerry got it right, so you can't really argue," he said.	The Yankees threatened again in the seventh, chasing Sanchez, but Gorzelanny got out of the inning with runners on first and second. The Tigers also had a chance in their half of the inning, but Chase Headley saved a run with a diving stop at third.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: DH Alex Rodriguez, who was 1 for 11 in the first three games of the series, got a scheduled rest day. Rodriguez had started 14 of New York's 15 games and pinch hit in the 15th.	Tigers: RHP Joe Nathan will miss the rest of the season after tearing the ulnar collateral ligament and the flexor pronator tendon in his pitching arm. The 40-year-old is expected to be sidelined for much of the 2016 season as well, but said Thursday that he hopes to continue his career.	UP NEXT	Yankees: Michael Pineda (2-0) faces Jacob deGrom (2-1) in the first game of a three-game home series against the Mets. The Yankees have lost the last four games between the teams at Yankee Stadium. The Mets have won a team record-tying 11 in a row.	Tigers: AL ERA leader Shane Greene (3-0, 0.39) goes against Danny Salazar (1-0, 3.00) to start a three-game home series against Cleveland. Detroit swept the Indians in a three-game series at Progressive Field from April 10-12.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

NEW YORK -- With a perfect ride through their first homestand, the surprising New York Mets matched the best start in team history.	Next stop, the Subway Series at Yankee Stadium -- and a shot at their longest winning streak ever.	Daniel Murphy drove in four runs and New York equaled a franchise record with its 11th straight victory Thursday, walking its way to a 6-3 win over the Atlanta Braves behind Bartolo Colon.	"I think it's so rewarding here in this clubhouse to kind of see the fruits of the labor over the last couple years, to see guys grow," Murphy said. "And I think it's such a reward for the fans who have been coming out."	The streaking Mets, with the top record in the majors despite injuries to captain David Wright and several other important players, are 10-0 at Citi Field after sweeping all their National League East rivals besides heavily favored Washington.	This is the fifth time the Mets have won 11 games in a row and the first since 1990. On two of those occasions, in 1969 and 1986, they won the World Series.	"It's a huge accomplishment," manager Terry Collins said. "I'm very proud of the guys. But it's over. We're going to enjoy it tonight, but we've got to get ready. We've got a tough road trip ahead of us starting on the other side of town."	Murphy hit an early three-run double, and the 41-year-old Colon outpitched All-Star Julio Teheran in a matchup of unbeaten starters. New York took advantage of eight walks and tied the 1986 World Series champions with a 13-3 start. That club also opened 2-3 before winning its next 11 games -- and 18 of 19.	After beginning this streak April 12 in Atlanta, Colon (4-0) overcame a blister on his middle finger Thursday by throwing virtually all fastballs while pitching in short sleeves on a chilly, 49-degree afternoon. He allowed three runs over six innings to win his first four starts for the first time in his career.	Colon has struck out 23 and walked one this season, becoming the first four-game winner in the big leagues. The last starting pitcher 40 or older to open 4-0 was Roger Clemens in 2004 with Houston.	"Everybody's chipping in. Everybody's doing their part," Colon said through a translator.	Jeurys Familia worked a hitless ninth for his major league-best eighth save in eight tries since taking over for injured and suspended closer Jenrry Mejia.	Andrelton Simmons had two RBIs for the Braves, who managed six runs in the three-game series. Teheran, the last pitcher to beat the Mets on April 11, walked five in 4 1/3 innings.	"I'm not worried about the offense," Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "I'm worried about our pitching and our bullpen a little bit right now."	Atlanta relievers Ian Thomas and Sugar Ray Marimon combined to issue three free passes in the fifth. Eric Campbell drew a bases-loaded walk from Marimon, who is Teheran's cousin, to force in the tiebreaking run.	Michael Cuddyer had an RBI groundout and Murphy added a run-scoring single to make it 6-3 in the seventh.	Teheran (2-1) walked three of his first four batters, and Murphy gave a big fist pump after his bases-clearing double to right.	"In each ballgame, no matter what happens, I feel like somebody's going to come through. And it's a really cool feeling to have," Murphy said. "It's a lot of fun in here right now. It's a lot of fun to be a Met."	PUT IT IN THE BOOKS	The Mets became the seventh team since 1900 to sweep a homestand of 10 or more games and the first since the 1991 Minnesota Twins, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. New York had never swept a homestand of seven or more games before.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Braves: Not often does a 38-year-old catcher play a night game and then start again the following afternoon, but that's what A.J. Pierzynski did. He went 3-for-3 with a walk Wednesday night then added two hits Thursday. He is batting .407 with three homers. "We're trying to win games," Gonzalez said, adding that he checked twice on Pierzynski, who said he was fine. "He's swingin' it."	Mets: Backup catcher Anthony Recker, wearing a blue wrap on his right arm, made his third start this year. The team announced Wednesday that he has a bone spur in the back of his right elbow that might be removed after the season.	UP NEXT	Braves: After busing down to Philadelphia, the Braves send LHP Alex Wood (1-0, 3.93 ERA) to the mound against RHP Aaron Harang (2-1, 1.96 ERA) in the opener of a three-game series Friday night. Wood had a 1.29 ERA in two starts against the Phillies last season, striking out 15 and walking one in 14 innings.	Mets: NL Rookie of the Year Jacob deGrom (2-1, 0.93 ERA) faces Michael Pineda (2-0, 5.00 ERA) in the Subway Series opener Friday night. In his major league debut, deGrom lost 1-0 to the Yankees at home in May. He has thrown 18 1/3 consecutive scoreless innings.	The Associated Press and ESPN Stats & Information contributed to this report.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MILWAUKEE --  Working quickly works best for Kyle Lohse.	Once he gets in a groove, the right-hander can be tough on any lineup.	The Milwaukee veteran bounced back from a poor start this season with seven neat innings, and the Brewers snapped an eight-game losing streak with 4-2 win on Thursday over the Cincinnati Reds.	Closer Francisco Rodriguez pumped his right arm and yelled after recording the final out. The win was a relief for the Brewers, whose 3-13 mark is the worst in the majors.	"We needed to get something going here," said Lohse, who allowed three hits and two runs. "I feel like it was a total team effort."	Marlon Byrd homered for the Reds, a two-run shot that tied it at 2 in the fifth.	Otherwise, Lohse (1-3) was in control. He worked ahead in counts with a sinker and slider in the early innings.	He then kept the Reds off balance with his fastball. With Lohse pounding the strike zone, hitters started swinging at pitches early in counts.	Lohse gave up three hits, walked one and struck out four.	"When I'm on, I want them to swing early. I want them to get those quick outs," said Lohse, who lost this first three starts with a 10.34 ERA.	Jean Segura drove in the go-ahead run with a two-out single in the seventh. The hit off Kevin Gregg (0-2) went to center field, and Billy Hamilton's throw home was up the third base line, allowing Logan Schafer to score.	The Brewers tacked on an insurance run in the eighth off reliever Manny Parra when Ryan Braun stole third and dashed home after third baseman Kristopher Negron allowed the throw from catcher Tucker Barnhart to squirt away.	"We have to come in throwing strikes and challenging opponents," Reds manager Bryan Price said. "We've taken some leads into the late innings and they've gotten away from us so we have to be better."	Reds starter Homer Bailey gave up two runs in 5 2/3 innings in his second start since coming off the disabled list on April 18 with a right forearm injury.	CLOSING TIME	Setup man Jonathan Broxton struck out the side in the eighth.	Rodriguez posted his second save of the season and 350th of his career. He gave up a two-out double to Zack Cozart before Joey Votto, who was hitting .386 with six homers, hit a harmless bouncer to second to end the game.	SLOWED DOWN	The Brewers also escaped without giving up a run despite allowing Hamilton, the Reds' speedy leadoff man, to reach base twice.	Hamilton was 9 of 9 on stolen base attempts coming into the day before Martin Maldonado became the first catcher to throw him out. Maldonado nailed Hamilton at second in the sixth with the game tied at 2.	"Lohse did a great job varying his times to the plate. He was very, very quick to the plate. Maldonado can throw well so I was hoping we would get an off-speed pitch there," Price said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: Price said he was looking for consistency from Bailey. The right-hander, Price said, was fine physically, but needed to build his endurance back up.	"I think he managed the game better," Price said. "I don't think he had as good of stuff as far as sheer velocity, but I think this is kind of the road we're going to travel until he's 100 percent."	Brewers: Maldonado will play every day until he needs a day off, manager Ron Roenicke said. Maldonado is replacing Jonathan Lucroy, who is expected to spend at least a month on the disabled list with a fractured big left toe. ... Rodriguez appeared to be fine after the reliever tweaked his right wrist on a play at the plate that allowed the go-ahead run to score off his wild pitch the previous night. The Reds won 2-1.	UP NEXT	Reds: Mike Leake (0-1) gets the start against the Cubs with Cincinnati opening a six-game homestand. Leake is 4-0 with a 2.45 ERA in his last six starts against Chicago.	Brewers: Matt Garza (1-2) opens a three-game set against the St. Louis Cardinals. Opponents are hitting .300 (21 for 70) against the right-hander this season.	---	Follow Genaro Armas at http://twitter.com/GArmasAP	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

DENVER --  Corey Dickerson's left heel has flared up along with his power.	Even he is a little baffled by the correlation.	Dickerson hit a go-ahead home run leading off the fifth inning and Jordan Lyles pitched effectively into the seventh, helping the Colorado Rockies to a 2-1 win over the San Diego Padres on Thursday.	Dickerson connected for his third solo shot in two days despite playing with pain caused by plantar fasciitis. Dickerson, who scored both runs, was removed in the eighth when the Rockies made a double switch. He said it was purely for precautionary reasons.	"I'm not too worried about it," said Dickerson, who didn't start Tuesday because of his bothersome foot. "I just try to put it in the back of my mind."	His homer off Tyson Ross (1-1) was a big lift on a day when runs were scarce. This was the 25th time a game at Coors Field ended in a 2-1 score, according to the Rockies.	Lyles (2-1) adjusted his mechanics for this start, resisting the urge to fall toward the first-base side when he uncorked his fastball. That led to better control as he shut down one of baseball's top-hitting teams, allowing one run and six hits in 6 2/3 innings.	"Overall, I thought we made great strides and effort of limiting mistakes -- walks and unnecessary walks -- that I've had earlier this season," Lyles explained.	Ross struggled with his command but found ways to minimize the damage. He surrendered two runs in five innings, then was pulled after 106 pitches. He walked four and struck out seven as he fell to 0-5 against Colorado.	"He threw some pitches that I thought from the side looked real close," Padres manager Bud Black said. "Some real borderline pitches that didn't go his way. But at the end of the day he gave us a chance to win, even though he wasn't at the top of his game."	Yonder Alonso kept up his hot hitting with three singles, including one in the fourth that drove in San Diego's run.	Lyles had runners on first and second with two outs in the seventh, when he was pulled for Scott Oberg. Recently recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque, Oberg struck out pinch-hitter Justin Upton with a 95-mph fastball to end the threat.	AXFORD'S BIG DAY	John Axford struck out Alexi Amarista to end the game and earn his second save. But that wasn't the highlight.	Earlier in the day, his 2-year-old son Jameson had a procedure on his right foot that "went well." His son was bitten twice by a rattlesnake last month in the yard of the house his family rented in Scottsdale, Arizona, for spring training. Jameson recently returned home after spending four weeks in the hospital for treatment.	"Now that my son is home, we get to spend some quality time together," Axford said.	WHO'S ON FIRST	With Justin Morneau getting a breather and Wilin Rosario optioned to Albuquerque on Wednesday, the Rockies were in a predicament at first base. They had versatile infielder Daniel Descalso start at the spot for the fourth time in his big league career.	Solid most of the day, Descalso struggled with his footwork on a pivotal play in the fourth. DJ LeMahieu stopped Matt Kemp's grounder up the middle with two outs and Descalso couldn't quite keep his foot on the bag when he caught the throw. Alonso lined an RBI single to left that brought home Kemp to tie it at 1-apiece.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: Ian Kennedy (strained left hamstring) is to start Saturday against Los Angeles. Odrisamer Despaigne returns to the bullpen. ... Black kept Upton out of the starting lineup so he could rest his sore left quadriceps.	Rockies: Manager Walt Weiss no longer holds his breath in fear of a possible injury when shortstop Troy Tulowitzki dives for a ball or stretches a single into a double. "I think it's because I'm getting used to him running around like his old self," Weiss said of Tulowitzki, who played in 91 games last season before having hip surgery.	UP NEXT	Padres: RHP Andrew Cashner (1-2, 2.65) takes the mounds Friday as the Padres return home for a three-games series with Los Angeles. Righty Zack Greinke (2-0, 1.83) goes for the Dodgers.	Rockies: Righty Eddie Butler (2-1, 2.25) opens a three-game set against San Francisco. The Giants counter with righty Chris Heston (2-1, 0.87).	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

Maxwell was robbed of a big hit in his previous at-bat, but his single with one out in the 10th inning sent the San Francisco Giants to a 3-2 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers Thursday for a three-game sweep.	In the eighth inning, with the bases loaded and two outs, Maxwell smacked a liner up the middle, but second baseman Howie Kendrick made a diving catch to end the threat and preserve a 2-1 Dodger lead.	"I go into every at-bat looking to hit the ball hard. I was ready to hit," Maxwell said of his winning single. "Winning is fun. I can't wait to get on the plane and celebrate with the team."	A day after they edged the Dodgers by the same 3-2 score with a run in the ninth, the Giants again frustrated their division rivals.	"It was a great series," Giants' manager Bruce Bochy said. "It could have gone either way the last two games. It's been a tough homestand and this made it not so bad."	The Giants rallied to score the tying run in the ninth when Casey McGehee led off with a single and Brandon Crawford tripled against Joel Peralta.	Juan Nicasio (0-1) gave up a single to Angel Pagan to open the 10th and got Buster Posey on a fly out. Pagan stole second and Brandon Belt was walked intentionally ahead of Maxwell.	"Angel is our catalyst," Bochy said. "He's a tough out and he gives us speed. He got us going and got the stolen base. He looked determined to get home."	Santiago Casilla (2-0) pitched the 10th for the win as the Giants swept the Dodgers at home for the first time since May 2013. The defending World Series champions have won four of five following an eight-game losing streak.	"This shows you what this year is going to be, how this division is going to be," Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said. "Buckle up."	The Dodgers had brought a seven-game winning streak into AT&T Park.	Pagan, Maxwell and Joe Panik each had two hits for the Giants.	Alex Guerrero homered and singled and is batting .474 (9 for 19) with four homers and 12 RBIs for the Dodgers. Adrian Gonzalez also homered.	Los Angeles starter Mike Bolsinger, who did not allow a run in 11 minor league innings, took a shutout into the sixth. He finished allowing one run on five hits. He walked two and struck out five.	Bolsinger, the reigning PCL Player of the Week, was recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma City to make the start.	Giants starter Ryan Vogelsong gave up two runs on three hits in six innings. He walked one and struck out five.	In the sixth, Bolsinger gave up a one-out walk to Panik and a single to Pagan. After Posey struck out, Belt singled home a run.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: C A.J. Ellis, pulled from Wednesday's loss with a bruised right hand, did not play. X-rays were negative and he's expected to be ready by Friday.	Giants: OF Hunter Pence (fractured left forearm) is swinging off a tee with a wooden bat. He had been using a wiffle bat. ... RHP Erik Cordier (right forearm strain) has made three rehab appearances for Single-A San Jose, totaling three scoreless innings with seven strikeouts. INF Travis Ishikawa (lower back strain) had a setback and will be rested.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: RHP Zack Greinke (2-0, 1.83) takes the mound against the Padres in San Diego on Friday. He's 2-0 in with a 1.74 ERA in five career starts at Petco Park.	Giants: RHP Chris Heston (2-1, 0.87) gets the start against the Colorado Rockies on Friday in Denver. Heston is the first Giants rookie to start a season with outings of at last six innings and one or fewer earned runs since 1914.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

WASHINGTON -- One of these days, Michael Wacha might be the guy who forces the other team's starting pitcher to excel.	For now, the St. Louis Cardinals right-hander is having a delightful time trying to outdo the opposing team's ace.	Wacha got the best of Max Scherzer, Matt Adams singled in the tiebreaking run in the sixth inning and the Cardinals beat the Washington Nationals 4-1 Thursday for their fourth straight series win.	In his previous two starts, Wacha outpitched Cincinnati star Johnny Cueto. This time, he was better than Scherzer -- the 2013 Cy Young winner who came in with a sparkling 0.83 ERA.	"You know you're going to have to go out there and try to match zeros against those guys," Wacha said.	He did better than that.	Wacha (3-0) allowed one run and five hits in seven innings while lowering his ERA to 1.33. He walked two and struck out six, including Jose Lobaton three times.	"He was great," manager Mike Matheny said. "I think he's doing a nice job of not being distracted by who he's facing."	Scherzer (1-2) also went seven innings, giving up two runs and six hits. It was the first time in his four starts with Washington that he surrendered more than one earned run.	Scherzer hurt his wrist in the fifth inning while at the plate, but he dismissed the injury as a minor inconvenience.	"I haven't batted too much and I jammed it a little bit," the right-hander said. "I look forward to going out there and pitching my next start."	Nationals first baseman Ryan Zimmerman was slow on the bases, a shortcoming that manager Matt Williams suspected was a minor case of plantar fasciitis.	"He has a little pain in the bottom of his foot," Williams said. "Been bothering him for a while. Pretty soon we're going to have to give him a break and sit him down."	Matt Carpenter had two hits and scored a run for the Cardinals, who have won seven of eight. St. Louis took two of three from the Nationals in a matchup of 2014 division champions and remained unbeaten in series play this year (4-0-1).	Scherzer allowed the first two batters to reach base, then retired 16 of 17 before Jason Heyward singled with two outs in the sixth. The right-hander hit Matt Holliday with a pitch before Adams delivered a single to left for a 2-1 lead.	St. Louis added two runs in the eighth.	Jordan Walden got three outs in the bottom of the inning for the Cardinals and Trevor Rosenthal pitched a perfect ninth for his sixth save.	Facing the Cardinals for the first time since 2009, Scherzer, a St. Louis native, got off to a wobbly start. Carpenter lined the first pitch of the game into center field for a double, moved up on a single by Heyward and scored on a wild pitch.	In the Nationals fifth, Danny Espinosa led off with a double and Scherzer reached when a replay determined that Adams took his foot off first base before taking a throw. Denard Span followed with an RBI single.	With runners on the corners, Wacha retired Ian Desmond on a popup, struck out Bryce Harper and got Zimmerman to ground into a fielder's choice.	HAVE A SEAT	Cardinals: C Yadier Molina was out of the starting lineup for the first time this season, despite a seven-game stretch in which he had 12 hits and six RBIs. "We had (the non-start) on the calendar a while back," Matheny said.	Nationals: OF Jayson Werth didn't play after going 4 for 19 in his previous five games. The slugger is batting .167 with no homers and two RBIs.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: OF Peter Bourjos is expected to return from paternity leave on Friday in Milwaukee.	Nationals: OF Anthony Rendon (left knee sprain) worked out the squad before the game and will start a rehabilitation assignment Friday with Double-A Harrisburg.	UP NEXT	Cardinals: RHP Carlos Martinez (1-0, 2.08 ERA) gets his third start of the season Friday night in the opener of a three-game set against the Brewers.	Nationals: Washington sends Jordan Zimmermann and his 6.14 ERA to the mound vs. the Marlins to launch a 10-game road trip that goes through Miami, Atlanta and New York.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  After Nick Tropeano shut down the Oakland Athletics in a dazzling debut, three relievers escaped big jams with the help of some stellar defense.	When the Los Angeles Angels play this well otherwise, one hit is plenty.	Tropeano pitched five-hit ball into the seventh inning, and Kole Calhoun's two-run homer was the Angels' only hit in a 2-0 victory Thursday night.	Calhoun homered in the third, and four pitchers combined on an eight-hit shutout that allowed the Angels to salvage a split a four-game series with their upstate AL West rivals. The Angels didn't have a baserunner after the third inning, but won with just one hit for the third time in franchise history, the first since June 16, 1986.	"Two runs, but that's all the pitching staff needed," Calhoun said. "That's huge for us. Today is really all about the pitching staff."	Tropeano (1-0) was impressive in a spot start, yielding one walk and striking out five less than 48 hours after learning he was headed to the majors. Given the chance in Anaheim by C.J. Wilson's stiff elbow and Matt Shoemaker's bereavement leave, Tropeano showed off his nasty changeup and improved as the game went along, leaving to a standing ovation after Josh Reddick's leadoff single in the seventh.	"I was obviously ecstatic to know I'm pitching in the big leagues, at the Big A, but I think you've just got to approach it like any other start," Tropeano said. "I started pounding that first strike, and it opened things up for me."	He was nearly matched by Jesse Chavez (0-1), who gave up one hit and three walks in six innings during his first start of the season.	But that hit was costly: Calhoun drove a one-out pitch to right after Drew Butera reached on a throwing error.	"We held on," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "They gave us a little break with the error, Kole connected, and that was about it. ... I've seen us lose on a no-hitter. Winning on a one-hitter was a lot better."	Fernando Salas escaped a jam with two runners on in the seventh, and Joe Smith narrowly got out of the eighth when Calhoun tracked down Reddick's drive to the right-field wall with two on.	Huston Street pitched the ninth for his fifth save, though he allowed his first baserunner of the season on Marcus Semien's two-out infield single. Collin Cowgill made a sprinting catch in foul territory to end a frustrating day for Oakland, which went 5-5 on its road trip.	Chavez began the season in Oakland's bullpen, but largely mowed down the Angels in his return to the rotation. After the rocky third that included two walks, he retired his final nine batters.	"To give up one hit on a moment's notice to make a start, I don't know how you can ask much more than that," A's manager Bob Melvin said. "I can't remember the last time we got beat by one hit."	Oakland hadn't lost a game while giving up only one hit since April 14, 1992, at Kansas City.	SHORT TRIP?	Scioscia isn't sure what the Angels will do with Tropeano after his second major-league victory, since their rotation is full. Los Angeles traded backup catcher Hank Conger to the Astros last winter to get Tropeano, who made four major-league starts last September. The Long Island native competed for the fifth spot in the Angels' rotation in spring training, but Hector Santiago won the spot. "We've got a lot of guys in the bullpen that are tired, so we'll look where everybody is," Scioscia said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: Chavez got the start in place of Jesse Hahn, who has a blister. ... Ben Zobrist fouled out to end the game, also ending his 18-game hitting streak against the Angels. He didn't play in the first three games after getting a cortisone shot in his left knee.	Angels: Wilson's scheduled start was pushed to Saturday. The left-hander doesn't expect his elbow to be a problem this weekend or long-term.	UP NEXT	Athletics: Scott Kazmir takes the mound when Oakland opens a weekend series at the Coliseum against Dallas Keuchel and Houston.	Angels: Garrett Richards makes his second start of his comeback from surgery when the Angels open a three-game home series against the Texas Rangers.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

TORONTO --  After a pair of abbreviated outings, Drew Hutchison delivered a dominant start.	Josh Donaldson hit a two-run homer, Hutchison pitched eight strong innings and the Toronto Blue Jays completed a three-game sweep of Baltimore, beating the Orioles 7-6 on Thursday night.	Hutchison (2-0) was perfect through five innings before Manny Machado drilled a first-pitch homer in the sixth.	"He was sticking it pretty good tonight," manager John Gibbons said of Hutchison. "He really gave us what we needed."	Hutchison allowed two runs and four hits, walked none and struck out a season-high seven in the longest outing by a Blue Jays starter this season.	The right-hander had failed to finish the fifth in his either of his past two starts.	"We've got to take our caps off to Hutchison," Machado said. "He was throwing a lot of strikes. He was commanding his sliders, he was throwing his fastball well."	After his previous outing, Hutchison said he was embarrassed not to have done better. He had nothing to be ashamed of against the Orioles.	"I felt like I did a good job of being aggressive in the zone," Hutchison said. "I was able to pound my fastball early and get ahead of guys and that was the difference."	Toronto won for the fourth time in five games and finished its season opening homestand at 5-5. The Orioles have lost four straight.	"We're already putting it behind us," Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said. "You have to."	Machado added a three-run drive off Miguel Castro in the ninth. It was the third multihomer game of his career.	Castro got the final two outs for his fourth save.	Rookie Devon Travis opened the scoring with a fielder's choice grounder in the third and Donaldson followed with a drive off the facing of the third deck in left, his fourth.	The Blue Jays added three more in the fourth. Danny Valencia doubled home a run and Kevin Pillar hit a two-run double that bounced off the third base bag.	Orioles right-hander Chris Tillman (2-2) left after issuing a one-out walk to Justin Smoak in the fifth. Russell Martin greeted reliever Brad Brach with an RBI double to make it 7-0.	Tillman allowed seven runs and five hits in 4 1/3 innings. He's 0-2 with an 18.00 ERA in two starts against Toronto.	"My command killed me tonight," Tillman said.	Travis Snider hit a fielder's choice grounder in the seventh and an RBI single off Liam Hendriks in the ninth.	CATCHER CAROUSEL	The Blue Jays placed C Dioner Navarro on the 15-day disabled list with a strained left hamstring and recalled C Josh Thole from Triple-A Buffalo. Navarro suffered the injury trying to stretch a single into a double in the seventh inning of Tuesday's 13-6 win. Thole, whose specialty is catching the knuckleball, is expected to make his season debut in R.A. Dickey's start at Tampa Bay on Friday.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: 2B Ryan Flaherty was held out of the lineup with a sore right groin, suffered on the final play of Wednesday's game. With 2B Jonathan Schoop (right knee) and SS J.J. Hardy (left shoulder) already on the disabled list, the Orioles have limited options in the middle infield. Showalter said Flaherty could land on the DL if his condition doesn't improve.	Blue Jays: OF Jose Bautista (right shoulder) missed his second straight game but was feeling much better Thursday and is unlikely to require a stint on the DL. Gibbons said Bautista will likely DH for a couple of days upon his return to the lineup.	UP NEXT	Orioles: Baltimore returns home Friday to begin a three-game series against Boston. Orioles RH Miguel Gonzalez (2-1) faces Red Sox RH Rick Porcello (1-2) in the opener. Porcello allowed eight runs and 12 hits in five innings against Baltimore in his last start, raising his ERA from 3.86 to 6.63.	Blue Jays: Toronto travels to Florida to begin a three-game series with the Tampa Bay Rays on Friday. Blue Jays righty R.A. Dickey (0-1) faces Rays lefty Drew Smyly in the opener. Smyly is coming off the disabled list to make his first start of the season after being out since spring training with shoulder tendinitis.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Rene Rivera could finally celebrate a big hit after early-season struggles.	He had a run-scoring single in the bottom of the ninth and the Tampa Bay Rays beat the Boston Red Sox 2-1 on Thursday night.	"I think any walkoff is great," said Rivera, who is hitting .135 after going 1 for 3. "You win the game. You enjoy it. It's a great feeling."	Allan Dykstra opened the ninth with a single off Anthony Varvaro (0-1). Pinch-runner Tim Beckham went to second on Kevin Kiermaier's one-out single and scored the winning run on Rivera's hit down the third-base line.	Brad Boxberger (2-1) struck out one during a perfect ninth for the win.	The Rays have won two in a row after dropping the four first games of a nine-game homestand.	"A big night for Rene," Rays manager Kevin Cash said. "He needed that, we needed that. I'm sure he's feeling pretty good."	Tampa Bay's Jake Odorizzi gave up one run, three hits, three walks and had three strikeouts in 6 2/3 innings.	Clay Buchholz allowed one run and two hits over six innings for Boston. He struck out 10 and walked three.	Buchholz didn't allow a run over 21 innings in his previous three road starts against the Rays, dating to 2012. The streak ended when the Rays tied it at 1 in the second on an RBI single by Logan Forsythe.	Boston opened the scoring earlier in the second on Daniel Nava's sacrifice fly.	Kiermaier made a diving catch in center charging toward the infield after first breaking the wrong way on Mookie Betts' fly with two on and two outs in the fifth.	"It's amazing the ground that man can cover," Cash said.	Brandon Gomes struck out the only batter he faced, pinch-hitter Hanley Ramirez, after falling behind 3-0 with two on to end the seventh.	"We got shutdown tonight," Boston manager John Farrell said. "Credit their guys. They didn't fall behind in the count. We had a couple of opportunities. I thought Hanley had an opportunity there, and Gomes makes a quality 3-2 pitch with a changeup for strike three."

CHICAGO -- The Kansas City Royals stayed in their fighting mood. They also stayed in their winning mood.	A benches-clearing fight led to five ejections several innings before Eric Hosmer hit the go-ahead double in the 13th to lead the Royals to a 3-2 win over the Chicago White Sox on Thursday night.	With two outs, Hosmer's hit off Chicago's Jake Petricka (0-1) brought in Jarrod Dyson. Wade Davis then pitched a scoreless 13th for his fourth save, giving Franklin Morales (2-0) the victory.	That gave Kansas City a win for the fourth time in five games, during a night that tempers flared.	"With two or three scrums going on you're always worried about somebody getting hurt," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "I found myself at the bottom of one of those piles. It's not fun being down there."	He got to the bottom of a pile after what looked like a routine play.	In the seventh, Yordano Ventura snagged a grounder from Chicago outfielder Adam Eaton and they appeared to exchange words before Ventura threw to first to end the inning. Eaton had to be restrained from Ventura, who was ejected from a second straight start.	Players from both dugouts and bullpens ran onto the field and punches were thrown during a fight that lasted a couple of minutes.	"It was a messy situation," Ventura said through a translator.	Chicago pitcher Jeff Samardzija was one of five ejected, and his actions didn't gain the Royals' approval.	"For me, I'm not a big fan. I'm not a big fan of him," said Lorenzo Cain, who was tossed. "I don't know what the deal is."	The play was the culmination of tensions that seemed to rise during the game and carry over from their season-opening series earlier this month when the teams combined to hit six batters. In the bottom of the fourth, Ventura hit Jose Abreu. In the top of the fifth, Chris Sale hit Mike Moustakas.	Ventura was thrown out after the fight. On Saturday, after he allowed a three-run homer to the Athletics' Josh Reddick, he hit Brett Lawrie and was ejected.	The four others tossed Thursday were Cain and pitcher Edinson Volquez for Kansas City, along with Chicago's Sale and Samardzija.	"This game's emotional and it seems to follow them around. It's happened often enough," Chicago manager Robin Ventura said. "Everybody gets emotional and reacts to things, and that's what happened."	For Yordano Ventura, it was his fourth consecutive start that ended abruptly. Besides the ejections, on opening day against the White Sox he left with a thumb cramp. He was replaced April 12 against the Los Angeles Angels because of a right calf cramp.	Ventura said he "recognizes that some of his actions are not putting himself in a favorable light, as well as the team."	Kansas City has been in a fighting mood for a week now, something Chicago knows.	"They've earned everything they've gotten and now they want to keep it. You don't expect anything less," Eaton said. "With the other beef with other teams, I'm not sure. I've heard some things."	In that three-game series against Oakland last weekend, the Royals and A's cleared their benches each day. Nearly as many people were hit by pitches as hit home runs. And five players and coaches were ultimately thrown out of the finale Sunday, when things boiled over.	Yost doesn't want what happened Thursday to carry over.	"Hopefully it's all behind us and we can move forward," he said.	Before the fight, Ventura pitched seven innings and allowed two runs while striking out eight. Sale only gave up two first-inning runs and lasted seven innings and allowed nine hits.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals: INF Omar Infante (left groin) was not in the lineup. He left Sunday's game after suffering the injury and hasn't appeared since, though manager Ned Yost said "he's getting to the point where he's getting ready to play." . Yost said RHP Greg Holland (right pectoral muscle) will be evaluated Saturday. . RHP Luke Hochevar (right elbow) threw a scoreless inning during a rehab assignment at Triple-A Omaha.	White Sox: Petricka (right forearm) made his debut Wednesday and said he felt "great" before Thursday's game. "Normal soreness. That's a great feeling," Petricka said.	UP NEXT	Royals LHP Danny Duffy (1-0, 5.51) faces White Sox LHP Jose Quintana (1-1, 8.40). Duffy is 1-1 with a 3.72 ERA at U.S. Cellular Field, while Quintana is 0-6 with a 4.66 ERA in 13 starts against Kansas City.	ALL HANDS	Unlike the Royals' season-opening sweep of the White Sox, Chicago had Sale and Petricka available. Robin Ventura said "you want everything you got" when facing the Royals, who entered Thursday having won three of four. "You just always want to feel complete when you're competing with somebody as good as these guys," Ventura said.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

BALTIMORE --  Batting in the eighth inning of a tie game, Brock Holt wasn't trying to emulate teammate David Ortiz.	It just turned out that way.	Holt hit a tiebreaking, three-run homer off Darren O'Day, and the Boston Red Sox beat Baltimore 7-5 Friday night to extend the Orioles' losing streak to five games.	Ortiz also connected with two runners on, and Hanley Ramirez added a solo shot for the Red Sox, who have won three of five this season against the defending AL East champions.	Ortiz is known for hitting long balls. Holt is not. Although the 5-foot-10, 180-pound Holt was batting eighth in the lineup and hadn't gone deep since Sept. 4, he broke open a 4-all game with a drive over the right-field scoreboard.	"It was just the same approach that I normally have -- trying to get a good pitch to hit and hitting it hard somewhere," Holt said. "He just left the fastball up and over the plate, and fortunately I was able to hit it out."	Jimmy Paredes and Chris Davis homered for the last-place Orioles, whose five-game skid is their longest since September 2013.	"We've got to grind through it," manager Buck Showalter said.	After Tommy Hunter retired the first two Boston batters in the eighth, Brian Matusz (0-2) walked Pablo Sandoval. Pinch-hitter Allen Craig followed with a sharp bouncer off O'Day that skipped past third baseman Manny Machado, who was charged with an error.	"Manny's as good a third baseman as you can find," Showalter said. "He's bailed us out a lot of times."	Holt then brought home three unearned runs with his fifth career homer.	"It was fun," Holt said. "We needed to get some runs there."	Alexi Ogando (1-0) struck out Machado with two outs and the bases loaded in the seventh after Everth Cabrera hit a tying sacrifice fly.	Junichi Tazawa gave up a solo shot to Davis in the eighth, but Koji Uehara worked the ninth for his third save.	Miguel Gonzalez allowed four runs and eight hits in six innings for Baltimore. It was only the fifth time in his last 30 starts that the right-hander yielded as many as four earned runs.	Boston starter Rick Porcello gave up four runs and six hits in six-plus innings. In his previous outing, also against Baltimore, the right-hander allowed eight runs and a career-high 12 hits.	Porcello struck out the first five batters he faced and didn't give up a hit until Machado singled with one out in the fourth. Paredes followed with a shot to right for a 2-0 lead.	The advantage didn't last long.	Gonzalez retired the first two batters in the fifth before Mookie Betts walked and Dustin Pedroia singled to set the stage for Boston's first back-to-back homers of the season. Ortiz hit a three-run drive to right that barely cleared the outstretched glove of a leaping Delmon Young, and Ramirez crushed a no-doubt shot to left.	Baltimore got a run back in the bottom half when Rey Navarro doubled and scored on a single by Cabrera. Navarro was playing in his first major league game after a long run in the minors that began in 2007.	STAT PACK	Red Sox: Boston was 12 for 12 on stolen base attempts before Pedroia was caught in the seventh inning, confirmed by replay. ... The Red Sox reached double digits in hits for the first time in nine games. ... Boston has won all six of its series openers. ... Ortiz has six homers in his last 12 games in Baltimore.	Orioles: Baltimore has 24 homers in 17 games. ... Davis has nearly twice as many strikeouts (27) as hits (14). ... In six games since being activated from the disabled list, Paredes is 8 for 25 (.320) with two homers and six runs scored.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: RF Shane Victorino missed a second straight game with a sore right hamstring. The injury occurred Wednesday night against Tampa Bay.	Orioles: Baltimore placed INF Ryan Flaherty on the 15-day disabled list with a right groin strain and recalled Navarro from Triple-A Norfolk.	UP NEXT	Red Sox: Justin Masterson (2-0, 5.74 ERA) seeks his second win over the Orioles in a five-day span Saturday night.	Orioles: Wei-Yin Chen (0-1, 3.07 ERA) issued five walks and gave up five unearned runs in a loss to Boston on Monday. ... Showalter will miss Saturday's game to attend the funeral of his father-in-law.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK -- On a night that felt more like October than late April, Michael Pineda gave the Yankees an impressive performance in a matchup all of New York could get behind in the World Series.	Pineda consistently threw deceptive strikes into the eighth inning, Mark Teixeira had a pair of two-run homers and the Yankees ended the crosstown rival Mets' 11-game winning streak with a 6-1 victory Friday night in the Subway Series opener.	"He's dominant," Yankees catcher Brian McCann said of the powerful right-hander.	Jacoby Ellsbury also connected off Jacob deGrom (2-2) for a third home run to the short right field in the Bronx as the Yankees ended a four-game home skid to the Mets.	Pineda (3-0) allowed five hits and a run in 7⅔ innings in his longest outing with the Yankees, who won for the seventh time in eight games. The NL East-leading Mets lost in their first game this season against a team outside the division.	"He's matured. He took a tough situation last year and figured out how to pitch in the cold," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said, referring to when Pineda was caught using pine tar at Boston. "On a night like tonight, it was extremely impressive."	For the first time since the start of interleague play in 1997, the teams entered a Subway Series game with each holding at least a share of first place in their divisions. Even with the Rangers playing an NHL playoff game at Madison Square Garden and the Islanders and Nets also in the postseason, baseball was abuzz in New York on a brisk, 46-degree night.	The banged-up Mets were coming off a perfect 10-game homestand that gave them the best record in baseball at 13-3, matching the 1986 team for best start in franchise history.	"It's disappointing because we were on a nice roll," Mets manager Terry Collins said, "and I know the Yankees have been playing very well, but we're surprised when Jake doesn't have his good stuff, and tonight he didn't have it."	While the Mets were playing in front of packed houses at Citi Field that started talk of a shift in the balance of New York baseball toward the club from Queens for the first time in more than 20 years, the Yankees were on a run of their own. They returned from a 7-3 road trip, including taking three of four in Detroit, tied with Boston atop the AL East after losing four of five to open the season.	And the Bronx Bombers quickly showed they're not ceding any bragging rights in the Big Apple.	Bernie Williams, who caught the final out of the 2000 Subway World Series, threw out the ceremonial first pitch, and then Pineda shut down the Mets with pinpoint control of his nasty breaking pitch. He struck out seven and didn't walk a batter, throwing 78 of his 100 pitches for strikes.	"That's what I'm looking for, attack the hitter for a first-pitch strike," Pineda said.	Teixeira homered in the first, a soaring shot down the right-field line that appeared to get some help from the gusting wind to keep it fair.	That drive ended an 18⅓-inning scoreless stretch for deGrom that began after he gave up a first-inning homer in his first start of the season. Teixeira hit a similar drive in the third three batters after Ellsbury barely cleared the right-field wall, 314 feet from home plate. The three homers matched the most deGrom has yielded in his career.	"I was throwing the ball fine in the bullpen, and when I went in the game I don't know if it was a little adrenaline or something but I was leaving the ball up," deGrom said.	DeGrom gave up eight hits and a career high-tying six runs that more than tripled his ERA to 2.96.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: GM Sandy Alderson said closer Bobby Parnell (Tommy John surgery) is being shut down for a week because of forearm soreness. Alderson said team medical director Dr. David Altchek found nothing wrong with the right-hander's surgically repaired pitching elbow.	Yankees: Carlos Beltran turned 38 Friday. He went 0-for-3 to lower his average to .173 with no homers and seven RBIs after having elbow surgery in the offseason.	UP NEXT	Mets: Harvey Day hits the road. Ace Matt Harvey tries to improve to 4-0 in his return from Tommy John surgery. In nine career April starts, the Dark Knight is 7-0 with a 2.12 ERA.	Yankees: Coming off his best start of the year -- eight innings in a 2-1 loss at Detroit -- CC Sabathia is looking for his first win since April 24, 2014. The big left-hander had knee surgery that limited him to eight starts last year.	SEE YA	Jonathon Niese, the Mets' Sunday starter, was ejected in the sixth inning, shouting at plate umpire and crew chief Doug Eddings during Juan Lagares' at-bat. "I told him make an adjustment, and he said he didn't want to hear another word," Niese said, "and I said, 'Well, then, make an adjustment,' and then he tossed me."	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PHILADELPHIA --  The Phillies' struggling offense got just enough help from Atlanta to pull out a victory.	Freddie Freeman mishandled Ben Revere's ground ball to first, allowing Freddy Galvis to score in the ninth to give Philadelphia a 1-0 win on Friday night.	Galvis led off with a single to center against Jim Johnson (1-2), went to second on Cesar Hernandez's sacrifice bunt and third on a passed ball.	Revere chopped the ball toward first base and Galvis broke for home. Freeman had a play at the plate but he bobbled the ball.	"I just tried to have some speed and get to home plate as quickly as I can," Galvis said. "It worked good."	It was one of four errors for the Braves, who have lost four straight and eight of 11.	"I'm not so sure if Freeman comes up with it he scores (anyway)," Atlanta manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "But it doesn't sit right with four errors."	Ken Giles (1-0) pitched a scoreless ninth for the win.	Aaron Harang struck out six and walked one while allowing just two hits in eight shutout innings.	"He did everything he could to help himself tonight," manager Ryne Sandberg said.	The Braves got their only hits in the fifth inning when A.J. Pierzynski stayed hot with a one-out double followed by Chris Johnson's line-drive single. But that was all Atlanta could manage off Harang, who retired his final 10 batters.	"I was really on," Harang said. "I had to work to find out my limitations and try and find the limitations of the strike zone. Once I was able to establish that, I was good to go and everything kind of fell into place."	But Philadelphia's struggling offense couldn't get Harang the lead despite several chances. The Phillies entered the game last in the majors in both runs (41) and average (.213) and showed why on Friday.	"Overall, we had some hits up and down the lineup but weren't able to get the hit with a man on base like we'd like to," Sandberg said.	Revere grounded out with a man on second in the fifth, Carlos Ruiz popped out to left with the bases loaded in the sixth and Odubel Herrera grounded out with a man on second in the seventh.	Their best chance to score before the ninth came in the eighth with runners on first and third with one out. But Cody Asche, who entered batting a team-best .333, popped out to first after a surprising bunt attempt and Ruiz struck out.	Alex Wood didn't allow a run in 5 2/3 innings, giving up five hits while striking out one and walking two. Cody Martin and Luis Avilan combined for two scoreless innings of relief.	The Phillies played a flawless game in the field after committing five combined errors while getting outscored 15-2 in losses to Miami on Wednesday and Thursday.	The Braves were leading the majors in fielding percentage (.993) and entered with four errors on the season.	"We had too many miscues tonight," Freeman said.	BAD BUNT	Sandberg said he would've liked Asche to swing away in the eighth.	"He did that on his own," Sandberg said. "He had an idea there to lay down a bunt."	COLD NIGHT	It felt more like football season in Philadelphia with a game-time temperature of 55 degrees and a strong wind making it feel much colder.	"It's one of those things where you go all spring in warm weather and then all of the sudden it's cold and windy," Wood said.	He said he had a hard time gripping the ball because of the conditions, but "so did everybody else."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Braves: Andrelton Simmons took a hard bump from first baseman Ryan Howard at the bag while trying to beat out a double play in the fifth inning. After walking it off, Simmons stayed in the game.	Phillies: Closer Jonathan Papelbon wasn't with the team due to a sickness that kept him home in bed all day Friday, according to Sandberg.	UP NEXT	Braves: RHP Shelby Miller (2-0, 1.69) aims to continue his strong start when the Braves play the second of three games in Philadelphia at 7:05 Saturday night.	Phillies: RHP David Buchanan (0-3, 9.22 ERA) will look to get back into the form he displayed in spring training.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

DETROIT --  Left off the Cleveland Indians' roster at the end of spring training, Danny Salazar is trying to make the most of a second chance.	Thus far, he's doing a fine job.	Salazar struck out a career-high 11, Brandon Moss homered twice and drove in seven runs, and the Indians routed the suddenly slumping Detroit Tigers 13-1 Friday night.	Thanks to some help from center fielder Michael Bourn, Salazar (2-0) escaped a bases-loaded jam in the first and went on to pitch seven strong innings.	"This is what we've expected to see from Danny all along," Indians manager Terry Francona said. "He looks like a different pitcher than he did in Florida, and we're going to challenge him every day to keep that going."	Salazar gave up six hits and three walks.	"I'm challenging guys now, and tonight I was able to throw all my pitches when I needed them," he said. "That's the difference."	Salazar was handed a two-run lead in the first inning, thanks to Moss' two-run double, but the Tigers loaded the bases with two outs in the bottom half. Yoenis Cespedes launched a drive to deep right-center, but Bourn ran it down on the warning track.	"That's the play of the game right there," Francona said. "That's a grand slam in any other park other than maybe Houston, and if it gets down here, it is three runs. Instead, Michael gets us out of the inning, and Danny was great from there."	Detroit has lost four straight after an 11-2 start.	"I don't know if I would call anything a trend at this point," manager Brad Ausmus said. "We've had a lot of low-scoring games, and a few high-scoring games mixed in. Obviously, you're never happy with a game like this one."	Moss followed up his first-inning double with a three-run homer in the fifth and a two-run shot in the ninth. He came into the game hitting .162 with two RBIs in 12 games.	"We knew Brandon was going to break out, and that was going to mean some big production," Francona said. "When he gets going, he can carry a team."	Lonnie Chisenhall hit a two-run homer in the eighth for the Indians, who entered with 11 homers -- none with runners on base.	Shane Greene (3-1) had only allowed one earned run in 23 innings coming into the game, but gave up eight in four innings against Cleveland, starting with Moss' double in the first.	"I felt really good, but I left some balls up and paid for it," Greene said. "These are the best hitters in the world, and you have to make your pitches."	The Indians made it 3-0 in the second, but the Tigers got a run back on Nick Castellanos' homer in the bottom of the inning.	Cleveland broke the game open in the fifth with a little help from Detroit's defense. With two on and none out, Jason Kipnis bunted down the third-base line. The ball briefly rolled foul, but Castellanos picked it up just as it came back onto the line.	Michael Brantley followed with an RBI single, and Carlos Santana made it 6-1 with a double that sailed over the head of J.D. Martinez in right. Moss then hit Alex Wilson's first pitch for a three-run homer.	David Murphy doubled on Al Alburquerque's first pitch in the eighth, and Chisenhall followed with a homer to right. Moss hit his second homer of the night off Alburquerque in the ninth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: C Yan Gomes (knee) is expected to miss at least another month. He was injured on a slide by Detroit's Rajai Davis when the teams met earlier this month.	Detroit: Ausmus said RHP Justin Verlander remains in limbo. Verlander, who hasn't pitched this season due a triceps strain, hasn't thrown since a simulated game had to be cut short by fatigue and soreness last week.	HISTORY LESSON	It was the 114th anniversary of the first game in American League history, which saw the Chicago White Stockings beat the Cleveland Blues 8-2 in 90 minutes. Every other AL game that day was rained out.	UP NEXT	Indians: Trevor Bauer (2-0, 0.95 ERA) will start Saturday afternoon against the Tigers. Bauer, who has never lost to Detroit in five career starts, has not allowed a run in 13 innings on the road this season.	Tigers: Alfredo Simon (3-0, 1.74) will pitch in Saturday's Negro Leagues Tribute game. Simon is 2-2 with a 5.40 ERA in eight career appearances against the Indians, including three starts. Cleveland has scored more runs (20) against him than it has strikeouts (18).	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CINCINNATI --  The Chicago Cubs escaped a bases-loaded threat before taking full advantage of one of their own.	Jonathan Herrera singled home the tiebreaking run in the 11th inning, and David Ross followed with a bases-loaded double that sent the Cubs to a 7-3 victory over the Cincinnati Reds on Friday night.	After losing back-to-back games for the first time this season, Chicago pulled one out with a big rally against a struggling bullpen. It was Chicago's first extra-inning win on the road, leaving the Cubs 3-0 in extra innings overall.	"I've always thought really highly of a team that can win in extra innings on the road," manager Joe Maddon said. "That's always been my measuring stick of a good team.	"I'll take the attitude of these guys any day of the week."	Anthony Rizzo homered, doubled and started Chicago's winning rally with a single off Burke Badenhop (0-1) as the Reds' bullpen failed again. The Reds' bullpen has a 5.36 ERA, worst in the National League.	Herrera singled home the go-ahead run, and Ross doubled home two more. Starting pitcher Travis Wood drove in the final run with a pinch-hit grounder.	Jason Motte (1-0) got Jay Bruce to foul out with the bases loaded in the 10th inning, keeping it tied at 3. Hector Rondon retired the side in order in the 11th for his fourth save in five chances.	Cincinnati stranded eight runners and went 0 for 14 with runners in scoring position.	"We had opportunities to pull it out," Bruce said. "We just couldn't come through tonight. The writing was on the wall."	Jon Lester, the Cubs' biggest offseason acquisition, remained winless in four starts. He got a six-year, $155 million deal last December that included a $30 million signing bonus -- a record for a major leaguer.	Lester allowed three runs in six innings and fanned a season-high 10 batters. He has allowed at least three runs in each start. The left-hander couldn't slow down Billy Hamilton, who singled twice, stole three bases and scored a pair of runs.	Still, it was an improvement over the first three starts.	"I'm learning," said Lester, who had spent his whole career in the American League. "New league, new faces, new guys. I'm kind of figuring them out as we go."	Mike Leake gave up three runs in seven innings, striking out a season-high nine. Leake is 8-2 career against the Cubs and 5-0 in eight starts against them at Great American Ball Park.	Leake gave up Rizzo's two-run homer in the fourth and Chris Coghlan's solo shot in the seventh that tied it at 3. Coghlan is 9 for 11 career against Leake with three doubles and a pair of homers.	FLASHBACK	The Reds reunited most of their 1990 World Series championship team and wore replicas of their 1990 uniforms for the game.	REMEMBERING ERNIE	The Reds showed a photo of the late Ernie Banks on the videoboard and observed a moment of silence in his memory before the game. The Hall of Fame slugger, who spent his entire major league career with the Cubs, died on Jan. 23.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: Reliever Pedro Strop wasn't available because of a sore foot.	Reds: C Devin Mesoraco is still limited to a pinch-hit role because of a sore left hip. He hopes to try catching in the bullpen in the next few days. Mesoraco has been limited to two pinch-hit appearances in the last 11 games.	UP NEXT	Cubs: RHP Jake Arrieta (2-1) makes his second appearance against the Reds this season. He allowed three runs in six innings of a 3-2 loss at Wrigley Field on April 14.	Reds: RHP Anthony DeSclafani (2-0) hasn't given up a run in his last 15 innings, a career best. He makes his fourth start with the Reds, who got him from Miami in the trade for Mat Latos. He got the win in the 3-2 victory at Wrigley on April 14, throwing seven shutout innings.	---	Follow Joe Kay on Twitter: http://twitter.com/apjoekay	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

MIAMI --  Miami Marlins right-hander Mat Latos wasn't too concerned Friday night about getting his first win. He just wanted to pitch past the first inning.	Bouncing back from a dismal start in Miami earlier this season, Latos went 6 1/3 innings to help the revitalized Marlins beat the Washington Nationals 3-2.	Martin Prado broke a tie with an eighth-inning single, and Latos and three relievers combined on a six-hitter.	Latos didn't get the decision, but the outing was a big improvement over his other start this year at Marlins Park, when he lasted just two-thirds of an inning and gave up seven runs.	"Coming back here after that embarrassment, there was a lot of emotion running through that first inning," Latos said. " Every other inning seemed easier after that."	Like Latos, the Marlins are bouncing back. They won their third game in a row after a 3-11 start.	"We're playing better baseball," Prado said. "That's what everybody was expecting with this team."	The win came at the start of a nine-game homestand. The Nationals, beginning a 10-game trip, lost their third straight.	With the score 2-all, Adeiny Hechavarria doubled to start the eighth against Tanner Roark (0-2) and advanced on an infield single by Dee Gordon. Prado followed with a single off Aaron Barrett.	Prado also made a diving stop of a sharp grounder at third base to rob Yunel Escobar of a hit leading off the ninth.	Latos, acquired by Miami in the offseason, had his best outing yet. The tall right-hander allowed two runs to lower his ERA to 7.31.	"He was battling the whole time," Prado said. "To see him work so hard like that, it's contagious. That's what we're expecting from him."	Latos, a .118 career batter, also hit a two-out RBI single in the fifth for Miami's first run.	"Accidental," he said. "Swing hard in case you hit it."	Bryan Morris (2-0) pitched around two walks in a scoreless eighth. Steve Cishek followed with a perfect ninth for his first save. He had 39 last year.	Jordan Zimmermann, who no-hit the Marlins the last time he faced them on the final day of the 2014 regular season, allowed six hits and two runs in six innings.	Bryce Harper drove in Washington's runs with a sacrifice fly and a two-out single. But the Nationals went 1 for 7 with runners in scoring position.	Six of their 10 losses this season have been by one or two runs.	"It's not fun, especially in dogfights like that," Harper said. "Jordan threw such a great game, he should have been able to win that game. It's rough for us, but we'll keep plugging."	Washington took a 1-0 lead in the fourth when Ian Desmond doubled, went to third on a flyout and came home on Harper's sac fly. Harper hit an RBI single in the sixth to make it 2-all.	Miami scored twice in the fifth on four consecutive two-out singles, including RBI hits by Latos and Gordon.	JAPANESE RECORD	With a run in the fifth, the Marlins' Ichiro Suzuki has scored 1,967 runs in the major leagues (1,309) and Japan (658). That ties the record for the most runs by a Japanese player held by Sadaharu Oh, who scored all of his in Japan.	LOUD OUTS	Nationals left fielder Jayson Werth made an over-the-shoulder basket catch at the warning track to rob Latos of an extra-base hit in the third, and center fielder Denard Span did the same on Marcell Ozuna's 400-foot fly in the fifth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: RHP Max Scherzer is expected to make his next start as scheduled even though he jammed his pitching hand while batting Sunday. " His thumb is a little swollen," manager Matt Williams said. "All indications are that he should be all right. Needless to say, he won't be hitting in between starts."	Marlins: Backup catcher Jeff Mathis (broken right hand) is scheduled to get a follow-up X-ray next Friday.	UP NEXT	RHP Stephen Strasburg (1-1, 4.50 ERA) is scheduled to pitch Saturday for the Nationals against RHP Tom Koehler (1-2, 6.75). Strasburg is 3-4 with a 5.59 ERA in seven starts at Marlins Park.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  James Loney and Drew Smyly departed Tampa Bay's crowded disabled list and helped the Rays to a runaway win.	Loney, Rene Rivera and Tim Beckham each hit a two-run homer, and the Tampa Bay beat the Toronto Blue Jays 12-3 on Friday night.	Smyly came within one out of winning his first start of the season. The left-hander gave up two runs and four hits in 4 2/3 innings.	"That's baseball," said Smyly, who was hampered by tendinitis in spring training. "I had a pre-determined pitch count and it stinks that it landed with one out to go in the fifth."	Smyly's pitch count was 75. He finished with 79.	"Extremely unfortunate that his pitch count kind of got to the difficult decision-making zone, and that's on me that we had to prioritize his health over his record at this point," manager Kevin Cash said. "I apologize to him, but that's the plan we had in place and we wanted to stick to it."	Jose Dominguez (1-0) pitched 1 1/3 innings for his first major league win, and Matt Andriese pitched the final three innings for his first career save. The Rays optioned Dominguez to Triple-A Durham after the game.	The home runs by Loney and Rivera came in a four-run fourth inning off R.A. Dickey (0-2).	Returning from the DL after missing 15 games with a strained right oblique, Loney went deep for the first time since Sept. 9. He went 2 for 5 with a double and scored twice.	"It's fun being back out there again," he said after his first career stint on the disabled list. "I'm just glad it's over."	Rivera's homer was his first for the Rays.	Dickey allowed eight runs, seven earned, and nine hits in 4 2/3 innings. The knuckleballer walked one while throwing 86 pitches.	"I threw some really bad ones tonight that they hit," he said. "Sometimes those get popped up or not swung at. Sometimes it's great and sometimes you stink. Tonight it stunk."	Beckham hit his third homer of the season off Jeff Francis in the seventh.	Evan Longoria drove in his first run in 12 games with a sacrifice fly in Tampa Bay's five-run fifth. Kevin Kiermaier completed that outburst with a fly ball that went off the glove of left fielder Steve Tolleson for a four-base error.	Devon Travis' fifth home run was the first of four straight Toronto hits off Smyly in the fourth, giving the Blue Jays a 2-0 lead. They did not score again until Justin Smoak's home run in the ninth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: OF Jose Bautista missed a third straight game with a sore shoulder. Manager John Gibbons said Bautista will not go on the disabled list and is likely to DH a game or two before turning to the outfield.	Rays: RHP Alex Cobb said he felt great after throwing 22 fastballs in his first bullpen session since being sidelined during spring training by forearm tendinitis. ... Closer Jake McGee (back stiffness) is scheduled to throw off a mound Saturday.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays: OF Michael Saunders, who has yet to play after injuring his knee in spring training, was activated from the 15-day disabled list after the game. Tolleson was designated for assignment.	Rays: RF Steven Souza Jr. will be back in the starting lineup Saturday night after being rested Friday, which was his 26th birthday.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

MILWAUKEE --  Carlos Martinez likes pitching in Miller Park, and it shows.	Martinez struck out eight in seven innings, Jason Heyward and Jhonny Peralta homered, and the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Milwaukee Brewers 3-0 Friday night.	"I feel good in this stadium," the 23-year-old Martinez said through a translator. "I like the mound."	Martinez (2-0) gave up four hits and walked two in the longest of his 11 career starts. The right-hander has a 2.04 ERA in eight road games against the Brewers, with 19 strikeouts in 17 2/3 innings.	"I don't know what it is about Milwaukee, but he's bouncing and jumping all over the place. He was a little higher energy than we've seen," Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said. "He had a very live fastball today and I thought he used his other stuff effectively, but his fastball was the story."	Martinez has won each of his last two starts while lowering his ERA to 1.35 for the season.	"He's attacking the hitters, putting them away with that slider, with that changeup," catcher Yadier Molina said.	Jordan Walden pitched the eighth and Trevor Rosenthal finished for his seventh save in seven tries, completing a five-hitter.	Heyward belted a solo shot off Matt Garza in the third, lifting St. Louis to a 2-0 lead. Peralta homered leading off the sixth.	Garza (1-3) allowed seven hits in six innings while striking out a season-high six.	Milwaukee has dropped nine of 10. At 3-14, the Brewers have the worst record in the majors.	The Brewers threatened in the third, but were hurt by poor baserunning.	Garza led off with his fourth career walk and advanced to second on Jean Segura's single. As Gerardo Parra squared to bunt, Garza broke for third. Initially ruled safe, Garza was called out after a review. Parra then struck out and Segura was caught stealing.	Molina's run-scoring groundout got St. Louis on the board in the second, but the six-time All-Star left in the fifth in what the team said was a precautionary move. Molina was in pain after a foul tip struck him in the knee guard in the fourth. He is day to day.	Molina took a foul ball off the same knee last week.	"I was feeling better and boom, tonight I get hit again in the same spot," he said. "He got me on the muscle. It's just a big bruise."	CAUGHT STEALING	Entering Friday night's game, Molina, known for his strong arm, had only thrown out one attempted base stealer. Then he cut down two baserunners in in the third inning.	"I was excited. It's been a while," Molina said. "I feel good to get the outs."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: OF Peter Bourjos returned after being on paternity leave for three days. His wife, Ashley, gave birth to a son, Maxton. Infielder Dean Anna was optioned to Triple-A Memphis to clear a roster spot for Bourjos.	Brewers: OF Carlos Gomez continues to make progress in recovering from a right hamstring injury. He is on the 15-day disabled list. "He's hitting again out on the field. He ran on the treadmill," manager Ron Roenicke said. "Hopefully, it'll be those 15 days or just a couple added onto that."	UP NEXT	Cardinals: Adam Wainwright (2-1, 1.71 ERA) took the loss against the Brewers in St. Louis' home opener on April 13. He is 12-8 with a 2.37 ERA in 31 career games versus the Brewers.	Brewers: Wily Peralta (0-2, 5.68 ERA) will make his second start of the season against St. Louis. He is 4-5 with a 4.58 ERA in 10 career starts against the Cardinals, but went 3-1 with a 2.18 ERA in five starts against them last season.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DENVER --  Nolan Arenado dived to his right to snare a grounder and start a double play. Later, he ranged far to his left to field a bouncer that appeared destined for the outfield.	Just another routine day at the hot corner for Colorado's Gold Glover.	Pinch-hitter Rafael Ynoa snapped a sixth-inning tie with an RBI double, Eddie Butler was buoyed by the stellar defense of Arenado & Co. over six shaky innings and the Rockies beat the San Francisco Giants 6-4 on Friday night.	"That game could've went different directions four or five different times and our defense was a big reason why we kept it on our side," manager Walt Weiss said.	Arenado has such a knack for making the difficult plays look downright routine that Weiss recently said he's reinventing the position.	"I just try to do my job," Arenado said with a casual shrug. "I have my own style. I try to make plays."	Butler (2-1) labored most of the way with only one clean inning. He allowed four runs, but worked his way out of trouble thanks to some nifty fielding, especially from Arenado and centerfielder Charlie Blackmon.	"It's the best defense," Butler said. "Unbelievable."	Blackmon added a solo homer and DJ LeMahieu drove in two runs as Colorado beat the defending World Series champions for a fourth straight time this season. The Rockies swept a three-game series last week in which they limited the Giants to three runs. San Francisco matched that total by the third inning Friday.	Chris Heston (2-2) gave up six runs over 5 1/3 innings in his first appearance at Coors Field, raising his ERA from 0.87 to 2.77. Heston had yielded two earned runs in his past three starts.	"He'll learn from this," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "Overall, he did all right."	Ynoa gave the Rockies a 5-4 lead when he hit a double to left that brought home LeMahieu, who had tied the game with a double earlier in the inning. Corey Dickerson added an RBI single.	Colorado's bullpen made the lead hold up -- with some anxious moments. Boone Logan struck out Brandon Crawford looking to end the eighth with a runner on third. Bochy argued the call and was ejected after a few words with plate umpire John Tumpane.	"It's a big at-bat," Bochy explained. "We're trying to get back in the game."	Arenado had quite a game in the field, moving far to his left to lasso a chopper in the seventh, spinning around and throwing out Gregor Blanco.	In the fourth, Arenado dived to his right to stop a grounder with runners on first and second and no outs. He scrambled to his feet, stepped on third base and fired to first to get Casey McGehee by a step.	"It seems like almost nightly, (Arenado) does something to change the game defensively," Weiss said.	Not to be outdone, Blackmon made quite a play to end the third inning when he caught a ball in right-center, turned and threw a strike to first base that doubled up Angel Pagan, who figured the ball was headed for the gap.	MAXWELL'S NIGHT	Justin Maxwell hit a two-run homer for San Francisco in the second and later made a "circus catch" near the wall in right.	"Normally, that ball would have been right at me, but since we were playing in outer space the ball kept carrying a little bit," Maxwell said. "I'm just fortunate I have long arms."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Giants: OF Hunter Pence (broken left arm) hit off a tee in the cage before the game. "Was it 100 percent? No, but he was swinging," Bochy said. ... RHP Jake Peavy (strained back) played catch. Bochy said there's no schedule for when Peavy will throw off a mound.	Rockies: SS Troy Tulowitzki understands why Weiss kept him out even if he loathes days off. "They want to keep me healthy for the long haul," said Tulowitzki, who popped out as a pinch-hitter in the seventh.	UP NEXT	Giants: RHP Tim Hudson (0-2, 3.93 ERA) seeks his first career win at Coors Field. He's 0-2 with a 7.29 ERA in eight starts in the Mile High City.	Rockies: LHP Jorge De La Rosa (0-1, 31.50) looks to get back on track in his second start of the season. He's 6-1 with a 3.43 ERA in 10 starts against the Giants at Coors Field.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PHOENIX --  Gerrit Cole is on a roll that goes all the way back to early September.	The right-hander pitched into the eighth inning for his third win this season, and Josh Harrison and Neil Walker each drove in two runs to lead the Pittsburgh Pirates over the Arizona Diamondbacks 4-1 Friday night.	Cole (3-0) allowed one run and seven hits in 7 2/3 innings and was hitting the high 90s (mph) on the radar gun even toward the end of his outing. He struck out seven and walked two, improving to 7-0 since Sept. 7 last season.	"I just kept a good delivery throughout the game and tried to stay in a good rhythm," Cole said. "Just kept trying to stay aggressive."	Cole also helped his own cause with a hit and a run scored. Asked after the game if he recalled the last time he lost, he said he couldn't.	"It's nice to put a couple on the board, however many it may be," Cole said. "It gives you a little bit of confidence to attack in the zone."	Harrison lined a two-out double to right-center in the second inning, driving in Jordy Mercer and Cole to give the Pirates a 3-0 lead. Pittsburgh scored all its runs with two outs.	"I feel my eyes get big every time I'm in the batter's box," Harrison said. "We know we can get things done with two outs."	Diamondbacks starter Josh Collmenter (1-3) lasted six innings, yielding three runs and six hits while striking out three.	Walker's RBI single in the first gave him a seven-game hitting streak, the longest for any Pirates player this season. Walker also doubled in Andrew McCutchen from first base in the eighth.	Paul Goldschmidt beat Walker's throw home from second base on an infield hit by Chris Owings with two outs in the sixth for the Diamondbacks' only run.	"He was throwing a lot of first-pitch strikes and guys were behind in the count," Goldschmidt said of Cole.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  While trotting around the bases on his go-ahead homer, David Freese was as pumped up for teammate Garrett Richards as he was for himself.	Richards pitched seven effective innings for his first win since injuring his knee last year, but he wouldn't have won if not for Freese's clutch drive against rookie Keone Kela in the seventh inning of the Los Angeles Angels' 3-2 victory over the Texas Rangers on Friday night.	"It was nice to get the lead for G.Richards while he was technically available to get the `W.' That was huge," Freese said. "I was fired up, thinking about trying to get that `W' for him. As hitters, we think about the pitchers who are out there busting their tails when they're not getting enough runs."	Kole Calhoun greeted Kela (0-1) with a leadoff single and was erased on a fielder's choice grounder by Mike Trout, who stole second and was nearly doubled off the bag after Kela caught Albert Pujols' liner and tried to complete what would have been an inning-ending double play. Freeze then drove a 3-2 pitch to left-center for his fourth homer.	"You just look for something you can handle and be patient," Freese said. "I was ready the first pitch, and then he threw that curveball in on 3-1, and I was kind of thinking that he might throw it on 3-2, just to get back on track. But he threw me a little sinker."	Richards (1-1) allowed two runs and three hits, struck out five and walked three in his fifth straight win over the Rangers. The victory was the right-hander's first since Aug. 15 last season, when he beat the Rangers 5-4 in Texas. He sustained a season-ending knee injury five days later while covering first base at Boston.	Joe Smith pitched a perfect eighth and Huston Street worked a hitless ninth for his sixth save. Street walked two, but ended the game by retiring Elvis Andrus on a grounder with runners at the corners.	Wandy Rodriguez allowed a run and five hits over five innings and struck out five in his American League debut after his contract was purchased from Triple-A Round Rock. It was the 36-year-old lefty's first appearance and start in the majors since May 21, 2014, with Pittsburgh.	"It was a veteran outing by a guy that hadn't been on a major league mound in more than nine months," Rangers manager Jeff Banister said. "Wandy gave us five innings and pitched through traffic for most of the night, but he moved the fastball around and competed very well. He pitched on the corners, used his breaking ball when he needed to and kept some pretty good hitters off balance."	Right-hander Logan Verrett was designated for assignment to make room for Rodriguez, released by Atlanta at the end of spring training.	Richards walked the Rangers' eighth and ninth hitters, Jake Smolinski and Carlos Corporan, to open the third inning and both scored after Leonys Martin advanced the runners with a sacrifice bunt. Mitch Moreland delivered the first run with a groundout, and Prince Fielder singled off Richards' glove to bring home the other.	The Angels got on the board in the fourth with Chris Iannetta's sacrifice fly. They nearly tied it in the fifth, but center fielder Martin raced toward the warning track and made a leaping catch to rob Pujols of extra bases with the speedy Trout at first base.	HAMILTON HUB-BUB	Most of the pregame chatter in both clubhouses revolved around reports that troubled outfielder Josh Hamilton is expected to be traded from the Angels to the Rangers in the next few days. During the two seasons that Hamilton and 3B Adrian Beltre were Rangers teammates (2011-12), Hamilton had 68 homers, 222 RBIs and a .291 average while Beltre batted .310 with 68 homers and 207 RBIs.	"If it does happen and he becomes a teammate, we're going to support him no matter what," said Beltre, who joined the Rangers the year after Hamilton was the AL MVP. "We'll do our best to help him think about baseball and not be a distraction. We know Josh and who he is. We hope he's healthy, his mind is in a good position, and he has the support he needs to be the productive Josh that we all know he can be -- the Josh that helped us go to the World Series in 2011. Who doesn't need a guy like Josh Hamilton? There might be a little more media craziness or more questions about why he's here, but we'll deal with it."	UP NEXT	Rangers: RHP Colby Lewis will be starting on six days' rest for the second straight time, after losing 3-1 to Seattle's Felix Hernandez last Saturday. Lewis was 1-4 with a 9.35 ERA against the Angels last season.	Angels: LHP C.J. Wilson was pushed back two days because of elbow stiffness. He allowed eight runs in 12 1/3 innings over his last two starts -- losses to Kansas City and Houston -- after pitching eight innings of two-hit ball in his season debut at Seattle. Wilson spent his first seven big league seasons with the Rangers.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  The Houston Astros aren't shy about celebrating their quick start, even if the season is less than a month old.	Pulling out an extra-inning win against a division rival after blowing a two-run lead certainly made them feel good. For a team that's had trouble getting going in April, it could mean even more.	Robbie Grossman singled home two runs in the 11th inning, and the Astros beat the Oakland Athletics 5-4 on Friday night to match their best start in eight years.	"The way we started the last couple of years was horrible, so anything better than that is going to give us confidence," Houston starter Dallas Keuchel said. "This win is extra rewarding, but at the same time every win is crucial. You take it when you can get it."	Keuchel pitched nine scoreless innings but was in the clubhouse when Grossman delivered the go-ahead hit.	Chris Carter and Colby Rasmus drew walks from Eric O'Flaherty (0-2) to begin Houston's rally. After Hank Conger's sacrifice moved the runners up, Grossman lined a 3-0 pitch to left.	Grossman had gone hitless in his previous four at-bats and was in an 0-for-9 funk before his clutch hit.	Jose Altuve added an RBI single, and that proved to be the difference after the A's scored twice in the bottom half against Pat Neshek.	"We had that game won twice and we didn't finish (it) until the very end," Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. "One of the things I've learned is that we compete, we play, until the end. We compete for 27 outs. Tonight it was more."	Luke Gregerson (1-0) got the win despite giving up two runs in the 10th. Chad Qualls retired one batter with two runners on for his second save.	The Astros improved to 9-7, equaling their best start since 2007.	Marcus Semien hit a two-run homer for Oakland, which has dropped four of six.	"It went from a starting pitching duel to a slugfest late in the game," A's manager Bob Melvin said. "We got down and then we came back. You have to look at the positives in it. We continued to fight."	Houston grabbed a 2-0 lead in the 10th on Marwin Gonzalez's two-run double with two outs.	Oakland tied it when pinch-hitter Josh Reddick doubled in two runs off Gregerson with two outs.	The late scoring was in stark contrast to the pitching duel between Keuchel and Scott Kazmir.	Keuchel pitched nine innings of two-hit ball. He struck out four and walked two.	Kazmir, who beat the Astros 11 days earlier, almost matched Keuchel. He gave up five hits and walked three with a season-high seven strikeouts in seven innings.	Altuve singled three times to extend his hitting streak against the A's to 27 games. It's the longest hitting streak by any Houston player against one team.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: RHP Josh Fields was activated from the disabled list, though the move had been announced earlier this week. ... Because Houston won't get another off day until May 11, Hinch said the team will continue to carry 13 pitchers. ... OF Jake Marisnick was kept out of the starting lineup because of leg soreness he had while running from first to third against Seattle on Wednesday.	Athletics: Oakland closer Sean Doolittle threw 15 pitches on flat ground and hopes to increase to 20 on Sunday. He is working his way back from a slight rotator cuff tear in his left shoulder. ... OF Coco Crisp (elbow) took dry swings and played catch but there is still no timetable for his return. ... RHP Jarrod Parker gave up three earned runs in 3 2/3 innings for Class A Stockton on Thursday. Parker, on the mend from elbow surgery, will make another rehab start Tuesday.	UP NEXT	Astros: RHP Scott Feldman (1-2) is the first Houston pitcher since 2008 to go at least five innings and allow one walk or fewer in his first three starts of a season.	Athletics: RHP Kendall Graveman (1-1) has made it out of the fourth inning only once this year -- when he went 5 1/3 innings to beat the Astros on April 14.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SEATTLE --  There was an extra twinge of disappointment for Felix Hernandez as he watched Trevor Plouffe's line drive fall into the grass of right field for a base hit.	With how well he was pitching, Seattle's ace knew there was the chance at something special Friday night.	"I had the stuff to throw a perfect game," Hernandez said. "But it didn't happen."	Hernandez settled for a five-hitter and his first complete game victory since August 2012, as the Mariners beat the Minnesota Twins 2-0.	Nelson Cruz gave Hernandez all the offense he needed with a major-league-leading ninth home run. Cruz's shot off Minnesota starter Phil Hughes (0-4) traveled 459 feet, according to date from Major League Baseball, into the second deck above the bullpens in left field.	But while Cruz provided a jolt, it was Hernandez that was dominant. He retired the first 14 batters before Plouffe's single with two outs in the fifth. He struck out nine, threw 102 pitches and got out of jams in the sixth and seventh innings.	It was Hernandez's first complete game win since beating Minnesota on Aug. 27, 2012, when he also allowed five hits. Hernandez is now 3-0 for the second straight season and the third time in his career.	"It's been a while so it feels really good," Hernandez said.	Hernandez was outstanding from the start, with a breaking ball that had more snap than any other time this season and a fastball he was able to spot around the strike zone.	Hernandez needed just 38 pitches to cruise through the first 12 batters, half striking out. He struck out Brian Dozier to start the fifth and got Kennys Vargas to ground out before Plouffe got the Twins' first hit on a 1-1 pitch.	An inning later, Hernandez found himself in a major jam. Kurt Suzuki reached on an infield single deep in the hole at short and advanced to second when Brad Miller's throw went out of play. Jordan Schafer -- robbed of a hit in the third on a great defensive play by Robinson Cano and Morrison -- reached on an infield single, putting runners at the corners with no outs.	Danny Santana hit a fly ball to center field but wasn't deep enough for Suzuki to tag and score. Torii Hunter struck out and Joe Mauer grounded out to first to end the threat.	Minnesota put runners at the corners with two outs in the seventh, but Hernandez got a fly out from Suzuki to end the inning.	"Just a great job of commanding the zone, commanding the tempo, keeping guys off balance just enough to make all of his stuff work," Seattle manager Lloyd McClendon said.	Hernandez was at 91 pitches after the eighth and came back for the ninth to a standing ovation. He got Mauer to ground out, Dozier to fly out and Vargas on a comebacker to close out the victory.	"He can throw any pitch in any count wherever he wants and they are all plus pitches," Schafer said. "Thank God every guy you face isn't like that."	MORRISON'S IMPACT	Logan Morrison added his first home run of the season -- his first extra-base hit and first RBI of the season as well -- with a solo shot to right-center field leading off the fifth.	Morrison had not gotten much luck early in the season at the plate.	"I was more of like `finally it went over the fence," Morrison said. "I didn't feel like I was due. You don't think about that as a player."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Twins: RHP Ricky Nolasco's scheduled rehab start at Single-A Cedar Rapids was pushed back from Saturday to Sunday. He's missed 12 games with right elbow inflammation.	Mariners: RHP Hisashi Iwakuma was placed on the 15-day DL with a right lat strain before Friday's game. Iwakuma had been feeling fatigue since his previous start on Monday against Houston and didn't feel any better after a bullpen session on Friday.	UP NEXT	Twins: Trevor May (1-1) will make his third start after picking up his first win of the season last time out. It'll be a special start for the Kelso, Washington native, his first at Safeco Field as a professional. He pitched at Safeco in a high school playoff game.	Mariners: LHP James Paxton starts for Seattle looking to rebound after lasting just 2 2/3 innings and giving up seven earned runs in his last start.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN DIEGO --  Zack Greinke watched second baseman Howie Kendrick glove Wil Myers' line drive to end the second inning with the bases loaded, and then hopped off the mound in joy.	While it was a rare show of emotion, Greinke did what he does best -- beat NL West foes.	Greinke held the San Diego Padres to four hits in seven innings, and Carl Crawford homered to help the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 3-0 victory Friday night.	"We needed that from Zack," manager Don Mattingly said. "We were hoping to get seven from him. It came at the right time. It gave a couple guys days off out there."	Greinke (3-0) improved to 21-1 with a 1.88 ERA in 31 games against division opponents since joining the Dodgers as a free agent before the 2013 season. He is 15-0 in his last 19 starts against NL West teams.	The right-hander is 5-0 with a 1.58 ERA in nine career starts against San Diego.	Greinke loaded the bases with no outs in the second by walking Yonder Alonso and allowing singles to Derek Norris and Will Middlebrooks. Greinke promptly got out of the jam by striking out Alexi Amarista and pitcher Andrew Cashner, and getting Myers to line out to Kendrick.	"I just remember being so happy Howie was positioned there," Greinke said. "I thought it was going to be through."	Mattingly couldn't recall Greinke showing such emotion.	"He hasn't really shown a lot of emotion. He just grows by leaps and bounds as we move into the season," Mattingly said.	Greinke allowed only a single and two walks the rest of the way. He struck out seven and walked three.	The Padres had runners on first and second with two outs in the fourth before Greinke got Cashner to pop up to second.	"He did a great job," Dodgers catcher Yasmani Grandal said. "One thing I told him right before the game was, `You execute and we're going to win this game.' Sure enough he did."	Greinke "threw the ball well," Myers said. "I feel like he got out of some situations that we should have capitalized on. I mean, my ball, line drive up the middle, what else can you do? The guy is standing behind second base. It should have been two runs right there, but that's the way the game goes."	Los Angeles rookie Yimi Garcia pitched the ninth for his first major league save.	The Dodgers snapped a three-game losing streak while San Diego lost its third straight.  The Padres, who came in tied for the second-most runs in the majors, have gone 14 straight innings without scoring.	Crawford homered deep into the seats in right off Cashner leading off the seventh, his first, to give the Dodgers a 2-0 lead. Joc Pederson hit a sacrifice fly in the ninth.	The Dodgers took a 1-0 lead in the second when Juan Uribe singled in Grandal, aboard on a one-out double. Grandal, acquired from San Diego in the Matt Kemp trade, paused and watched his drive as if he thought he homered. The ball landed in the left-field corner just in front of the fence.	Cashner (1-3) allowed two runs and six hits in seven innings, struck out six and walked one.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: RF Yasiel Puig came up limping after running out a grounder in the sixth inning and left with what the team said was a re-aggravated left hamstring. He was replaced by Andre Ethier. In the second, Puig was hit on the left knee by a pitch from Cashner.	Padres: RHP Shawn Kelley was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a strained left calf, retroactive to Thursday. RHP Kevin Quackenbush was recalled from Triple-A El Paso to take his roster spot.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: Brandon McCarthy (2-0, 4.50 ERA) goes into Saturday with a 5-1 record and 2.96 ERA in seven career starts against San Diego.	Padres: RHP Ian Kennedy will be activated from the 15-day disabled to start against the Dodgers. He's been out since straining his left hamstring during the home opener on April 9 against San Francisco.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DETROIT --  Miguel Cabrera didn't even have to swing the bat to hurt the Cleveland Indians this time.	Victor Martinez drove in three runs, taking advantage after Cleveland pitched around Cabrera, helping Alfredo Simon and the Detroit Tigers beat the Indians 4-1 Saturday.	Cabrera drew four walks in a game for the first time in his career, three of them intentional. Earlier this season, the two-time AL MVP went 11 for 14 with six RBIs in a three-game series at Cleveland.	"He's an unusual hitter," Indians manager Terry Francona said.	With Cabrera batting third, Martinez was in position to do damage hitting cleanup.	And he did.	Martinez hit a two-run single in the first, after Cabrera's non-intentional walk. He added an RBI single in the third after Cabrera's first intentional pass.	"Yeah, the two singles right-handed were obviously big, big runs to get us on the board early," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said about the switch-hitting Martinez.	"He took some pretty good swings left-handed, too. He squared up on the ball. He's not having a lot of luck left-handed when he is squaring up the ball, but I do see progress from him in terms of how his knee is feeling."	Martinez had knee surgery just before spring training.	Neither Martinez nor Cabrera spoke to the media after the game.	Simon (4-0) gave up one run and six hits in 6 2/3 innings.	"Today was very heavy on the splitter, for sure," Tigers catcher Alex Avila said about Simon. "He made some good pitches on the inside corner with his two-seam fastball."	Said center fielder Rajai Davis: It's really nice to go out and have our starting pitcher go deep into the game and throw a lot of strikes and we play good defense behind him."	Tom Gorzelanny got Brandon Moss to ground into a double play with two on to end the eighth. Joakim Soria pitched a perfect ninth for his sixth save.	Ian Kinsler drove in the other run for the Tigers, who had five stolen bases, three by Davis.	Michael Brantley had four hits, including a pair of doubles, and drove in Cleveland's run.	T.J. House (0-3) gave up three runs on four hits and four walks in three innings. He started in place of Trevor Bauer, who was scratched because of an illness.	"Probably not the flu. Probably food poisoning. He ate something last night that didn't go down well," Francona said. "He came to the park today and we tried to get some fluids in him. We put T.J. on notice that he might have to pitch. He warmed up and still didn't feel good."	Kinsler doubled home a run in the fourth. Brantley's RBI single came in the third.	Tigers shortstop Jose Iglesias made a spectacular diving catch toward the hole on a liner by pinch hitter Mike Aviles with a runner on first with no outs in the seventh.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: OF Nick Swisher was scheduled to be off on Saturday in his rehab assignment with Triple-A Columbus from bilateral knee surgery. He played all nine innings Friday night and was 3 for 5. He is scheduled to play all nine innings in RF on Sunday.	UP NEXT	Indians RHP Carlos Carrasco (2-1, 2.38) is scheduled to start against Tigers LHP Kyle Lobstein (1-1, 3.27) on Sunday in the wrapup of the three-game series. Carrasco is 2-5 with a 6.86 ERA in 13 games against Detroit in his career.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

NEW YORK -- Matt Harvey held the baseball in his right hand, pointed to his chest and said "Come on, let me get this guy," as his manager made a reluctant walk to the mound with two outs in the ninth inning.	Terry Collins' ace had done his job. Now the skipper had to do his.	Harvey was lifted one out shy of a complete game, earning his first win against the team he grew up rooting for, and led the New York Mets to an 8-2 victory Saturday over the crosstown-rival Yankees.	"I know he wants this game bad enough. He deserved it in every way," Collins said. "This was his day and he needed to be out there, so I did the best I could to leave him out there."	Kevin Plawecki hit his first major league homer and drove in three runs, and Lucas Duda and Eric Campbell also connected off an ineffective CC Sabathia (0-4).	Harvey (4-0) and the Mets rebounded from having their 11-game winning streak snapped in the Subway Series opener and kept pace with the 1986 World Series champions for the best start in franchise history at 14-4.	Juan Lagares went 4-for-4 with an RBI triple for the Mets, who got six of their seven RBIs from the Nos. 6-9 batters.	In the first Harvey Day at Yankee Stadium, the young ace from Connecticut didn't disappoint. Coming off Tommy John surgery, he received a nice ovation from Mets fans when he took the mound for the ninth.	With two outs, Harvey gave up just his fifth hit and second walk to push his pitch count to 107. Collins was willing to let Harvey go a little longer because he knew Rafael Montero is scheduled to make a spot start Tuesday, giving the Mets' rotation an extra day of rest.	Harvey wasn't even watching the pitch count. He knew he was efficient enough to go deep and went straight to Collins after the eighth.	"I still felt good. I still felt strong," Harvey said. "Once you get that close to it you want to finish, but I think he made the right call."	The Mets needed to wait an extra 1 minute, 4 seconds to celebrate their 12th win in 13 games as the Yankees challenged a close play at second for the final out.	Harvey struck out seven and yielded Mark Teixeira's third homer of the series, a leadoff drive in the seventh.	The buzzing crowd of 47,909 stirred for The Dark Knight's first time facing baseball's favorite villain: Harvey struck out Alex Rodriguez with an 89 mph curveball after A-Rod fouled off a 97 mph fastball. The right-hander struck out Rodriguez with heat in the ninth.	"That's what baseball's all about," Rodriguez said. "He challenged me with a 98 mph fastball and threw it right by me."	Pitching with his balky left ankle taped, Harvey looked nimble fielding his position. He bounded off the mound and made a barehanded grab of a bouncer toward third base by Brian McCann in the second, then fielded Rodriguez's sharp shot up the middle with an acrobatic shuffle to end the third.	The Yankees jumped out early Friday night in the opener of a much-anticipated series between first-place Big Apple clubs for a 6-1 win. In this late-afternoon start, the Mets broke things open after the shadows passed the pitcher's mound in the fourth inning to snap the Yankees' four-game winning streak.	Duda lined a flat breaking pitch with two outs from Sabathia just over the wall in right field to open the scoring in the first.	Jacoby Ellsbury tied it in the third on a double-play grounder.	The Mets got the lead right back against a fading Sabathia, scoring four times with two outs in the fourth, including Plawecki's homer.	"It was a special day in many ways," Plawecki said.	Sabathia was lifted to boos after Campbell homered and Lagares singled to start the sixth. The big lefty, coming off an encouraging start in Detroit, allowed seven runs and nine hits in five-plus innings.	"I was getting ahead but just not with quality pitches," Sabathia said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: Relief pitcher Vic Black wrote on his blog that doctors have figured out that what was thought to be shoulder weakness is actually nerve irritation caused by a herniated disk in his neck. Black has been shut down for several days in his rehab.	Yankees: Ellsbury, who made a sliding catch in left-center in the fourth, was lifted to start the eighth with a tight hip.	UP NEXT	Mets: LHP Jonathon Niese is on a career-best run of allowing two runs or less for seven straight starts dating to last season. In his previous start, Niese allowed a run in 6⅔ innings to improve to 2-0 with a 1.50 ERA this year.	Yankees: RHP Nathan Eovaldi is coming off his first win with the Yankees, giving up one run and eight hits in seven innings against Detroit.	MILESTONE?	The Yankees customarily provide media with a sheet of their players' upcoming milestones. With Rodriguez two homers from tying Willie Mays for fourth on the career homer list with 660, New York was giving out a list on the road without Rodriguez's total. On the first two games of this homestand there has been no sheet at all.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  The pitching has been stellar, the lineup much deeper and the progress the Houston Astros showed in spring training has carried over to the opening month of the season.	Jose Altuve hit a three-run homer and extended his hitting streak against Oakland to 28 games, helping the surging Astros beat the Athletics 9-3 on Saturday.	"It was obvious we were going to play really good," Altuve said. "That's what we're doing right now. Everybody is supporting each other. We're hitting, we're pitching. We're a really good team right now."	After losing more games than any other team the past six years, Houston has won four of six series to open the season and stands in first place in the AL West.	Jed Lowrie drove in two runs and George Springer homered for the Astros (10-7), who have won six of seven and are off to their best start since winning 12 of 17 games to open the 2006 season.	"I don't have a sense of that where we get too high, we get too low," manager A.J. Hinch said. "We have a huge expectation to do well and play clean baseball. I don't think guys are looking too much into it because there are areas that we can do a lot better."	Scott Feldman (2-2) allowed three runs and five hits in 6 2/3 innings to get the win.	Oakland's Kendall Graveman (1-2) allowed six runs in 4 2/3 innings. It was the third time in four starts that he failed to complete five innings.	The A's (8-11) have lost three straight to fall three games under .500 for the first time since July 2012.	"We're not playing very well here in the last five games or so," manager Bob Melvin said. "Even before that, we'd lose some close games but we were getting consistent at-bats, we were getting on-base, we were swinging the bats well. At this point, we're not doing anything too terribly right."	Altuve led off the game with a single, taking little time to tie David Segui for the second-longest hitting streak ever against the A's, according to information provided by the Astros from the Elias Sports Bureau. Luke Appling had a 31-game streak in 1939-40.	"It's nothing extra special against the A's because he hits against everybody, but certainly that's a long time to play against one opponent and continue to have success," Hinch said.	Altuve then was caught stealing on a pickoff throw from Graveman, but the Astros still got a run in the inning on Lowrie's RBI double that Sam Fuld dropped after a long run to the warning track in center field.	Altuve delivered again his second time up, belting his second homer of the season to make it 4-0 in the second.	Lowrie added an RBI single off Graveman in the fifth and then scored on reliever Chris Bassitt's wild pitch.	It only got uglier from there for the A's. Right fielder Josh Reddick and left fielder Cody Ross each dropped fly balls for errors in the seventh, leading to two more Houston runs.	Eric Sogard hit a two-run triple in a three-run seventh for Oakland.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: OF Jake Marisnick sat for a second straight for the second straight day with a sore right leg.	Athletics: Infielder/outfielder Ben Zobrist went on the 15-day DL with torn cartilage in his left knee, and INF Max Muncy was promoted from Triple-A Nashville. Zobrist will need arthroscopic surgery and likely be sidelined for four to six weeks.	BOUNCE BACK	Feldman has 10 quality starts in his past 11 outings dating to last year, with the only hiccup coming in an 8-1 loss to the A's earlier this month. He allowed eight runs -- seven earned -- and 10 hits in five innings on April 13 before holding Oakland scoreless until the seventh in the rematch.	"I just kind of looked at what went wrong last time and tried to make an adjustment of what I could do better," he said.	UP NEXT	Astros: Asher Wojciechowski (0-1) will start the series finale as the Astros try to complete their first series sweep ever against the A's.	Athletics: Drew Pomeranz (1-2) will look for his first win against Houston. Pomeranz is 0-2 with a 6.28 ERA in four career appearances, including three starts, against the Astros.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

MIAMI --  Tom Koehler outpitched Stephen Strasburg, Ichiro Suzuki overtook Sadaharu Oh, and the revitalized Miami Marlins beat the slumping Washington Nationals.	Koehler went 7 1/3 innings and Suzuki broke a Japanese record for runs to help the Marlins earn their fourth win in a row Saturday, 8-0.	Giancarlo Stanton homered for the Marlins, whose winning streak follows a 3-11 start.	"The mood changes when you win," manager Mike Redmond said. "Nobody's happy about losing."	Defending NL East champion Washington endured its fourth consecutive defeat and fell into a tie for third place with Miami.	"It will turn. It always does," Nationals outfielder Jayson Werth said. "We just have to stay positive. It's too early to get frustrated."	Suzuki had two hits and scored in the eighth for his 1,968th run in the major leagues (1,310) and Japan (658), surpassing Oh's record for a Japanese player.	"When it's Mr. Oh's record, it's very special," Suzuki said through a translator.	Stanton had three hits, including his fifth homer in the past nine games, and drove in two runs. Justin Bour, recalled Friday from Triple-A, had a pair of RBI singles, and Adeiny Hechavarria hit a three-run homer.	Strasburg (1-2) allowed eight hits and four runs in six innings. His frustration showed in the dugout, where he had an animated conversation with pitching coach Steve McCatty after allowing two runs in the fourth.	"That's something that's going to be kept between me and Cat," Strasburg said. "Obviously, I'm a competitive person. It's nothing that he did; it's nothing that I did. It was just maybe a little bit of frustration. I'm going to leave it at that."	Opponents are batting .317 against Strasburg, and his ERA rose to 4.88. He has a 5.65 ERA in eight career starts at Marlins Park.	Koehler (2-2) gave up six hits in 7 1/3 innings. He lowered his ERA from 6.75 to 4.50, and two relievers completed Miami's first shutout of the year.	Bryce Harper went 0 for 3 and is 2 for 15 lifetime against Koehler.	"It was a rough day for us," manager Matt Williams said.	Strasburg had shut out the Marlins for 17 consecutive innings dating to last July before they broke through with two runs in the fourth.	Martin Prado and Stanton hit back-to-back doubles. Bour singled for his first hit and RBI of the season.	Miami added two more in the sixth on an RBI single by Bour and a run-scoring double play grounder. The Marlins went 5 for 8 with runners in scoring position.	SUZUKI'S CONTRIBUTION	Suzuki received a big ovation from the crowd and a jubilant greeting from his teammates when he scored the record-breaking run on Hechavarria's homer.	"What I'm happiest about is you have fans and teammates who acknowledge it, and might even know more than I know about my own records,"  Suzuki said.	The 41-year-old outfielder hiked his average to .286 and has played in every game.	"This guy has been fun to have around," Redmond said. "He's special. He has been around a long time and accomplished so much. He's going to be a big part of our team, and you've seen that already."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: RHP Max Scherzer's right thumb was still swollen, and the Nationals pushed back his scheduled bullpen session one day to Sunday. The Nationals are hoping he can make his next start as scheduled Tuesday at Atlanta. He jammed his hand while batting Thursday.	Marlins: An MRI determined that LF Christian Yelich has a slight disc bulge in his lower back. Rest and exercise are expected to resolve the problem, and Yelich said he's optimistic he'll able to come off the disabled list when eligible May 5. "It's feeling better every day, and that's encouraging," he said. ... RHP Jose Fernandez is scheduled to throw 15 pitches Thursday in his first batting practice session since undergoing reconstructive elbow surgery. ... RHP Henderson Alvarez (shoulder and elbow) is scheduled to throw a bullpen session the middle of next week, his first since going on the disabled list April 17.	UP NEXT	Washington LHP Gio Gonzalez (1-1, 3.44), a South Florida native, has won five consecutive starts against the Marlins and faces them Sunday. RHP Dan Haren (1-1, 3.32) is scheduled to pitch for the Marlins as they go for a sweep.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Tim Beckham wanted one more chance after a tough night at the plate, and the Tampa Bay Rays are happy he got it.	The rookie hit a tiebreaking double during a three-run eighth inning and the Rays won their fourth straight game by beating the Toronto Blue Jays 4-2 on Saturday.	"I struck out twice tonight looking," Beckham said. "I wasn't too happy about that. I just wanted to get another AB and another opportunity to hit the ball hard."	James Loney got the Rays even at 2 with a pinch-hit RBI double before Beckham's hit off Miguel Castro gave Tampa Bay a 4-2 advantage.	"You always want to be part of it," said Loney, who homered in his return from an oblique injury in Friday night's 12-3 win over Toronto. "We just want to keep it going."	Ernesto Frieri (1-1) struck out all three batters he faced for the win. Brad Boxberger pitched the ninth for his fifth save.	Brett Cecil (1-2) faced one batter, giving up a two-out single to David DeJesus, who entered on defense in the top of the eighth when center fielder Desmond Jennings exited with left knee soreness.	The Blue Jays have dropped two of the first three games in the series, and have won just one of their last 23 series at Tropicana Field.	"What are you going to do?" Toronto manager John Gibbons said. "It's on the schedule, you've got to play here. Play better."	Toronto rookie Daniel Norris allowed one run and five hits in seven innings on his 22nd birthday. The lefty struck out seven and walked three.	Russell Martin opened the seventh with an opposite-field homer to right off Steve Geltz that put the Blue Jays up 2-1.	Martin and outfielders Michael Saunders and Dalton Pompey were in the Toronto lineup, marking the first time in major league history that three Canadian position players started in the same game.	Blue Jays rookie Devon Travis went 2 for 4, extending his hitting streak to 11 games. He doubled in the first and scored on Josh Donaldson's single.	Tampa Bay tied it at 1 later in the first when Evan Longoria got the first of his four hits, a pop-fly double down the right-field line.	"There are guys top to bottom in the lineup coming through with big hits," Longoria said. "Really just never giving up."	The four hits by Longoria tied his career high.	Erasmo Ramirez, who entered with a 21.32 ERA in three games, gave up one run and four hits over four innings for Tampa Bay.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: OF Jose Bautista (shoulder) missed his fourth straight game and is day to day.	Rays: Jennings is day to day. ... Tampa Bay closer Jake McGee (back) threw a 21-pitch bullpen session and might pitch Tuesday for Class A Charlotte.	MOVING DAY	Tampa Bay purchased the contract of LHP Everett Teaford from Triple-A Durham and designated 1B Allan Dykstra for assignment.	ILLEGAL TOUCHING?	Gibbons talked with the umpires following Beckham's hit after he was told by someone in the dugout that Rays third base coach Charlie Montoyo may have touched one of the baserunners.	"You're not allowed to do that," Gibbons said. "But you can't review that."	UP NEXT	Tampa Bay RHP Chris Archer (2-2) expects no carry-over Sunday when he faces the Blue Jays for the first time since April 16, when Longoria was hit by a pitch one inning after Archer plunked Edwin Encarnacion.

BALTIMORE -- Minutes after watching a thrilling baseball game that featured one surprising play after another, thousands of fans at Camden Yards had no idea what to expect after emerging from the safety of the ballpark.	"Oh, calm. Good," Ali Howard said at the exit, around 15 minutes after the Orioles beat the Boston Red Sox 5-4 in 10 innings Saturday night to end a five-game losing streak.	A crowd of 36,757 showed up for this matchup of AL East foes. Outside the stadium, thousands gathered to protest the death of Freddie Gray, who died in police custody after suffering an unexplained spinal injury.	Several helicopters circled Camden Yards as some of the protesters threw cans and plastic bottles in the direction of police officers.	In the middle of the ninth inning, after the Red Sox extended a game the Orioles seemingly had in hand, the public address announcer told the fans that the mayor and city officials requested no one leave the ballpark because of "ongoing public safety issues."	By the bottom of the 10th, the restriction on departing the stadium had been lifted. But fans were warned against traveling in certain parts of the city.	"We took our sweet time coming out," Howard said. "This is by far the most insane thing I've ever been through."	As a slight rain began to fall, Baltimore blew a 3-2 lead in the ninth inning. The Orioles then fell behind in the 10th before rallying in the bottom half.	It was a tough loss for the Red Sox, who had no idea how they were going to weave through the demonstrators back to the team hotel.	"I'm sure there's a route that we will take that will be different from what we've done in the past, which would go right through where the protest is taking place currently," manager John Farrell said. "I don't know what route that's going to be right now."	Meanwhile, Courtney Mish of Baltimore was poised to walk home from the stadium with a few of her friends. They didn't get to their seats until the second inning because they watched the demonstration from home.	"I'm not that concerned," Mish said.	What about that announcement instructing the fans to stay in the ballpark?	"Fine," Mish said. "We wanted to see the end of the game, anyway."	Baltimore trailed 4-3 in the bottom of the 10th when Adam Jones got a triple off Koji Uehara (1-1) on a liner that right fielder Allen Craig lost in the lights. After Chris Davis followed with a sacrifice fly, David Lough stepped to the plate.	Lough, who entered as a pinch runner in the eighth, smacked a 3-2 pitch to right. As the ball soared toward its destination over the wall, Lough thrust his left arm into the air to celebrate the first game-ending home run of his career.	That made up for the ninth inning, when Baltimore closer Zach Britton failed to secure a victory for Wei-Yin Chen. After Boston loaded the bases with one out, Pablo Sandoval hit a sharp grounder to third that Manny Machado picked up before tagging the base. His throw to first base went awry, allowing the tying run to score.	Xander Bogaerts homered in the top of the 10th off Brad Brach before Brian Matusz (1-2) finished.	Jimmy Paredes had four hits and a homer for the Orioles, whose losing streak was their longest since September 2013. Paredes' long ball off Justin Masterson put Baltimore up 3-2 in the fifth.	Chen gave up two runs, four hits and a walk over eight innings. The left-hander retired the final 12 batters he faced after Hanley Ramirez got thrown out at the plate to end the fourth.	Orioles manager Buck Showalter missed the start of the game to attend his father-in-law's funeral in Tennessee. Bench coach John Russell took over the team, but Showalter assumed his familiar spot in the dugout in the third inning.	"(Russell) was telling me they were listening to what was going on in the clubhouse before the game," Showalter said. "These guys are aware of what's going on. I'm sure we'll have people talk about spending the night here. There are so many things that can take your attention away from a baseball game, rightfully so. As important as we think this is, there are some things that are more important."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: OF Shane Victorino was placed on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to Thursday, with a strained right hamstring. RHP Matt Barnes was recalled from Triple-A Pawtucket.	Orioles: Russell said shortstop J.J. Hardy (shoulder) has been taking batting practice and "is making very good progress" in his effort to return.	UP NEXT	Red Sox: LHP Wade Miley (1-1, 6.08 ERA) makes his fourth start with Boston on Sunday in the series finale.	Orioles: Bud Norris (0-2, 17.42 ERA) takes another shot at his first win of the season.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PHILADELPHIA --  Andrelton Simmons ended Atlanta's scoreless drought with one big swing.	With new life late in the game, the Braves' losing streak was soon behind them, too.	Simmons led off the seventh inning with a homer, sparking a rally that helped Atlanta beat the Philadelphia Phillies 5-2 on Saturday night.	The Braves scored three runs in the seventh and chased David Buchanan (0-4) while stopping a four-game slide. Chris Johnson had an RBI single and Eric Young Jr. delivered a go-ahead double that lifted Atlanta to a 3-2 lead.	The Braves added two more in the eighth while rebounding from a 1-0 loss in the series opener Friday night.	"No runs last night, none through six tonight, you might see some hanging heads there," Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "But they stayed in there and battled."	Jason Grilli, one of three Atlanta relievers, worked a scoreless ninth for his seventh save.	Shelby Miller (3-0) allowed two runs and three hits over six innings in his third straight win.	"I felt strong and could have gone longer, but we needed runs," he said.	Ryan Howard hit a two-run homer for the Phillies.	Miller had his fourth steady outing of the season, always keeping the Braves in the game even without flashy numbers. He hasn't pitched more than six innings in a game and hasn't allowed more than two runs.	His lone slip came in the fourth when Howard's second homer of the season landed in the shrubs beyond the center-field fence. Howard, batting .180 entering the game, hit his third career homer off Miller.	Miller and Buchanan were locked in a breezy duel in a game that needed about an hour to play five innings. Buchanan had a six-pitch first inning and needed only 25 to get through three.	Buchanan was helped in the sixth by shortstop Freddy Galvis' diving stop-and-tumble to nip Nick Markakis at first. Galvis snared the ball that was headed to center, rolled and threw a one-hopper from his stomach for the out. He needed help off the field but stayed in the game.	"That was one of the better plays I've ever seen," Phillies manager Ryne Sandberg said. "How he got a throw off, I have no idea."	Simmons got the Braves rolling with his first homer of the season. With two outs in the seventh, Buchanan walked two and Jake Diekman allowed Johnson's RBI single and Young followed with a double.	Buchanan, who has not won in his last 13 starts, retired his first 12 batters and was cruising before the rocky seventh.	"What happened there, it was just unacceptable," he said. "I've got to figure out what it was that you walk two guys after throwing strikes that much. That was inexcusable."	Trailing 3-2, Phillies catcher Carlos Ruiz was thrown out by left fielder Johnny Gomes while trying for a double. The call stood after a brief replay review.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Braves: Atlanta's defense is suddenly hurting. The Braves made four errors on Friday night and another one on Saturday.	Phillies: Closer Jonathan Papelbon was available to pitch, though he suffered earlier in the day from a migraine. ...  RHP Chad Billingsley made his third rehab start on Saturday night. Billingsley, who is trying to recover from two right elbow surgeries that limited him to 12 innings the last two seasons, allowed seven runs in five innings for Triple-A Lehigh Valley. He was expected to make at least one more start in the minors.	UP NEXT	Braves: RHP Trevor Cahill (0-2, 9.95 ERA) has pitched only 6 1/3 innings total this season in two starts. His lone career win against the Phillies came in relief in 2013. Cahill is 3-14 the last two seasons.	Phillies: RHP Jerome Williams (1-1, 3.71 ERA) goes for his second straight win. He allowed three runs in six innings in his last start against Miami.	HAPPY BIRTHDAY	The Phillies Phanatic continued to look like he hasn't aged a day 37 years after his April 25, 1978 debut. The Phillies will throw the Phanatic (now played by Tom Burgoyne) a birthday party Sunday with surprise guests from the Galapagos Islands, a cake, and fans will lead a "Happy Birthday" singalong.	STARTER NAMED	Sandberg said RHP Severino Gonzalez will get the start and make his major league debut Tuesday against St. Louis.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MILWAUKEE --  Adam Wainwright's ankle injury put a damper on Mitch Harris' major league debut for St. Louis and took most of the luster off the Cardinals' 5-3 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers on Saturday night.	Wainwright was helped from the field by a trainer after injuring his left ankle while stumbling out of the batter's box on his popup to first leading off the fifth inning. He allowed three hits in four shutout innings.	"It's something in the back of my ankle so we'll see what it is on Monday," said Wainwright, who was wearing a walking boot after the game. "Everything right now is just all speculation."	Wainwright will be re-evaluated when the Cardinals return to St. Louis. The Cardinals complete a six-game trip with a Sunday afternoon game at Miller Park.	"It was by far the best I felt this year," Wainwright said. "I really had things working. I started changing arm angles a little bit, working in and out better than I have been and I just was having a lot of fun out there. It reminded me of last year a lot.	"Those strides I was talking about making over the course of the year, I started to make them today. That's the hardest part just knowing I was making such good adjustments, and now I've got a setback."	Harris then tossed 1 1/3 scoreless innings in his first big league game at the age of 29 after serving five years of active duty in the U.S. Navy following his graduation from the Naval Academy.	"It's one of those bittersweet ... the last thing I want to see happen to Adam, but I was happy to finally get in there," said Harris, who struck out the first batter he faced.	Matt Holliday hit a three-run drive in the seventh for St. Louis, which has won four in a row. It was Holliday's first homer of the season.	The Brewers lost for the 10th time in 11 games to fall to 3-15. Every other team in the majors has at least six victories.	Milwaukee scored three runs with two outs in the eighth on an RBI single by Adam Lind and a bases-loaded double by Aramis Ramirez, but Hector Gomez bounced out to third to strand the tying runs.	Matt Belisle (1-0) got five outs for the win and Seth Maness pitched 1 1/3 innings for his first save.	Holliday's 26th career homer against the Brewers put the Cardinals up 5-0. Matt Carpenter, who extended his hitting streak to 12 games with a fifth-inning single, doubled with one out in the seventh and Jason Heyward drew a walk.	Brewers manager Ron Roenicke was ejected by plate umpire Dale Scott during the pitching change to Jeremy Jeffress, whose first pitch was hammered over the wall in right-center by Holliday.	"I didn't like his strike zone, so I told him he had a bad night," Roenicke said. "They're calling what they see. Some nights it works out against you and unfortunately, with us, it seems like it's been against us. But we're not playing good baseball and it happens all the way around, where you don't get calls, you don't get breaks, and that's what we're going through."	St. Louis grabbed a 2-0 lead in the second when Kolten Wong had an RBI triple and came home on a wild relay throw to third by shortstop Jean Segura.	Milwaukee right-hander Wily Peralta (0-3) allowed seven hits in six innings in his third consecutive loss. He struck out four and walked two.	UP NEXT	Cardinals: RHP Lance Lynn (1-1, 1.56 ERA) has allowed one earned run in each of his three starts this season. He is 6-2 in his career against the Brewers, including 4-1 with a 1.85 ERA in six starts at Miller Park.	Brewers: Mike Fiers, who gave up two grand slams in his last outing, has yet to make a quality start in three outings. Fiers, who hit Marlins slugger Giancarlo Stanton in the face last September, is 0-3 this season with a 6.75 ERA and opponents are batting .333 against him.	TRAINER'S ROOM:	Cardinals: C Yadier Molina, forced out of Friday's 3-0 win over the Brewers after being struck on the right knee guard by a foul tip, was out of the lineup. Tony Cruz started in place of Molina. "We're still hopeful that we're talking a day or so. We'll adjust as we need to," manager Mike Matheny said.	Brewers: With starters Carlos Gomez (CF), Jonathan Lucroy (C) and Scooter Gennett (2B) all on the disabled list, Roenicke has been forced to mix-and-match, using 16 different lineups through the first 17 games. "I guess what it tells you is that, if you're changing all the time, something's not working," Roenicke said.	UPON FURTHER REVIEW	The Brewers successfully challenged a call at first base in the sixth inning, negating what would have been the Cardinals' fourth double play. Pinch-hitter Elian Herrera opened with a walk and Jean Segura followed with a bouncer to second. Segura was originally called out on the end of 4-6-3 double play, but the call was overturned after a review estimated at 49 seconds.	Milwaukee also made another challenge on the final out of the game. After an estimated review of 24 seconds, the ruling that Segura was out at first was confirmed. It was the first challenge the Brewers have lost this season after winning the first four.

DENVER --  The game between the San Francisco Giants and Colorado Rockies has been rained out.	A makeup date has yet to be announced. The Giants return to Denver in late May for a three-game series.	Sunday's matchup was scrubbed about two hours before the scheduled start. Right-hander Tim Lincecum (1-1) had been set to take the mound for San Francisco against lefty Tyler Matzek (1-0) of Colorado.	The rainout came on the 20th anniversary of opening day at Coors Field on April 26, 1995. Colorado brought in several former players for the occasion, including Larry Walker.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

PHOENIX --  By getting important contributions from just about everyone on the team, the Pittsburgh Pirates have put together their best April winning streak in seven years.	Neil Walker doubled with two outs in the ninth inning and scored on Starling Marte's single, sending the Pirates to a 2-1 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Saturday night.	"I was just trying to find a way to get on base any way I can," Walker said. "We don't have just one or two guys that can beat you. We have seven or eight guys that can on any given night, and we do what we can to win."	The Pirates have won four straight in April for the first time since 2008.	"It's another thing we had on our to-do list coming in," manager Clint Hurdle said. "We're working hard to get better every single day collectively as a club."	Tony Watson (1-1) pitched out of trouble in the eighth to earn the win. Mark Melancon worked the ninth for his fifth save.	Addison Reed (0-1) took the loss for the Diamondbacks, who have dropped three of four.	Watson gave up consecutive singles to start the eighth and Paul Goldschmidt followed with a soft bouncer to third for the first out, advancing the runners. But pinch-hitter Mark Trumbo fouled out and Watson whiffed Aaron Hill to escape the jam.	"He's cool out there," Hurdle said. "He's got a slow heartbeat. He doesn't get rattled."	Each team's starter dominated over the first seven innings.	Pittsburgh right-hander A.J. Burnett scattered five hits, walked two and struck out four. Burnett has allowed one run in each of his past three starts and five earned runs total over 25 innings for a 1.80 ERA.	"It's different now than it was a couple of years ago with velocity and stuff," Burnett said. "I just pitch and not get stubborn thinking I can sneak some balls by the hitters. Sometimes I can, sometimes I can set that up. But just pitch and use the movement to my advantage."	On the other side, Rubby De La Rosa yielded four hits and matched a career high with eight strikeouts. The right-hander did not walk a batter.	"I tried to attack the zone," De La Rosa said. "Everything I did tonight, everything was under control."	The Diamondbacks took a 1-0 lead in the second with a two-out rally. Chris Owings singled, stole second and scored on a single by Tuffy Gosewisch.	Cliff Pennington bunted toward third base against an exaggerated shift to the right side for an easy single, but Burnett struck out De La Rosa to end the inning.	Pittsburgh tied it in the fourth. Walker doubled to right field and came home one out later when Pedro Alvarez doubled into the right-field corner.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: INF Justin Sellers, who began the season on the disabled list with pain in his left heel, will begin a rehab assignment at Triple-A Indianapolis this weekend.	Diamondbacks: RHP David Hernandez threw a scoreless inning and struck out one in an extended spring training game against the Brewers. LHP Patrick Corbin threw a bullpen session Friday at Chase Field. Both pitchers are working their way back from Tommy John surgery.	CHASING KOUFAX	With his four strikeouts, Burnett moved closer to Dodgers Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax on the career list. Burnett is six strikeouts behind Koufax for 42nd place and needs 10 more to become the 41st pitcher with 2,400. Burnett is second in strikeouts to Yankees LHP CC Sabathia among active players.	EARLY CHALLENGE	Arizona manager Chip Hale exhausted a replay challenge with two outs in the first inning when he disputed Gregory Polanco's steal of second base. Umpires needed nearly four minutes to rule on the challenge before upholding Phil Cuzzi's call at second base. Two pitches later, De La Rosa retired Walker to strand Polanco at second.	STREAKING NO MORE	Pirates 3B Josh Harrison had hit safely in his past six games at Chase Field, going 11 for 27 for a healthy .407 batting average during that stretch. But he was hitless in four at-bats, including a pair of strikeouts.	RELIEF RECORD	Diamondbacks reliever Brad Ziegler pitched a scoreless eighth inning to set a club record with 254 career appearances. Ziegler appeared in 223 games with Oakland before being shipped to Arizona at the 2011 trade deadline for two players.	UP NEXT	Pirates: LHP Francisco Liriano (0-1) makes his fourth start of the season Sunday. Liriano has started twice previously against Arizona, once last season for Pittsburgh and once for the Minnesota Twins.	Diamondbacks: RHP Jeremy Hellickson (1-2) is coming off his first win for Arizona last Sunday against San Francisco. Hellickson has yet to face Pittsburgh but has held a trio of Pirates batters -- Corey Hart, Francisco Cervelli and Chris Stewart -- hitless in seven at-bats.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN DIEGO --  Petco Park played like a bandbox with the wind blowing out Saturday night, and Adrian Gonzalez and the Los Angeles Dodgers capitalized.	Gonzalez hit his sixth home run against San Diego this year, a three-run shot, and Andre Ethier, Howie Kendrick and Juan Uribe each had a two-run drive to give the Dodgers an 11-8 victory over the Padres.	"The universe was a little off track there for the first inning and a half," Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said. "And then it kind of got whacked out again."	The Dodgers got a scare when starter Brandon McCarthy came out with tightness in his right elbow after allowing a three-run homer to Justin Upton in the sixth. Upton also hit a two-run shot in the first.	McCarthy said he'd been working through the tightness for the last week and it flared up in the second inning.	"I kept getting quick outs so it was kind of making it hard. It was hurting but you're getting the outs so let's keep going and save the bullpen. Unfortunately, it cost us a bunch of runs," he said.	McCarthy is scheduled to have an MRI exam Monday.	"I think he's experienced enough to know that if he thought it was something really bad he would have shut himself down earlier," Mattingly said. "He just felt like he could keep going and all of a sudden he couldn't."	Gonzalez leads the NL with seven homers and 18 RBIs.	The NL West-leading Dodgers had scored nine runs combined in their previous four games. They've won four of five against the new-look Padres.	Wil Myers hit his first career leadoff homer for San Diego.	The teams combined to hit seven homers, five doubles and one triple on a chilly, windy and damp night at Petco Park.	Gonzalez played with the Padres from 2006 until being traded to Boston after the 2010 season. He hit five homers against them in a season-opening, three-game series at Dodger Stadium, including three off Andrew Cashner on April 8.	The slugger's drive landed in the home run porch in the right-field corner to give the Dodgers a 6-3 lead with two outs in the second.	Gonzalez is 13 for 22 (.591) with 10 RBIs in five games against San Diego this season. In his last 11 games against the Padres, he's 22 for 49 (.449) with eight homers and 13 RBIs.	Ethier homered deep into the seats down the right-field line in the first, his second, and Kendrick hit an impressive shot to straightaway center, his third, to chase Ian Kennedy in the fifth. Uribe hit an opposite-field shot into the right-field porch off rookie Chris Rearick with two outs in the fifth. It was his first and it gave the Dodgers a 10-3 lead.	"We were able to get some balls to fall today," Kendrick said. "The ones out of the yard, you can't predict that stuff. You just put the bat on it. You get the ball flying like that out of here in a park that's normally not a home run-type park. It was just an uncharacteristic day for this park, but we'll take it."	The Padres pulled to 10-7 in the sixth. Upton hit a three-run homer into the sandy play area beyond the fence in right-center to chase McCarthy. Sergio Santos came on and allowed Yonder Alonso's triple and Derek Norris' RBI groundout.	Upton hit a two-run homer in the first, an opposite-field shot that just went over a leaping Ethier and landed on top of the right-field wall. It tied the game at 3.	"I've never seen the ball flying out of here like it was tonight," Upton said. "The ball was carrying to right-center and to right field, so like you saw there was an elevated number of runs."	McCarthy (3-0) allowed six runs and six hits in five-plus innings, struck out four and walked one. He had retired 12 straight batters before allowing three straight hits to open the sixth, including Upton's three-run homer.	Kennedy (0-1) was activated from the 15-day disabled list earlier Saturday. He strained his left hamstring against San Francisco during the home opener on April 9. He allowed eight hits and eight runs in 4 1/3 innings, struck out two and walked one.	San Diego has lost four straight overall, including two to the Dodgers. This is the Padres' first series loss at home since the All-Star break last year. They had been 11-0-1 since then in series at Petco Park.	San Diego's Matt Kemp was ejected for arguing with umpire Marty Foster after taking a called third strike to end the seventh.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: RF Yasiel Puig missed the game with a strained left hamstring, and Mattingly said Puig could be a candidate for the disabled list. Ethier started in his place.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: RHP Scott Baker is being summoned from Triple-A Oklahoma City to start Sunday's series finale.	Padres: RHP Brandon Morrow (0-0, 3.15 ERA) is scheduled to make his fourth start for the Padres.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  A few minutes after Kole Calhoun got thrown out at the plate in the sixth inning, the same thing happened to Erick Aybar.	Wasting baserunners usually would be a major problem for the Los Angeles Angels, who haven't exactly been battering the ball this season.	This time, that sixth inning was still big enough to keep their winning streak going.	C.J. Cron hit a tiebreaking, two-run single in the sixth, leading the Angels to their third straight victory, 4-1 over the Texas Rangers on Saturday night.	Albert Pujols tied it with a bases-loaded single for the Angels, who scored three runs in the sixth despite having two runners thrown out at the plate.	"It's how we play," Cron said. "We're an aggressive ballclub, and we're going to run the bases. Fortunately, the offense put up enough runs this time."	Mike Trout singled, reached base three times and scored the tiebreaking run after the Angels honored him in a pregame ceremony for winning last season's AL MVP award.	Pujols also drew a bases-loaded walk in the seventh as Los Angeles climbed back to .500. Calhoun had three hits, and Grant Green went 2 for 3 and scored two runs in his season debut at second base.	Those balanced contributions are what manager Mike Scioscia wants every night.	"We need to get deeper," Scioscia said. "We have to keep that going. We'll feel better when we get some guys swinging the bats, but we're getting some wins, and hopefully we'll keep it going. We don't want to rely on our pitchers this much."	C.J. Wilson yielded seven hits and three walks during 5 2/3 innings for the Angels, but Texas pushed across just one run on his wild pitch in the fourth.	After his start was pushed back two days by pain in his left elbow, Wilson found trouble in every inning against his former team, but kept Texas off the scoreboard until the fourth when Adrian Beltre hit a leadoff single and eventually scored. The Rangers stranded eight runners put on base against Wilson, who felt good about his resilience.	"Mike knows I'm a really competitive guy and I want to pitch, even if I don't have my best stuff," Wilson said. "I'm going to go out there and try to compete."	Los Angeles' bullpen was rock-solid again, with five relievers throwing 3 1/3 innings of one-hit ball. Vinny Pestano (1-0) escaped a bases-loaded jam created by Wilson in the sixth, getting Robinson Chirinos on a groundout. Huston Street then saved his third consecutive game for the Angels, his seventh in seven chances this season.	Colby Lewis (1-2) didn't allow a runner to reach second base until the sixth, when he was abruptly chased with the bases loaded. Texas reliever Roman Mendez allowed three runs to score, and the Rangers lost for the fifth time in six games.	"I'm frustrated with myself," Lewis said. "When you're in close ballgames like that, I feel like your pitch count just goes up because you're always worried about the next pitch. You end up throwing more pitches than you're used to throwing, so it doesn't allow you to let up on any pitches, because every pitch matters."	HAMILTON'S MOVE	The AL West rivals played the middle game of their series while wrapping up a deal to send $125 million Angels slugger Josh Hamilton back to Texas, according to multiple media reports. The troubled 2010 AL MVP could be a boost to the Rangers' struggling lineup, while Los Angeles is still unable to find production in left field after Hamilton's two poor seasons and Matt Joyce's rough start to his first season with the Angels. Joyce went 0 for 3 with a walk, dropping his average to .132.	IT NEVER RAINS?	Batting practice was canceled when an unexpected storm dropped rain all over the Southland, forcing the teams to hit indoors. Any weather delay is a rarity in sunny Southern California, but the game went on as planned with a game-time temperature of 63 degrees. Wilson wore sleeves. "The wind was blowing, so the two-seamer was dipping," he said with a smile. "The sleeves were a power move on my part."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: Wilson got roughly two hours of treatment each day on his elbow, and he'll get an extra day off before his next start due to the Angels' off day on Monday.	UP NEXT	Rangers: Nick Martinez (2-0, 0.45) brings his microscopic ERA into his fourth start of 2015.	Angels: Hector Santiago (2-1, 2.45) goes after his third straight victory.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

SEATTLE --  Minnesota pitcher Trevor May could not avoid a line drive but it could have been worse.	May exited in the fourth inning Saturday night when Seattle third baseman Kyle Seager's liner smacked him on the right elbow. The diagnosis is a bruise and X-rays were negative. He is day to day.	"You never want to leave a game before the fifth because it really taxes your bullpen," May said.	But sevens were lucky for the Twins, who collectively rallied to beat the Mariners 8-5.	Seven players drove in a run. Seven players scored a run and it took seven pitchers to hold off the Mariners. Tim Stauffer (1-0) earned the win and Glen Perkins picked up his fourth save in four chances.	"There were a lot of contributions," Twins manager Paul Molitor said. "We talked about it, if we're going to be effective offensively it's going to have to be balanced."	Eduardo Escobar hit a home run. Eduardo Nunez had two hits and two RBIs and the Twins took advantage of three Mariners errors and two wild pitches.	Austin Jackson had a two-run home run for the Mariners in the seventh, his second.	"We shot ourselves in the foot quite a bit tonight," Mariners manager Lloyd McClendon said. "Our philosophy around here is real simple -- nine innings, 27 outs. We didn't do that tonight."	May said the he "absolutely" expects to make his next start. Much will depend on if the swelling goes down and how it feels Sunday.	"I fully expect to be right on track," May said. "It's something we'll address tomorrow. But there's no stiffness, no pain, just a little tender on the spot."	After the Twins capitalized on two first-inning Mariner errors for a 1-0 lead, Nelson Cruz drove in a pair on a double down the right-field line.	That gave Cruz a league-leading 20 RBIs. It's the most by a Mariners player in April since 2003, when Bret Boone had 21. The club record is 30 by Ken Griffey Jr., in 1997. There are still five games remaining in the month.	Another error in the fifth -- the second by Seager -- set up the Twins' go-ahead rally, as Nunez and Kurt Suzuki hit successive RBI singles for a 4-3 lead.	It was a hard-luck outing for James Paxton (0-2). Three of his four runs allowed in 4 2/3 innings were unearned. He gave up five hits, struck out seven and walked three.	Robinson Cano had two hits to extend his hitting streak to 11 games. He's hitting .409 (18 of 44) during that span.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: RHP Hisashi Iwakuma, placed on the DL Friday, had a second more detailed MRI before the game to determine the extent of a strained muscle under his right arm. He'll be out two to four weeks.	Twins: Ricky Nolasco (right elbow inflammation), who has been on the DL since April 11 and missed 15 games, will have his first rehab assignment Sunday for Class A Cedar Rapids.	UP NEXT	Mariners: LHP Roenis Elias has yet to be added to the roster, but it's no secret that he will be promoted from Triple-A Tacoma to start Sunday. He was in the clubhouse before the game. He fills the rotation spot for Iwakuma. Elias, one of the final cuts in training camp, was 10-12 with a 3.85 ERA last season.	Twins: RHP Kyle Gibson (1-2, 5.87) makes his fourth start of the season Sunday, coming off a 7-1 loss to Kansas City Monday. He gave up four runs, four hits and walked four in five innings. He is 2-1 with a 3.00 ERA in four career starts against Seattle.	MAY CONTINGENT BUMMED	May being removed after being hit with the line drive was a disappointment to a large, enthusiastic contingent behind home plate, said to be around 100, from May's hometown of Kelso, Washington.	BOOTS AND BOBBLES	The three errors committed by the Mariners give them 19 this season. That ties them with Milwaukee for second most in baseball, one behind Oakland, which has 20.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO --  The Chicago White Sox and Kansas City Royals lost two games because of rain Saturday -- the completion of a suspended game and Saturday's regular game.	A makeup date for Saturday's originally scheduled game has not been determined. The teams will resume their suspended game at 1:10 p.m. Sunday, followed by their regular game.	The Royals and White Sox were tied at 2 on Friday when the game was suspended because of rain entering the ninth inning. The game was called after a 40-minute delay. It will be resumed with the Royals batting in the top of the ninth.	David Robertson was warming up and had been announced to pitch for the White Sox in the suspended game. Chris Young was pitching for the Royals. John Danks (0-2, 6.06 ERA) is to start for the White Sox in the second game Sunday, with Edinson Volquez (2-1, 1.99 ERA) expected to go for the Royals.	Though no makeup date has been announced for Saturday's game, the Royals return to Chicago after the All-Star break on July 17-19 and Sept. 29-Oct. 1.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

DETROIT --  Miguel Cabrera is continuing his hot start against the Cleveland Indians in April.	Cabrera homered and drove in three runs and the Detroit Tigers beat the Indians 8-6 on Sunday.	Cabrera has three homers this season, all against Cleveland, and nine of his 13 RBIs this season are against the Indians. He is batting .377 for the season.	"I know they don't like facing him," Tigers starter Kyle Lobstein said. "They walk him a lot, and that means the rest of our guys get to see better pitches. That helps everyone."	Lobstein (2-1) picked up the win, allowing three runs and six hits in seven innings. He walked two and struck out four and kept the Indians from scoring more than one run in any inning.	"The last time I faced these guys, I didn't have fastball command," he said. "It felt better today, and I think I was able to keep them off balance with it."	Joakim Soria pitched the ninth for his seventh save. Soria allowed a leadoff homer to David Murphy, but finished the inning without further damage.	Soria got some help from Tigers shortstop Jose Iglesias, who made a spectacular over-the-shoulder catch to rob Mike Aviles of a base hit.	"He's not normal," second baseman Ian Kinsler said. "At first, I thought he had time to get under it or (Yoenis) Cespedes would get it, and then he just rips it out of the air. I was covering second going `What the heck just happened?"	Carlos Carrasco (2-2) took the loss for Cleveland, giving up five runs and nine hits and two walks in 4 1/3 innings.	The Tigers scored two runs in the first after Rajai Davis led off the inning with a triple. Kinsler drove him home with a single and scored on Victor Martinez's sacrifice fly.	Former Tiger Ryan Raburn made it 2-1 in the second with an RBI double, but was thrown out going for third. The Indians challenged the call, but it was upheld after a lengthy delay.	"I've seen the replay again, and I think he was probably safe, but I understand why they didn't overturn it," Indians manager Terry Francona said. "If they had originally called him safe, they would have probably stuck with that, too. It was just too close."	J.D. Martinez hit into a run-scoring double play in the third, but Brandon Moss pulled Cleveland within 3-2 with a RBI single in the fourth.	Francona decided to walk Victor Martinez and load the bases for J.D. Martinez in the fifth, but the move backfired when Martinez hit a two-run double to make it 5-2. Cabrera added a two-run homer in the sixth.	"I had a chance to get a double play against (J.D.) Martinez, but I got behind in the count, and when I tried to get a strike, he hit it," Carrasco said.	Michael Bourn, batting ninth for the first time in his career, beat out a double-play grounder in the seventh to make it 7-3, but the Indians still couldn't get a rally going against Lobstein.	Angel Nesbitt replaced Lobstein in the eighth, and gave up three straight singles to let the Indians cut the lead to 7-4. Nesbitt got one out before being replaced by Blaine Hardy. Moss hit a sacrifice fly, giving him nine RBIs in the three-game series, but Hardy got out of the inning with a two-run lead.	Cabrera's eighth-inning sacrifice fly gave the Tigers an 8-5 lead.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: After being a late scratch on Saturday, RHP Trevor Bauer (food poisoning) said he had gotten fluids on Sunday and is "hopeful" of being able to make his rescheduled start on Tuesday. ... C Yan Gomes (knee) is traveling with the team and says that his rehabilitation from an early season knee injury is going well. He is expected to return in late May.	Tigers: RHP Bruce Rondon, still recovering after Tommy John surgery that cost him all of 2014, threw 20 fastballs and five changeups on Saturday. He was going to rest his arm on Sunday, and if all goes well, throw a 30-pitch bullpen on Monday that includes 20 fastballs, five changeups and five curveballs. ... Davis left the game in the eighth with tightness in his groin after pulling up while running out a single.	UP NEXT	Indians: Cleveland heads home, where it has only played five times this season. Corey Kluber (0-2, 3.90) faces Jason Vargas (1-1, 6.75) in the opener, which starts at 6:10 as the Indians experiment with earlier starts for weekday games.	Tigers: After a 10-day homestand, the Tigers leave for a 10-game road trip that starts Monday in Minnesota. David Price (1-1, 3.28) starts the opener against Tommy Millone (2-0, 2.38).  The Tigers also visit Kansas City and Chicago on the trip.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CINCINNATI --  Rookie Addison Russell finished his first week in the majors with his biggest hit yet.	The youngest player in the National League doubled with the bases loaded on Sunday, and the Chicago Cubs held on for a 5-2 victory and a sweep of their rain-shortened series against the Cincinnati Reds.	The 21-year-old second baseman was in a slump when he broke the game open with his three-run double in the fourth inning off Anthony DeSclafani (2-1). Russell was called up on Tuesday and was only 2 for 19 with 11 strikeouts heading into that at-bat.	"I'm just understanding this whole process," Russell said. "It may be overnight, it may take a few games, it may take a few at-bats. I'm just trying to stay patient and stay with my approach and believe in my talent."	His teammates have seen enough to know that he has talent aplenty.	"Those are things he's going to be able to do more often the more comfortable he gets here," starter Jake Arrieta said. "He's had some at-bats where he looks a little, and the next time he comes up he has great swing at the ball."	Miguel Montero had a solo homer and a run-scoring single off DeSclafani, who had a streak of 16 scoreless innings snapped.	Arrieta (3-1) pitched six innings after waiting out a 4-hour, 13-minute delay before the Reds called off Saturday's game because of persistent rain. The Cubs won the series opener on Friday night, 7-3 in 11 innings.	Arrieta gave up four hits, including Todd Frazier's solo homer, and struck out six. Hector Rondon gave up a hit in the ninth while earning his fourth save in five chances.	The Cubs are 10-7 under first-year manager Joe Maddon, their best start since 2008 when they went 11-6. Chicago won the division that year under manager Lou Piniella.	Montero hit his 100th career homer in the second inning, ending the longest scoreless streak of DeSclafani's career and giving the Cubs a 1-0 lead.	The Cubs sent eight batters to the plate for four unearned runs in the fourth, set up by Frazier's fielding error at third base. Montero singled home a run, and the Reds intentionally walked Chris Coghlan with one out to load the bases and bring up the bottom of the order.	Arrieta struck out on three pitches, but Russell doubled off the base of the wall in right-center field for three runs. Russell was called up from the minors on Tuesday.	Arrieta retired the first 11 Reds -- only two of them got the ball out of the infield -- before Frazier homered. The Reds got another run in the fifth on Billy Hamilton's RBI forceout, but they left the bases loaded when Frazier fouled out and Brandon Phillips hit into a forceout.	The Reds have dropped three in a row overall. They went 0 for 20 with runners in scoring position during the two games against Chicago.	ROAD WINS	The Cubs went 4-2 on a trip to Pittsburgh and Cincinnati, leaving them 6-3 on the road overall.	GREAT PLAY	Shortstop Starlin Castro dived to get Brennan Boesch's short-hop grounder in the hole in the sixth inning. Getting up to his right knee, Castro threw him out at first base.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: Reliever Pedro Strop retired all three batters in the eighth. He'd been bothered the past few days by a sore toe.	Reds: Slumping right fielder Jay Bruce was out of the lineup even though he was healthy, getting a day to regroup. Bruce pinch hit in the ninth and struck out.	ON DECK	Cubs: Chicago returns to Wrigley Field for a six-game homestand against Pittsburgh and Milwaukee. Jason Hammel (1-1) faces Vance Worley (2-1).	Reds: Milwaukee visits for a three-game series. Jimmy Nelson (1-1) faces Jason Marquis (1-1), making his fourth start for the Reds.	---	Follow Joe Kay on Twitter: http://twitter.com/apjoekay	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

MIAMI --  Giancarlo Stanton needed all of his considerable strength to maintain a stoic expression after he overcame his own baserunning blunder by crawling back to third base.	When Stanton scored moments later and reached the dugout, he finally allowed himself a big grin.	The Miami Marlins were a laughingstock for the first two weeks of the season, but they're all smiles now. Adeiny Hechavarria hit a bases-loaded triple after a botched rundown saved Stanton and kept the inning alive, and Miami completed its first three-game sweep of the Washington Nationals since May 2012 by winning 6-2 Sunday.	"When we play our way, when we play relaxed and loose and confident, we're as good as anybody," manager Mike Redmond said.	The Marlins earned their fifth consecutive victory after a 3-11 start. Meanwhile, the defending NL East champion Nationals (7-12) lost their fifth game in a row -- their longest skid since July 2013 -- and fell behind Miami into fourth place in the division.	"We surely didn't want to start like this," said Bryce Harper, who hit his fifth homer. "We're a great team, and we'll get it going."	Stanton hit an RBI triple off the top lip of the center field wall, reached on an infield single and scored twice. Miami hit three triples in a game for the first time since 2000.	Washington's Gio Gonzalez (1-2) allowed 10 hits and six runs in five innings, hiking his ERA to 5.01. The left-hander had won his past five starts against Miami, his hometown team.	Dee Gordon, who came into the game leading the NL with 28 hits, had four singles for Miami and raised his average to .390. Ichiro Suzuki had two hits, including an RBI single, and is batting .304.	Miami outhit Washington 14-4.	Dan Haren (2-1) needed 91 pitches to get through five innings but allowed only two runs, including the sixth homer he has given up in 24 innings this year.	The 6-foot-6 Stanton hustled to overcome his baserunning mistake with two outs in the fourth. He tried to score from second base on an infield single, and got hung up 30 feet from the plate.	Catcher Wilson Ramos chased him all the way back to third, pumping but never throwing, and Stanton made an awkward headfirst dive and then crawled to the bag.	"I dove a little early and I still didn't get tagged, so I crawled," Stanton said. "I shouldn't have been in that situation, but luckily I was able to get out of it, and Hech came up clutch.""	The bizarre sequence loaded the bases, and the Nationals -- who rank last in the majors in fielding -- paid for their mistake when Hechavarria tripled to put Miami ahead, 3-1.	Ramos declined to talk to reporters.	"I don't know why Willie didn't give the ball up, but he decided not to," Nationals manager Matt Williams said. "The big inning was the result of us not executing."	Hechavarria started the season 1 for 22 but has since batted .460 since. He ranks among the major-league leaders with 16 RBIs.	"I feel great at the plate right now," Hechavarria said.	The sweep in the first meeting of the year between the division rivals was a big turnaround after Washington won 13 of 19 against Miami last year.	STANTON'S BLAST	Stanton's triple, only the ninth of his career, traveled about 415 feet to spacious center field.	"You never know with center field here. It's like the Everglades," he said. "If I ever want to go for the cycle, now I know where to hit it."	ROOF CLOSED	The Marlins' retractable roof hasn't been open since their rain-delay gaffe opening day. It was closed Sunday not because of rain, but because of heat -- 94 degrees at game time.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals RHP Max Scherzer will likely be scratched from his next scheduled start Tuesday at Atlanta, Williams said. Scherzer tested his right thumb by throwing off flat ground and said it's still sore. He jammed it batting Thursday.	"We'll probably have to make an adjustment," Williams said. "I don't anticipate him missing more than one turn."	UP NEXT	Nationals: RHP Doug Fister (1-0, 2.37) starts Monday in the opener of a three-game series at Atlanta against Eric Stults (0-1, 4.50).	Marlins: RHP Jarred Cosart (1-1, 3.63) starts Monday when they begin a three-game series against the Mets and Dillon Gee (0-1, 5.60). The Mets swept Miami in a four-game series a week ago.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

The Associated Press	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  There was some doubt over whether Chris Archer would even be able to pitch Sunday. When he did make the start, the Rays right-hander exceeded all expectations, even his own.	"I was honestly thinking if I could get through five (innings), that was going to preserve our bullpen a little bit," Archer said after pitching seven scoreless innings in a 5-1 win over the Toronto Blue Jays. "But my pitch count was in a good place and I still felt like I had a little bit left in me so they let me go."	Archer, who had been sick for two days, gave up two hits and Brandon Guyer drove in four runs as the Rays won their fifth straight.	Archer (3-2) became the first American League pitcher to go four starts within one season without giving up an earned run since Zach Greinke did it for Kansas City in 2009.	Archer allowed an unearned run in a 1-0 loss to Boston on Tuesday, but he has not given up an earned run since opening day, a span of 26 2/3 innings.	"I don't think we could ask for a better month out of a starting pitcher. He's been as good as I've ever seen," said Rays manager Kevin Cash.	"You've seen him over the last couple years and he gets better and better and better," said Toronto manager John Gibbons. "He's got a dynamite arm, he's confident and a great athlete."	Evan Longoria had three straight hits and a walk for the Rays after going 4 for 4 on Saturday. Longoria's batting average rose from .218 to .306 in two games.	Guyer hit the second pitch from Mark Buehrle (3-1) for a home run, his first of the season.	Logan Forsythe drove in another run for the Rays in the first inning with a double after Longoria's single.	Guyer made it 3-0 with a sacrifice fly in the fourth, then broke the game open with a two-out, two-run single off Buerhle in the sixth.	"We had the bases loaded with no outs, and I feel like in that situation we definitely needed to get a run, and it gave us some more momentum," Guyer said. "With the way our bullpen is going, with a couple more runs we're definitely confident of getting that W."	Matt Andriese pitched the final two innings for the Rays.	Tim Beckham had two hits for Tampa Bay and scored twice.	Buehrle, who had been supported by 12 or more runs in each of his three preceding starts, gave up five runs on 13 hits in 5 2/3 innings.	"I feel better about this game than I did the previous two," Buehrle said. "But when you're up against a guy like Archer, he's been on this year."	The Blue Jays scored six runs in losing three straight at Tropicana Field, where they are 11-21 since 2012.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: RF Jose Bautista (sore right shoulder) missed his fifth straight game. He hit in an indoor cage and Gibbons is hopeful the slugger will return to the lineup in the next couple days. ... INF Maicer Izturis (groin) is progressing but not close to playing in minor league games.	Rays: CF Desmond Jennings, who left after seven innings Saturday due to left knee soreness, didn't play.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays: RHP Aaron Sanchez (1-2, 5.14 ERA) will face Boston RHP Joe Kelly (1-0, 4.08 ERA) Monday night.	Rays: Tampa Bay plays it first game in open air Monday night at the New York Yankees. "I want to put some sunglasses on for batting practice," Rays manager Kevin Cash said with a smile. The game at Yankee Stadium will be Tampa Bay's 20th of the season. No major league team has ever gone this far into a season playing all their games under a roof.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

BALTIMORE --  The Baltimore Orioles circled the bases more often than ever before under Buck Showalter, twice scoring six runs in an inning and pounding out 20 hits without even batting in the ninth.	After the infield dirt had finally settled, however, Showalter was far more interested in talking about his starting pitcher.	Delmon Young drove in five runs, Chris Davis homered and the Orioles received a bounce-back pitching performance from Bud Norris in an 18-7 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Sunday.	It was Baltimore's most prolific offensive showing since an 18-9 win over Cleveland on April 19, 2006, and the most runs the Orioles ever scored against Boston.	So Buck, what was more important? All that those runs or Norris taking a shutout into the seventh inning?	"Bud, without a doubt," Showalter replied.	Norris (1-2) didn't need to be sharp. But he was, and that was important because he came into the game with a 17.42 ERA.	"That's the Bud that pitched well for us last year," Showalter said. "This guy won 15 games last year and he was in attack mode today."	Norris didn't allow a runner past second base until Pablo Sandoval hit a three-run drive in the seventh, his first home run with Boston since signing as a free agent in November.	Hanley Ramirez followed Sandoval's long ball with a solo shot off Jason Garcia and added a three-run homer off Garcia in the ninth.	None of that mattered, because the Boston pitching staff had its worst outing since a 20-2 loss at Oakland in August 2012.	"I will say in general, we have to do better in all phases of the game," manager John Farrell said, "and it starts with how the game is controlled from the mound."	Baltimore went ahead 7-0 with a six-run third inning and led 12-0 in the sixth. Davis, Jimmy Paredes and Steve Pearce each contributed three RBIs to the Orioles' second straight win following a five-game skid.	Young, Davis, Paredes and Rey Navarro each had three hits.	Boston starter Wade Miley (1-2) gave up six earned runs and five hits in 2 1/3 innings, the second time in four starts this season the left-hander failed to go three innings.	"It's embarrassing. I know I'm better than this," Miley said. "I'm not even giving us ... a chance at all."	After scoring an unearned run in the second inning, Baltimore sent 10 batters to the plate in the third.	Miley issued two straight four-pitch walks to force in a run, then gave up an RBI single to Young before Davis hit a liner that glanced off the glove of center fielder Mookie Betts for a two-run double. Pearce chased Miley with a run-scoring bloop single and Paredes capped the uprising with an RBI grounder.	Young singled in two runs in the fourth to make it 9-0. Navarro had an RBI single in the fifth and Davis hit a two-run drive in the sixth.	Boston closed to 12-4 in the seventh, but Baltimore answered with six runs in the bottom half, the key hit a two-run double by Young.	STAT PACK	Red Sox: Ramirez's next HR will be his 200th ... Miley lost his first April road game in 11 career starts (4-1). ... The Red Sox went 2-4 on a road trip that began in Tampa Bay. They allowed 19 runs in the first five games before surrendering 18 in the finale.	Orioles: Navarro had his first career RBI and his first three-hit game. ... The Orioles have 14 errors in 19 games compared to nine at the same time last year.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: RHP Matt Barnes, recalled Saturday after OF Shane Victorino (hamstring) went on the DL, was optioned to Triple-A Pawtucket. RHP Heath Hembree was recalled to take his place.	Orioles: SS J.J. Hardy (left shoulder strain) will need only three or four rehabilitation games after he's ready to go on assignment, Showalter said.	ON DECK	Red Sox: Boston RHP Joe Kelly (1-0, 4.08 ERA) faces his fourth different AL East foe this season, at home against Toronto on Monday night.	Orioles: Baltimore plays its first game against a non-division opponent, sending Ubaldo Jimenez to the mound Monday night against the visiting Chicago White Sox.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PHILADELPHIA --  Ryan Howard was one of baseball's most potent sluggers, the kind that frayed pitcher's nerves and helped turn Philadelphia into perennial pennant contenders.	Once feared, Howard now faces criticism that he's finished.	With a fragile frame, a hefty contract, and production that plummeted faster than the Phillies' fall in the NL East, Howard was dangled as trade bait over the winter.	He's still in Philly -- it's the baseballs that are finally starting to head out.	Howard hit his second homer in two games, leading the Philadelphia Phillies past the Atlanta Braves 5-4 on Sunday.	Howard's miserable season had already cost him his cleanup spot in the order, and he entered the game batting .189. Howard hit a two-run homer on Friday and a three-run shot in the first inning against Trevor Cahill (0-3) on Sunday.	Howard, who once hit 45 or more homers in a season each year from 2006 to 2009, has all three of his homers in the last five games after hitting none in the first 11 and bumped his average up to .193.	"I've been feeling like I've been swinging it pretty well," he said. "The results may not necessarily show, but it's all about how you're feeling with the swings. Eventually, they're going to start to drop."	Howard was dropped from fourth to seventh in Philadelphia's lineup earlier this month, the lowest in the order he'd batted in almost 10 years. Even with a sub.-200 average, Howard hit fifth against Cahill.	Howard has $60 million remaining in his $125 million, five-year contract he signed with the Phillies in 2010, leaving the franchise with few options for their 35-year-old former slugger.	Howard could possibly help his trade value with a few more homers and an uptick in batting average. In a rebuilding mode and in last place in the NL East, the Phillies would certainly have to eat a large portion of Howard's salary in any potential deal.	"I feel fine," Howard said. "All you can do is go out there and swing the bat."	Jonathan Papelbon had his fourth save. He allowed Alberto Callaspo's pinch-hit solo homer in the ninth.	Ben Revere knocked in the go-ahead run with a triple and the Phillies won two of three games in the series.	Jerome Williams (2-1) allowed three runs and eight hits in 6 2/3 innings for the Phillies.	Howard knocked a full-count pitch in the front row of the right field seats for a 3-2 lead. Chase Utley, who walked, scored on that homer. Like Howard, the 2008 World Series champion holdover is having his own awful season. Utley has continued to bat third, even though he's batting .121 (7 for 58) with two homers and nine RBIs.	The Braves scored twice in the first when a pair of walks came back to get Williams. Jace Peterson's two-RBI single to right gave the Braves an early lead. They tied it 3-all in the third when Kelly Johnson ripped a shot off Howard's glove and the ball bounced away for what was ruled a double.	Revere made it 4-3 in the fifth, and the Phillies tacked on an unearned run in the seventh.	Williams won his second straight start and three other relievers combined to finish off the Braves.	Cahill allowed four runs in six innings, his longest outing of the season.	"One bad pitch, but I bounced back pretty good after that," Cahill said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Neither team had any injuries of note. Papelbon pitched a day after he had a migraine headache.	UP NEXT	Braves: RHP Doug Fister (1-0, 2.37 ERA) gets the call when the Braves open a three-game series Monday against Washington. The Braves head home to open a 10-game homestand, which includes a four-game set with the Reds and three with the Phillies.	Phillies: LHP Cole Hamels (0-2, 3.75 ERA) gets the call in the opener of a four-game series Monday at St. Louis. But all eyes are on RHP Severino Gonzalez who will make his major league debut Tuesday. The 22-year-old is 1-1 with a 3.57 ERA in three starts for Triple-A Lehigh Valley. He was the 2013 winner of the Paul Owens Award as the best pitcher in Philadelphia's minor league system. He has walked only 67 in 415 1/3 innings.	SAVED	Papelbon earned his 329th career save, moving him into a tie with Francisco Cordero for 14th on the career list. Papelbon, already Boston's career saves leader with 219, earned his 110th with the Phillies and is just two shy of Jose Mesa's franchise record of 112.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.
