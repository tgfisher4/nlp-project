DETROIT (AP) -- Jim Thome again provided the Chicago White Sox	with power, and for a change his teammates gave him some help.	Thome and Joe Crede hit two-run homers and Paul Konerko added a	solo shot, leading Chicago to a 5-3 victory Monday in the Detroit	Tigers' home opener.	When Thome made it 2-all in the third with his fourth home run,	he remained the only White Sox player to clear the fences this	season. In the sixth, Crede ended the non-Thome homer drought and	put the White Sox ahead. Konerko restored their two-run lead in the	eighth.	"I knew we were going to hit," said Freddy Garcia, who gave up	three runs and five hits over six innings for his 100th win. "We	have a great lineup."	Thome, who has been used solely as a designated hitter, was	acquired from Philadelphia in November for outfielder Aaron Rowand	and two pitchers. Thome hit just seven homers in 59 games last	season, limited by elbow and back injuries.	"As long as Jim is healthy, we know he can help this	ballclub," Chicago manager Ozzie Guillen said. "Being a DH will	help him because it keeps him out of the field."	The last time the White Sox played at Comerica Park was Sept.	29, when they clinched the AL Central en route to their first World	Series title since 1917.	"I think that game set everything up for the playoffs,"	Guillen said. "People were talking a lot of stuff about us, about	how we choke, but after we clinched here, it took a lot of pressure	off the players."	Garcia (1-1) bounced back with a solid outing after allowing	seven runs and nine hits over four innings in his first start, a	loss to Cleveland.	Chicago has won two straight after losing four in a row.	Jeremy Bonderman (1-1) allowed four runs and six hits in seven	innings for the Tigers. Detroit has lost two straight following a	5-0 start under new manager Jim Leyland.	"It was a good ballgame -- just a bad outcome," Leyland said.	Leyland, who led Florida to the 1997 World Series title and was	a two-time NL manager of the Year in Pittsburgh, is back in the	dugout for the first time since quitting in Colorado following the	1999 season.	His 15th season as a major league manager is with the Tigers,	who signed him as a minor league catcher in 1963 and he began his	career in the dugout in 1971 with Detroit's farm team in the	Appalachian League.	After Sparky Anderson chose to not include Leyland on his	coaching staff in the late 1970s, Leyland left to be the White Sox	third-base coach in 1982. A Comerica Park-record crowd of 44,179	gave him perhaps the loudest pregame ovation.	"I don't know if they will Wednesday, but that was a good	feeling," Leyland said of the cheers.	Detroit went ahead 2-0 on Craig Monroe's two-run homer in the	second inning, one pitch after Carlos Guillen walked. Thome tied	the game in the third with a two-run shot, homering for the second	straight day.	Chicago took a 4-2 lead with another two-out homer, Crede's in	the sixth. Chris Shelton's RBI double pulled the Tigers within a	run in the home half.	Brandon McCarthy relieved Garcia in the seventh and pitched two	solid innings and Bobby Jenks pitched a perfect ninth for his	second save.	Game notes	Thome's homer was his 434th, tying Juan Gonzalez for 34th.	Thome is seventh among active players. ... Detroit closer Todd	Jones, on the 15-day DL with a pulled left hamstring, threw off a	mound and said he felt good. ... Through their first seven games,	the Tigers haven't committed an error -- their best streak to start	a season since 1951. ... Detroit native Jerome Bettis, who helped	the Pittsburgh Steelers win the Super Bowl next door at Ford Field,	threw out the ceremonial first pitch. ... The White Sox was 14-5	against Detroit last season. ... Shelton was selected the AL player	of the week Monday.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Everything about the Dodgers-Pirates rivalry	was how Jim Tracy remembered it. The Dodgers jumping  out to an	early lead. Olmedo Saenz getting an important hit. The offense	being more than good enough.	Tracy's only problem is he's now in the opposing dugout.	Jason Repko homered and tripled to drive in four runs in the	first two innings, and the Dodgers roughed up their former	manager's new team, beating the Pirates 8-3 Monday in Pittsburgh's	home opener. The Pirates are 1-7 -- their worst start since they had	the same record in 1974, when they went on to win a division title.	"One-and-7 obviously isn't the way you want to start," Tracy	said. "But the [Dodgers] team I managed last year started 12-2 and	we won 71 games. So it's not a large enough sample size of games.	It doesn't mean this is the kind of team we're going to be for the	next six months."	Tracy's Dodgers were 427-383 in five seasons, or 44 games above	.500. And nearly half of that edge came from being 20 games above	.500 against the Pirates -- 27-7. Los Angeles is 16-3 in Pittsburgh	since 2001 and has won nine of 10 and 19 of 22 overall against the	Pirates.	Tracy was allowed to leave by the Dodgers following a 91-loss	season that was one of their worst since relocating from Brooklyn	in 1958. He became the first former Dodgers manager to oppose the	club since Leo Durocher managed the Astros in 1973.	"Obviously, it's kind of special," Tracy said.	At least until the game started.	Actor Michael Keaton requested a mulligan and got it after	throwing the ceremonial first pitch into the dirt, and responded by	throwing a pitch down the middle. Pirates left-hander Zach Duke	(0-1) probably wished he could do the same after walking Rafael	Furcal ahead of Repko's first homer, a drive into the left-field	seats on an 0-2 pitch. Cody Ross followed later in the first with a	run-scoring double as the Dodgers scored two or more runs in the	first inning for the fifth time in seven games.	Duke, fifth in the 2005 NL Rookie of the Year voting after going	8-2 with a 1.81 ERA in half a season, fought with his control all	afternoon as the Dodgers opened a 7-0 lead by the fifth. Duke threw	only 48 of 94 pitches for strikes.	"I was all over the place," Duke said. "My release point was	all over the place, and I couldn't make key pitches."	Duke got into trouble again in the second by walking pitcher	Odalis Perez on five pitches, and Furcal doubled ahead of Repko's	two-run triple that made it 5-0.	"I had two strikes on me both of those at-bats and I'm just up	there trying to stay alive, put the ball in play and get something	out of the at-bat," said Repko, 0-for-4 against Duke last season.	"I had two solid at-bats."	Saenz added a two-run homer in the fifth during a three-hit day	and is 9-of-14 with three homers and 11 RBI in four games in	Pittsburgh over the last two seasons.	"Believe me, I don't try to get into it," Saenz said. "Maybe	I hit the ball better here than in other parks."	Perez (1-0) limited the already slumping Pirates to one run and	five hits over 5 1-3 innings after giving up seven runs and nine	hits in three innings in his first start.	Perez allowed six runners over the first three innings but	wasn't lifted until Franquelis Osoria came on to get Jose Castillo	and Humberto Cota in succession with runners on second and third	and a run in during the sixth. Takashi Saito also got the Dodgers	out of a jam in the seventh, getting Castillo to ground into an	inning-ending force play with the bases loaded and two runs in.	The Pirates' Jason Bay brought a .375 average into the game only	to go 1-for-5 and strand seven runners.	"A few guys on this team probably tried to do too much a few	times, myself included," Bay said.	Game Notes	The sellout crowd of 39,129 on a sunny afternoon with	temperatures in the mid 60s was the second-largest since PNC Park	opened in 2001, topped only by the 39,392 who turned out on Aug.	11, 2002. ... Saenz is 6-for-7 with two homers and five RBI	against Duke. ... The only other former Dodgers managers to oppose	the club since 1900, according to team research, are Chuck Dressen,	Casey Stengel and Ned Hanlon. ... SS Jack Wilson stole second base	in the first, the Pirates' first stolen base in eight games. ...	The Pirates were 3-5 after eight games last season before finishing	with 95 losses. ... The Dodgers haven't lost a series to Pittsburgh	since 1998.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

HOUSTON (AP) -- Eric Bruntlett sat in the Houston Astros' dugout	for hours on Monday wondering, as he usually does, whether he would	play.	When manager Phil Garner finally called on his valued reserve in	the 12th inning, Bruntlett produced a game-winning sacrifice fly	that scored Craig Biggio in a 5-4 win over the Washington	Nationals.	"You've been sitting around for three-plus hours, and then you	have to come in and get the job done," Bruntlett said. "It isn't	easy."	Bruntlett is used to it. He won two games last season in the	Astros' final at-bat, including a three-run homer that ended a	14-inning game in Washington last July.	"He's tremendous," Lance Berkman said. "The thing that makes	him so good is he can sit over there for a week with almost no	activity, and when you call upon him, he's always ready to go."	Biggio led off the 12th inning with a double and advanced on	Willy Taveras' bunt. Biggio was 0-for-5 before lining his 608th	double off the metal scoreboard in left field.	"He didn't have a lot of good swings," Garner said of Biggio.	"True to the Hall of Fame moniker he'll be wearing, he came	through."	Mike Stanton (0-1) intentionally walked Berkman and Morgan	Ensberg, who had homered off Chad Cordero in the 10th to tie the	game at 4-4.	Bruntlett, pinch hitting for reliever Chad Qualls, hit a high	fly to center fielder Brandon Watson, and Biggio crouched at third	as he awaited the catch. Watson's throw home was high and late, and	Biggio easily slid in with the winning run.	Bruntlett's fly ball was shallow, but Biggio noticed Watson went	flat-footed for a split-second before throwing home. Third-base	coach Doug Mansolino told Biggio to go.	"I'm just trying to get the best jump I can," Biggio said.	"If he tells me to go, I'm going."	Houston took three out of four from the Nationals, who play	their home opener Tuesday against the New York Mets.	Jose Vidro, who had eight RBI in the series, was looking	forward to heading home after starting the season with seven	straight road games.	"I thought we could've won more than two," Vidro said.	"2-and-five. Basically, I'm not pleased with that. We've got to go	home and get back on the right track."	Berkman and Preston Wilson homered for Houston -- the fourth time	they've homered in the same game.	"It's one of those anomalies," Berkman said. "I couldn't tell	you what's going on."	Wilson, acquired in January to boost the Astros' offense, had a	simpler explanation.	"I'm jealous," he said with a smile. "Hopefully, we'll keep	it up."	Washington, which trailed 3-1, went ahead 4-3 when pinch-hitter	Daryle Ward hit a solo homer off Brad Lidge in the 10th.	Ensberg answered in the bottom half against Cordero with his	first home run of the season.	Lidge, who gave up homers to Albert Pujols in the NL	championship series and Scott Podsednik in the World Series, was	replaced in the 11th by Chad Qualls (1-1), who got the final six	outs.	"Brad, obviously, didn't want to take the loss," Ensberg said.	"I think he was pretty happy when he saw that ball go over the	fence."	Vidro had two RBI singles for the Nationals, who played the	series finale without manager Frank Robinson. Bench coach Eddie	Rodriguez led the team as Robinson served a one-game suspension for	his role in last Thursday's game against the New York Mets, in	which five batters were hit by pitches.	Nationals starter John Patterson gave up three runs and five	hits in six innings, and Houston's Wandy Rodriguez allowed three	runs and seven hits in seven innings.	Berkman hit his third first-inning homer of the season, and	Wilson homered in the second for a 2-0 lead. Wilson also crashed	into the left-field wall to catch a deep fly by Nick Johnson and	Berkman leaned into the crowd to snare a foul by Matt LeCroy.	Vidro had his first RBI single in the third, and Eric Munson hit	a sacrifice fly that made it 3-1 in the fourth. Byrd grounded into	a run-scoring double play in the fifth, and Vidro's single later in	the inning tied it.	Game Notes	Berkman, a switch hitter, has hit all four of his homers	from the left side. ... Vice President Dick Cheney is to throw out	the ceremonial first pitch at the Nationals' home opener Tuesday	against the New York Mets. ... The Nationals have been outscored	19-7 in the first through third innings.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The new Busch Stadium was both a hitter's and	pitcher's park in its opening game -- at least for Mark Mulder.	The Cardinals' left-hander worked into the ninth inning and hit	his first career home run to help St. Louis beat the Milwaukee Brewers 6-4 on Monday in the first major-league game at the $365	million ballpark.	-------------------INLINE TABLE (BEGIN)-------------------	-------------------INLINE TABLE (END)-------------------	"It was just his day," the Brewers' Bill Hall said. "And	there's nothing we could do about it."	Mulder batted only .145 in his first NL season last year. But	the exploits of Jason Marquis, who batted .310 with a homer and 10	RBI, and the rest of a staff that keeps close track of its hitting	gave him incentive to improve his offense.	"He's happy for me, but I think way deep down inside he's	mad," Mulder said of Marquis. "He just won't admit it. They	already said I'm icing my back because I was swinging too hard."	Scott Rolen's two-run double in the fourth off Tomo Ohka (0-1)	gave the Cardinals the lead for good and Albert Pujols hit his	fourth homer, a drive to the left-center power alley estimated at	445 feet.	The Cardinals' first full day at the new ballpark began on a	festive note, with Pujols and Chris Carpenter, the NL MVP and Cy	Young Award winners, throwing out dual ceremonial first pitches to	retired Cardinals greats Willie McGee and Bob Gibson. It stayed	festive most of the day for a sellout crowd of 41,936 anxious for	something positive after the Cardinals got swept at Chicago.	"It's nice to be home," Jim Edmonds said. "It's been a long	six weeks in spring training and then start off on the road. It's a	beautiful place and I'm glad we could pull out a win for	everybody."	Before Monday, the Cardinals only had a brief walkthrough and	tour of the stadium. Sidney Ponson was the only major-leaguer to	participate in a game involving the franchise's top farm clubs last	Tuesday, with the rest of the Cardinals in Philadelphia for their	season-opening series.	"There's a lot of pieces that remind you of the old Busch,	especially in a 3 o'clock game when it's about 5 and you can't	hardly see," manager Tony La Russa said. "It think it's a	beautiful ballpark."	Hall's two-run homer in the second was the only damage off	Mulder (1-0). Hall was 3-for-4 with a pair of doubles for	Milwaukee, which has lost two straight after a 5-0 start that put	the Brewers in the NL Central lead.	But they put a scare into the Cardinals with two runs in the	ninth and the go-ahead run at the plate.	"We've got a bunch of young kids that have a lot of heart,"	manager Ned Yost said. "Anytime you're down four runs and get the	winning run to the plate in the ninth you've done something."	Mulder allowed seven hits in eight-plus innings, struck out five	and walked one. He also was 2-for-3 with a double on a hop off the	center-field wall and a walk -- coming in he had a .116 career	average with four RBI in 86 at-bats.	"Mulder's always tough," the Brewers' Geoff Jenkins said after	going 2-for-3 against him with a pair of singles. "He makes great	pitches and always hits his spots."	Mulder's two-run shot off Jose Capellan in the seventh put the	Cardinals ahead 6-2. The double was his first career extra-base	hit.	"Going around second, I really didn't feel anything," Mulder	said. "I was just trying not to smile or laugh running around the	bases, because I wanted to. It was a cool experience, but I'm sure	there's probably not a good chance of that happening any more this	year."	Mulder also started the final home opener at the old Busch	Stadium last year in addition to pitching the final game at the	40-year-old park last fall in a Game 6 NL Championship Series loss	to the Houston Astros.	After Jenkins led off with a bloop single in the ninth,	Braden Looper came in and got Carlos Lee to ground into a double	play. Hall then doubled and scored on a single by Rickie Weeks.	St. Louis brought in Jason Isringhausen, who allowed Michael Barrett's go-ahead grand slam in an 8-4 loss to the Cubs at Wrigley	Field on Sunday night. Isringhausen gave up Prince Fielder's RBI	single and walked pinch-hitter Corey Koskie before retiring Gabe Gross, another pinch-hitter, on a groundout for his third save.	"It was fun to get out there again," Isringhausen said. "When	things are going bad, it seems like it snowballs, but things will	be fine."	Ohka gave up four runs, six hits and four walks in four innings.	"Tomo just kind of struggled all day with command," Yost said.	After the Cardinals left the bases loaded in the first and	stranded two in the second, Pujols homered leading off the third	and Yadier Molina hit a sacrifice fly later in the inning. Rolen's	go-ahead homer gave him nine RBI to tie for the team lead with	Pujols -- Rolen had a career-low 28 last year, when a shoulder	injury limited him to 56 games.	Game notes	Lee singled in the second, the 14th time he reached base in	26 plate appearances. But he was hitless the rest of the way,	finishing 1-for-4 with a pair of double-play balls.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Braves had to go with a replacement	to get the sort of effort they're used to getting from their	starters.	Too bad John Thomson spent so much time on the basepaths.	Thomson went five strong innings in his first start of the year	and Marcus Giles hit a tiebreaking homer in the seventh inning to	give the Braves a win in their home opener, 5-3 over the	Philadelphia Phillies on Monday night.	Thomson went 2-for-2 at the plate, putting Atlanta ahead with a	two-run double in the fourth. But all that extra running tired him	out, and he came out an inning earlier that planned after throwing	72 pitches.	"He was gassed," manager Bobby Cox said. "He shouldn't get so	many hits so he doesn't have to run so much."	Thomson didn't get the win -- the bullpen squandered a 3-1 lead	after he came out -- but he still gave a major boost to a	beleaguered rotation that had an ERA of 10.09 over the first seven	games, giving up 34 earned runs in 30 1-3 innings.	"That's what we're used to around here," Giles said. "That's	what we're going to get. We have too many good starters to let that	happen."	Not surprisingly, the Braves entered the night ranked last in	the NL with an ERA of 7.58 -- a startling spot for a team that	usually ranks at or near the top of the league in pitching.	Thomson didn't even start the season in the rotation. He was the	odd man out of a six-man contest in the spring, but reclaimed his	familiar role after Horacio Ramirez went on the disabled list.	"I've been doing this my whole life," said Thomson, who had	only one relief appearance in 196 career games before making two	last week. "It's all I've ever known. This is more of a comfort	zone for me."	The Braves, coming off a 3-4 West Coast trip to start the	season, made their Turner Field debut before a sellout crowd of	47,332 that included former President Carter, who wore a Braves cap	and watched from a box next to the Atlanta dugout with his wife,	Rosalyn.	Giles' first homer and RBI of the season came in the seventh off	Ryan Franklin (0-1). Andruw Jones also homered for the Braves, his	third of the season.	Chris Reitsma, who blew a lead the previous day by giving up two	ninth-inning runs in San Francisco, was booed when he entered the	game in the ninth. But he pitched a perfect inning for his third	save in four chances.	"It's nice to have a nice, clean win," Reitsma said. "The	1-2-3 (inning) is obviously great. But the goal is to get it done	before the other team scores."	Atlanta jumped ahead in the fourth with a two-out rally. Brian	McCann and Wilson Betemit singled before Thomson drove a pitch from	Brett Myers over the head of center fielder Aaron Roward for a	bases-clearing double.	Betemit started at third for Chipper Jones, who went on the	15-day disabled list with a sprained knee and ankle.	Philadelphia picked up an unearned run in the fifth when Atlanta	right fielder Jeff Francoeur let Rowand's single skip by him and	roll to the wall. Jimmy Rollins scored all the way from first to	make it 2-1.	Andruw Jones restored the Braves' two-run lead with a 410-foot	homer to center field off Myers in the bottom half, producing	another two-out run for Atlanta. Myers went five innings, giving up	seven hits and three runs while striking out six.	"I made two bad pitches," he said. "I threw a good cutter to	everybody but (Thomson). What are you going to do? The one to	Andruw, I didn't expect him to swing at it. It wasn't a great	pitch, but he hit it."	After Thomson left, the Braves' shaky bullpen let Philadelphia	back in the game. Mike Remlinger got only one out in the sixth	before Lance Cormier gave up a run-scoring single to David Bell.	Philadelphia tied it up in the seventh on Bobby Abreu's	sacrifice fly off Oscar Villareal (3-0), who blew one for Thomson	but became the first three-game winner in the majors.	Rollins of the Phillies went 3-for-4 with a walk and has now hit	safely in 42 of 43 games. The only hitless game, of course, snapped	a 38-game streak that stretched back to last season.	Now, he's got a new streak going, hitting safely in four	straight. But he's not getting much help from his teammates.	"We're waiting on the big hit," Rollins said. "It just hasn't	come. It's single, single."	No one if struggling has much as Francoeur. Last year's rookie	sensation went 0-for-4 and is now just 2-of-33 (.061) on the	season.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- A familiar result on the scoreboard	didn't spoil a new beginning for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.	Erik Bedard scattered four hits over seven scoreless innings	Monday night, helping the Baltimore Orioles beat Tampa Bay 6-3 in	the Devil Rays' home debut under new principal owner Stuart	Sternberg.	A crowd of 40,199 -- only the fourth sellout in the franchise's	nine seasons -- packed Tropicana Field and coming up short on the	scoreboard was the farthest thing from Sternberg's mind.	"It's a great feeling," the beaming New York investor said.	"It was just pleasing that the people cared enough to come out.	They were here for what really was a new beginning."	Jay Gibbons kept up his hot hitting against Tampa Bay with a	solo homer and bases-loaded infield single off Seth McClung (0-2),	who also lost to Bedard and the Orioles last Wednesday in	Baltimore.	Gibbons is 6-for-13 with two homers and seven RBI in three	games against Tampa Bay this season. David Newhan also drove in a	run with a third-inning single and Ramon Hernandez finished the	Orioles' four-run third with a two-run single.	Bedard (2-0) allowed four singles, struck out five and walked	two to beat the Devils Rays for the second time in less than a	week. LaTroy Hawkins pitched the eighth and gave up a two-out RBI	triple to Aubrey Huff.	Despite the loss, it was an exciting night for Sternberg, who	took control from Vince Naimoli last fall and has gone out of his	way to make the franchise more fan-friendly and initiate other	changes he hopes will make the franchise more productive on the	field.	The owner shook hands, signed autographs and chatted with fans	filing through the main entrance to the club's the oft-criticized	domed stadium that's undergone a $10 million facelift for this	season.	Sternberg restructured ticket prices, lowered concession prices	and introduced free parking for fans, who also are allowed to hold	tailgating parties and bring their own food into the park for the	first time.	Monday also marked the reopening of the Ted Williams Museum and	Hitters Hall of Fame, which was moved from nearby Citrus County to	Tropicana Field during spring training, an addition the Devil Rays	hope attracts more fans.	But what Sternberg is counting on more than anything else is	improvement on the field. There were few signs of that Monday night	until it was too late.	Still, first-year manager Joe Maddon said the result was not	indicative of the direction the team is headed.	"It was a good night. ... You're disappointed, but I'm not	disappointed in the guys. We ran into a good pitcher," Maddon	said. "We lost tonight because they pitched better. But the guys	came ready to play and they're going to just keep getting better	and better."	Toby Hall had two of the four hits off Bedard, then hit a	two-run homer off Tim Byrdak to trim Baltimore's lead to 6-3 in the	ninth. Right-hander Chris Ray got three outs for his second save.	Bedard worked out of situations with runners in scoring position	in the fourth, sixth and seventh inning, preserving his shutout in	the seventh when he fielded Nick Green's one-out grounder to the	mound and threw out Jonny Gomes trying to score from third base.	"I thought the big step Erik took was the one inning when he	was borderline, his pitch count was up and he battled to get out of	it," Baltimore manager Sam Perlozzo said. "I thought that was a	big step for him to show that he can carry it into late in the	game."	Game notes	Miguel Tejada was 3-for-4, including a RBI double in the	ninth, for Baltimore. ... McClung allowed five runs and seven hits	in five innings. He walked three and struck out three. ... Gibbons	has a hit in all six games he's played. ... The Devil Rays honored	late Hall of Famer Al Lopez with a video tribute. The son, grandson	and great grandson of the only Tampa native enshrined at	Cooperstown threw the ceremonial first pitches. Tampa natives and	former major leaguers Tino Martinez and Fred McGrff were honorary	catchers.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- The Los Angeles Angels have been able to stay out of long losing streaks since John Lackey joined the rotation in 2002.	The two-time defending AL West champions needed a well-pitched game after Sunday's nine-run loss to the New York Yankees. And they got one Monday night from Lackey, who held the Texas Rangers to four hits over seven innings of a 5-2 victory.	"He's just been a big-time pitcher for us," center fielder Darin Erstad said. "He just has something inside him where he rises to the occasion, and you can't teach that. It's hard to put your finger on what it is, but I like it."	Lackey (1-1) shrugged off a two-run homer by cleanup batter Phil Nevin in the first inning and retired 12 of his last 13 batters. He struck out eight and walked one. The lanky right-hander, who was born in Abilene, Texas, and makes his offseason home in Dallas, is 6-6 against the Rangers with a 5.15 ERA.	"They've got a lot of guys over there who can swing the bats, and it's definitely a challenge every time you face them," Lackey said. "But I was able to command pretty much all four of my pitches and I was hitting spots."	Scot Shields pitched a hitless eighth inning and Francisco Rodriguez got three outs for his fourth save and 22nd in 22 opportunities, extending his club record.	Texas shortstop Michael Young, last year's AL batting champ, didn't hit a ball out of the infield in three at-bats against Lackey, who recorded five of his 14 wins last season after Angels defeats.	"He was throwing a lot of strikes and getting ahead of us," Young said. "We haven't been swinging the bat like we're capable of the last few games, and he capitalized. He was finishing us off with fastballs, breaking balls, pretty much everything in the strike zone."	Lackey escaped a jam in the fourth by striking out Kevin Mench with a runner at third. Mench, who stranded another teammate at second base in the ninth, hasn't driven in a run in his first 31 at-bats this season. Last year, he had 73 RBI in 150 games -- including five on June 30 against the Angels, when he homered three times.	"Kevin will be fine. He's going to have a big year," Young said. "He's a good hitter. It's just a matter of getting him hot, and sometimes it takes a little longer than you'd like."	Mench isn't the only Rangers batter who is struggling. Laynce Nix went 0-for-3 and is hitless in his first 18 at-bats. Leadoff hitter Brad Wilkerson has struck out 16 times in 36 at-bats this season -- including his first two times up against Lackey. He fanned an average of 153.7 times over the previous four seasons with the Montreal/Washington franchise.	"We have a good group of offensive players and talented guys, so it's just a matter of us getting on the right track," Young said. "Hitting is contagious. Anyone will tell you that, so it's just a matter of everyone getting on the same page, and then we should be able to turn it up a notch at that point."	Chone Figgins drove in the tying run in the second with a triple to right field over Mench's outstretched glove after a walk to Jose Molina. Orlando Cabrera followed with a bloop single against Kameron Loe (0-2), putting Angels ahead to stay.	Cabrera then stole second and scored when Vladimir Guerrero reached out for a pitch about a foot off the ground and looped a single into right-center. Guerrero was 2-for-4 and has hit safely in all 37 career games against Texas, the longest streak by a player against one team since divisional play began in 1969. The six-time All-Star is hitting .438 lifetime against the Rangers with	13 homers and 30 RBI.	"That guy can hit anything," Lackey said. "When he hits the ball hard, it's homers, and when you make [tough] pitches on him, it's broken-bat singles. I mean, he can do everything."	Loe, who has a 7-foot boa constrictor named "Angel," was charged with five runs and nine hits in five innings. Last September, the right-hander was forced out of a start against the Angels when a line drive by Guerrero struck him in the head and caromed to Young for the out.	Game notes	The Angels won the season series last year 15-4. They have beaten the Rangers seven consecutive times, 12 in the last 14 meetings, and eight straight at Anaheim. ... Nix had only 19 hits in his final 102 at-bats last year, and his longest hitless drought	of 2005 was 16 at-bats.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK (AP) -- The other stars come and go from the New York Yankees' clubhouse. Derek Jeter remains.	Jeter's three-run homer capped a five-run rally in the eighth inning and the Yankees beat the Kansas City Royals 9-7 on Tuesday to win their club-record ninth straight home opener.	New York wasted a 4-1 fourth-inning lead and trailed 7-4 in the eighth, when it loaded the bases against Andrew Sisco (0-1) on a single wrapped around two walks. Robinson Cano hit an RBI groundout and Bernie Williams punched a run-scoring single to left.	That brought up Johnny Damon, playing his first game in pinstripes. Ambiorix Burgos relieved and struck him out, but Jeter sent the next pitch soaring into the left-field seats.	Scott Proctor (1-1) pitched one inning for the win, and Mariano Rivera finished for his first save.	"The season doesn't officially start 'til you get this one out of the way," Jeter said. "Fortunately, we were able to sneak this one out."	Rivera hit Mike Sweeney on the hand with a pitch in the ninth, forcing the designated hitter from the game and putting two runners on with one out. But the right-hander struck out Reggie Sanders and caught Doug Mientkiewicz's soft looper for the final out.	Kansas City lost its 12th straight at Yankee Stadium dating to August 2002. Sanders and Shane Costa homered for the Royals, who couldn't overcome nine walks.	Jason Giambi hit a three-run homer in the first inning off struggling Joe Mays, and Damon jump-started New York's early offense with an opposite-field double and a walk in his first two plate appearances.	With Kansas City trailing, Sanders homered off Chien-Ming Wang	in a three-run fourth and Angel Berroa grounded into a go-ahead double play after the Royals put their first three runners on in the sixth.	Tanyon Sturtze relieved Wang starting the seventh, and Costa sent his first pitch into the first row of the right-field seats for a 6-4 lead. Mark Grudzielanek doubled and, one out later, Sanders hit an RBI single off Alex Rodriguez's glove at third.	Mays walked five in 2 2/3 innings, throwing 31-of-59 pitches for balls. Mike Wood came in and escaped a bases-loaded jam when Jorge Posada hit a squibber that the reliever picked up and threw to first.	Hall of Famer Yogi Berra threw out the ceremonial first pitch and Reggie Jackson was on hand, but Bob Sheppard's distinctive voice was missing from the home opener for the first time since 1950. The public address announcer, who started with the Yankees in 1951, threw out his left hip Monday night at his Long Island home. He will miss the three-game series against the Royals and hopes to be back April 21.	Giambi had been 3-for-18 (.167) with no extra-base hits before his first-inning homer, which landed in the right-field bleachers and earned him a curtain call from the sellout crowd of 54,698, which included mayor Michael Bloomberg, who watched from a front-row seat.	Mark Teahen had an RBI double in the second, but Mays walked four in the third, including Hideki Matsui with the bases loaded. In Matsui's first home game with the Yankees, he hit a grand slam off Mays in 2003.	Following Sanders' homer, Berroa and John Buck hit run-scoring singles.	Game notes	There was a moment of silence before the game for Maggie Dixon, the Army women's basketball coach who died last week at age 28. ... Former Yankees catcher John Flaherty, who retired with Boston during spring training, started as a pregame and postgame announcer for the YES Network. ... The Yankees won eight straight home openers from 1920-27.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- No brawls, beanballs or even brushbacks Tuesday between the Nationals and Mets.	No sellout and no bouncing stands, either, at Washington's home opener, which was much more low-key in just about every way than last season, when big-league baseball returned after a 34-year absence to plenty of fanfare.	The announced crowd of 40,530 -- more than 5,000 shy of capacity -- didn't have much reason to root, root, root for the home team. Rookie Brian Bannister shut down Washington's struggling offense again for his first major-league victory and Carlos Beltran	homered off the facing of the upper deck, leading the Mets past the Nationals 7-1.	"This is a team that is built to win," said Bannister, whose father, Floyd, pitched in the majors. "I knew my role was to come in here and to lay low, to just eat up innings, to pitch any game they needed me to pitch and to just give this team a chance to win every time. It wasn't to come in here and take over the show."	But he did precisely that Tuesday, giving up three hits without a walk over seven innings. The lone run he allowed was on Alfonso Soriano's homer in the seventh; last week in New York, the right-hander held the Nationals hitless for 5 1/3 innings in his big-league debut.	During that series at Shea Stadium, seven batters were hit -- six by Mets pitchers -- and a near-fight ensued. Nationals right-hander Felix Rodriguez and manager Frank Robinson were suspended by Major League Baseball; before Tuesday's game, Robinson said, both managers were told umpires would watch all season for any sign of trouble when the NL East rivals meet.	"It was basically a warning: They have control of the game. It's up to them. It's what they feel about a certain pitch, and they don't have to wait to put in a warning," Robinson said.	"Word is, there's bad blood between the two ballclubs, and every time we play they're going to put out a warning to the umpires."	Players played down the possible tension before the game, though Bannister (1-0) acknowledged afterward it was on his mind.	"At the beginning of the game, I was a little timid throwing inside," he said. "Especially with Soriano, we did pitch away. As I got more comfortable, we started going back in."	No batter had to dive out of the way of an up-and-in heater. The only person who appeared to get nicked by a ball was plate umpire Brian O'Nora, when a foul tip bounced up and hit him below his mask.	There was one prominently displayed reminder of the shenanigans at Shea. Someone ripped a page out of a New York tabloid with the headline "Old Brawl Game" and attached it to the greaseboard outside the Nationals' clubhouse. Written below, in blue marker and all capital letters: "Strap it on!"	More interesting, perhaps, will be Wednesday, when Pedro Martinez starts. He hit three Nationals with pitches last week, including Jose Guillen twice. Since that game, Guillen is 3-for-18, including 0-for-4 on Tuesday, and his struggles are emblematic of an offense that has totaled eight runs in three games, all losses.	"He's trying to do a little too much right now," Robinson said.	That might be the case up and down Washington's lineup.	While Bannister was in control throughout, Nationals starter Ramon Ortiz (0-2) found himself in trouble repeatedly, giving up four runs and eight hits in six innings. The Mets outhit Washington 12-3, and even Bannister got his first major-league hit -- two,	actually.	Ortiz "gave up the first two [runs], and it's almost like we're out of the ballgame, the way our offense is going," Robinson said.	Aaron Heilman and Billy Wagner each threw a hitless inning in relief for New York, which improved to 5-1. Wagner walked three and loaded the bases in the ninth but struck out rookie Ryan Zimmerman	to escape.	Washington fell to 2-6, and the Nationals' first home game of their second season since leaving Montreal was definitely diminished.	A year ago, there was a sellout. There were large patches of empty seats Tuesday when vice president Dick Cheney emerged to mainly boos and scattered applause for the ceremonial first pitch. Last season, it was President Bush who did the honors. Last year,	commissioner Bud Selig was at the game; this year, baseball's No. 2 official, Bob DuPuy, was in attendance.	"It would have been more exciting," Zimmerman said, "if we would have won."	Game notes	Mets third baseman David Wright has at least one RBI in each of the Mets' first six games, a club record to start a season. ...	Nationals second baseman Jose Vidro went 0-for-4. He had at least one hit in all seven prior games.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

BOSTON (AP) -- After throwing 36 pitches and walking home a run in his first inning at Fenway Park, Josh Beckett was looking at a short outing and a short honeymoon with the Boston fans.	"It's not exactly the first impression you want to make," he said Tuesday.	But Beckett settled down in Boston's home opener and held Toronto to three hits over seven innings, combining with fellow Florida castoff Mike Lowell to beat the Blue Jays 5-3 and give the Red Sox their fifth consecutive victory.	"He wanted to destroy the dugout after that first inning," said Lowell, who went 4-for-4 with three doubles. "But the way he threw, to be down one run after that inning, I'd take that."	Boston took advantage of the Marlins' latest salary purge to acquire Beckett in the offseason. But the Red Sox also had to take Lowell and his $9 million salary and hope that he bounced back from the worst season of his career.	For one game, Lowell was far more than a throw-in.	"Any time you're in a new situation, a new team, I think it's only natural" to want to make a good impression, he said.	Does he think he did?	"I hope so," he said with a laugh. "If I need to go more than 4-for-4, I'm in trouble."	A year after an epic ceremony to celebrate their first World Series title in 86 years, the Red Sox held a more downscale event. In addition to the usual fighter jet flyover and ceremonial first pitch, the team asked for a moment of silence in memory of longtime broadcaster Curt Gowdy.	Fenway was sold out, as it had been for the previous 226 games.	"Coming from Florida, Opening Day is sometimes the only day you have like that," Beckett said.	The fiery right-hander allowed one run in his Red Sox debut last week to win at Texas and start Boston's winning streak. His Fenway premiere started poorly but turned out just as good.	Beckett (2-0) walked three in the first inning -- along with Vernon Wells' single to left -- before falling behind Shea Hillenbrand 3-1 and the bases still loaded. Hillenbrand moved toward first on a pitch that was called strike two, irking Beckett, and then hit into a double play to end the inning.	He didn't throw more than 15 pitches in any of the next six innings. In the sixth, he needed just five.	"I felt like we let him off the hook," Blue Jays outfielder Frank Catalanotto said. "To his credit, he settled down."	Beckett walked four and struck out two, getting a cushion when Lowell, Adam Stern and Kevin Youkilis all doubled in the four-run second. David Ortiz homered in the seventh, a solo shot into the right-field corner for his second of the year.	Josh Towers (0-2) gave up four runs on eight hits and three walks, striking out three in six innings. Catalanotto hit a two-run homer in the eighth, a long drive that went off substitute outfielder Wily Mo Pena's glove and into the Toronto bullpen.	Jonathan Papelbon pitched a perfect ninth for his fourth save.	Beckett also gave up a double to Aaron Hill in the third, when Trot Nixon fell while diving, and Bengie Molina's single in the seventh.	Nixon left after three innings with a mild left groin strain and said he would be out five to seven days. Pena entered the game as his replacement.	Game notes	Toronto right-hander A.J. Burnett allowed two runs and six hits over four innings in his last rehab start for Class-A Dunedin. He struck out four and retired 10 of the last 12 batters he faced. Burnett is scheduled to pitch Saturday against the White Sox. ... Blue Jays right-hander Roy Halladay was supposed to go Saturday, but he will miss his next turn with a forearm injury, general manager J.P. Ricciardi said. ... Boston College and Patriots quarterback Doug Flutie was at the game. ... The Red Sox completed an odd 4-6-3 double play to end the fourth: Mark Loretta leaped to catch Molina's liner, but the ball went off his glove toward shortstop Alex Gonzalez, who picked it up, stepped on second and threw to first.

CHICAGO (AP) -- Here's what Bronson Arroyo has shown the Cincinnati Reds since joining them less than a month ago: He can beat the Chicago Cubs and he can hit home runs off Glendon Rusch.	Arroyo, with no homers in his first six major-league seasons, hit his second off Rusch in six days Tuesday, one of six long balls by the Reds as they routed the Cubs 9-2 on a windy day at Wrigley Field.	"I got lucky again. Just keep hacking," Arroyo said after throwing seven shutout innings and hitting a ball over the left-field bleachers that landed on Waveland Avenue.	"I really just couldn't believe where the pitch was because it was almost identical to last time. ... I was a little surprised," he added. "I knew the wind was going out, I got it good like I did last time. I figured that it wasn't going to land anywhere in the park."	Adam Dunn hit a pair of solo shots and Ken Griffey Jr. and Arroyo had one each off Rusch in the first four innings. Edwin Encarnacion hit his first career grand slam and Austin Kearns	followed with another homer, both off Will Ohman in the sixth.	"He's got more homers than Wily Mo already," Dunn said of Arroyo, who was traded from the Red Sox on March 20 for Wily Mo Pena.	"He's got a good swing. That's impressive. He's shown me two tools so far," he said.	Arroyo, who hit his first homer since high school off Rusch on April 5 at Great American Ball Park, connected for the Reds' third of the game leading off the third. Arroyo's homer last week was his first hit since 2001.	"I don't have anything for you," Rusch said, unable to explain how he could give up two homers to the same previously light-hitting pitcher in less than a week. "He took two pitches and hit them good. Other than that there is nothing I can say."	Arroyo (2-0) also pitched well in beating Chicago for the second time in two starts, an outing made easier by all the run support. He shut down the Cubs and ended their three-game winning streak, allowing six hits.	"Luckily for us we just got more balls in the air than they did," Arroyo said. "These guys can do enough damage on their own but I guess if I can help out the cause, I'll keep doing it. If the wind is blowing out, we have a team that can put up some runs. That gives confidence to the starting pitching."	Derrek Lee, who just signed a $65 million, five-year contract, doubled in Chicago's first run in the eighth off reliever Chris Hammond. Michael Barrett homered in the ninth.	With the wind blowing out at 17 mph, Griffey connected on a long solo shot off Rusch in the first, his second of the season and 538th of his career. Dunn hit an even longer one in the second, a drive to center. He connected again in the fourth.	"It's the first time I've seen four solo homers in the first four innings," Cubs manager Dusty Baker said.	Rusch (0-2) also yielded two homers last week to the Reds in an 8-6 loss. He gave up five hits, four of them homers, and four runs in five innings.	"If the elements play that much into effect as today, look at the way Arroyo threw the ball. He threw seven shutout innings on the same mound and same field as I did," Rusch said. "I didn't make good pitches."	Ohman didn't either. He couldn't get a batter out in the sixth.	Leading 4-0, the Reds loaded the bases when Cubs third baseman Aramis Ramirez and shortstop Ronny Cedeno had a mix-up and let Griffey's wind-blown pop fall for a single in short left, Rich Aurilia singled and Dunn walked. Encarnacion followed with his grand slam and Kearns hit the Reds' fifth solo shot of the day as the boos poured down.	Game notes	Cubs right-hander Mark Prior, working his way back from a strained shoulder muscle that landed him on the DL, threw about 30 pitches from the bullpen mound before the game. Pitching coach Larry	Rothschild said Prior has progressed to a point where he doesn't feel any pain. He will throw again Friday in Arizona. ... Before his homer last week in Cincinnati, Arroyo was 4-for-55 career with 33 strikeouts. He finished 1-for-3 on Tuesday. ... It was the most homers allowed by a Cubs pitching staff since giving up seven to the Astros on Sept. 9, 2000, in a 14-4 loss at Wrigley. ... Chicago right fielder Jacque Jones left in the sixth with a strained right hamstring and had an MRI. Trainer Mark O'Neal said he didn't expect the injury to be serious. Ramirez hurt a muscle in his buttocks on a swing late in the game. ... Dunn has 16 career two-homer games.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.
