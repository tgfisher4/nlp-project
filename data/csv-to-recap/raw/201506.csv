CINCINNATI --  The Reds lost another one of their top players, with the All-Star Game only a month away.	Ivan De Jesus Jr. homered for the second time in three games, and the Reds swept the Philadelphia Phillies with a 5-2 victory on Wednesday after shortstop Zack Cozart injured a knee.	Cozart twisted his right ankle and knee as he tried to beat out a grounder in the first inning. He crumpled to the ground, rolled on his back and grabbed the knee, wincing in pain. He didn't put any weight on the right leg as he was helped off the field and taken for an MRI.	The team didn't have the test results as it headed for a four-game series against the Cubs in Chicago.	"It's safe to say he'll be going on the DL," manager Bryan Price said. "It's heartbreaking is what it is, to see him come off the field like that. Certainly, you don't want to see that at any time, but he was having a phenomenal year."	Cozart's injury overshadowed the Reds' first sweep of Philadelphia since 2013. He's among the NL's top shortstops in numerous offensive categories. Cozart had homered in three of his last four games, leaving him with nine homers and 28 RBI.	He's also the Reds' second-leading candidate for the All-Star Game that will be played in Cincinnati. Only third baseman Todd Frazier has gotten more fan votes.	"It's terrible, especially since he was tearing it up and playing Gold Glove defense," Frazier said. "It's really a shame. He had a great shot at making (the All-Star Game). I feel for him."	Cincinnati already was missing catcher Devin Mesoraco, left fielder Marlon Byrd and starter Homer Bailey due to significant injuries.	The Phillies fell to 7-23 away from Citizens Bank Park, their worst road record after 30 games since 1941. They have lost seven straight on the road -- their worst such slump in two years -- and have been swept three times in their last five series.	De Jesus, a 28-year-old utility player, hit his first career homer in the series opener, a tiebreaking two-run shot for a 6-4 win. His three-run homer on Wednesday off Jerome Williams (3-6) made it 4-0 in the first inning, the Reds' sixth homer in two games.	Jon Moscot (1-1) got his first win in his second major league start. The 23-year-old right-hander gave up two runs and six hits in six innings. Aroldis Chapman retired the side in the ninth for his 12th save in 13 chances.	Brayan Pena singled four times and drove in a pair of runs. Joey Votto singled in four at-bats a day after his three-homer game.	STREAKS	Frazier extended his hitting streak to five games (12 for 22). He has four doubles and a homer during the streak. ... Pena's four hits matched his career high. He also had four hits against Cleveland in 2012.	NICE GRAB	Frazier reached over the railing in front of of the Phillies' dugout to make a backhand catch of Odubel Herrera's foul in the first inning, with Pena grabbing his legs to prevent him from falling in.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: Third baseman Maikel Franco fouled a ball off his right foot during his first at-bat and was in a lot of pain. He walked it off, remained in the game, and singled in his last at-bat, extending his hitting streak to nine games.	Reds: Second baseman Brandon Phillips is day-to-day with a strained groin, injured in a slide into third base on Tuesday night. Center fielder Billy Hamilton was out of the lineup for the second day with a sore left hand.	UP NEXT	Phillies: Following a day off, Philadelphia opens a series in Pittsburgh. Kevin Correia, who signed on Monday, makes his Phillies debut.	Reds: Michael Lorenzen (1-1) opens a four-game series at Wrigley Field, looking for his first win since May 5.	---	Follow Joe Kay on Twitter: http://twitter.com/apjoekay	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

TORONTO --  A power surge and an unexpected pitching gem lifted the streaking Toronto Blue Jays their eighth straight win.	Justin Smoak hit one of four Blue Jays homers, Scott Copeland won in his first major league start and Toronto beat the Miami Marlins 7-2 Wednesday to extend its winning streak to eight.	Blue Jays manager John Gibbons called Copeland's performance "unbelievable."	"I don't see how you can do it better than that," Gibbons said. "He definitely opened up everybody's eyes."	Copeland (1-0), a 27-year-old right-hander who made his big league debut in relief on May 2, started in place of Aaron Sanchez, who was skipped because of general soreness. Copeland allowed one run and six hits in seven innings, struck out four and walked none.	"All the hard work finally paid off," Copeland said. "Hopefully I can stay up here and keep it going."	Still, Toronto optioned Copeland back to Triple-A Buffalo after game.	Josh Donaldson, Russell Martin and Jose Reyes also homered for the Blue Jays (31-30), who moved above .500 for the first time since May 19 (16-15). Toronto is on its longest winning run since a nine-game streak from May 20-28 last year.	"They're as good a hitting club as we've faced," Marlins manager Dan Jennings said.	Smoak and Martin hit consecutive homers in the fourth off Tom Koehler (4-4), who allowed six runs and eight hits in 6 2/3 innings and lost for the first time since May 6 at Washington.	"I didn't keep it in the ballpark today," Koehler said. "It's tough to win a game when you give up three homers, no matter who you're facing."	Reyes and Donaldson hit back-to-back drives in the seventh off Koehler and Sam Dyson. The Blue Jays have hit consecutive homers three times this season.	Toronto has outscored opponents 57-21 during its current streak.	"They punish the ball," Jennings said.	Miami was swept for the sixth time this season. The Marlins have lost four of five and, at 24-36, matched a season worst by falling 12 games under .500.	"You've got to put this behind you and get back to winning series," Marlins catcher Jeff Mathis said.	Martin hit an RBI single and Kevin Pillar added a sacrifice fly as Toronto took a 2-0 lead in the second. Smoak hit a two-run homer off the facing of the third deck and Martin followed with ninth homer to make it 5-0 in the fourth.	Ichiro Suzuki tripled home a run in the fifth, but the Blue Jays chased Koehler in the seventh when Reyes hit his second homer. Donaldson followed with his 17th. Miami's Marcell Ozuna hit a solo homer off Brett Cecil in the ninth.	STANTON SLIDES DOWN A SPOT	Giancarlo Stanton batted cleanup for the first time this season in a bid to spark Miami's offense. "Just trying to get some more guys on in front of Giancarlo, as hot as he is right now" Jennings said. Stanton, who homered twice Tuesday, went 1 for 4 with a single. The top three hitters in Miami's order finished 1 for 12 with four strikeouts.	ROSTER SHUFFLE	The Blue Jays assigned LHP Andrew Albers outright to Triple-A Buffalo. Toronto is expected to promote an infielder before Friday's game at Boston.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: RHP Mat Latos (left knee) will be activated off the 15-day DL Saturday to pitch against Colorado. Latos last pitched May 21 against Arizona. He'll take the rotation spot of Brad Hand, who didn't make it out of the first inning Monday, giving up six runs and six hits.	Blue Jays: Dioner Navarro pinch hit for Edwin Encarnacion in the eighth after Encarnacion's sore left shoulder flared up on him. "We don't think it's a big deal," said Gibbons. Encarnacion sat out Sunday and Monday after getting a cortisone shot. Toronto is off Thursday. ... Sanchez's next start is scheduled for June 16 at the New York Mets.	UP NEXT	Marlins: Miami returns home Thursday to begin a four-game series against Colorado. RHP David Phelps (2-3) starts for the Marlins, his second straight start against the Rockies. Phelps allowed season-highs of nine runs and 11 hits in his previous starts, June 6 at Coors Field.	Blue Jays: Toronto is off Thursday before a three-game series at Boston starts Friday. RHP Drew Hutchison (5-1) faces RHP Joe Kelly (2-4) in the opener. Hutchison walked a season-high five and allowed six runs in four innings in an April 28 start at Fenway Park, but Toronto won 11-8.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

NEW YORK --  Denard Span decided during warmpus that the tightness in his back was tolerable and he would give playing a shot.	He felt a whole lot better when he was running out the go-ahead, infield single in the 11th inning.	Scratched from the lineup the previous night because of his back, Span had three hits and two RBI in the Washington Nationals' 5-4 victory Wednesday that ended the New York Yankees' seven-game winning streak.	"Get on my horses. We need a win, and we're ready to get on an airplane," Span said. "So I just dug deep and tried to get to first."	Span's hustle helped the banged-up Nationals win for only the third time in 12 games.	After the game, Yankees manager Joe Girardi said closer Andrew Miller will go on the disabled list because of a strained forearm muscle, an injury that pushes setup man Dellin Betances into a ninth-inning role.	Miller won't pick up a ball for 10 to 14 days.	"I think it was one of those things that was building," Miller said. "It hasn't been recovering quite like I wanted it to, so it's frustrating more than anything for me."	Michael Taylor hit a tying, two-run homer in the eighth against 22-year-old fellow rookie Jacob Lindgren.	Tyler Moore led off the 11th with a single off Chris Capuano (0-4) and advanced on Jose Lobaton's sacrifice and Danny Espinosa's tapper back to the mound. Span then hit a high chopper up the middle. Second baseman Stephen Drew fielded the ball as he crossed second base but Span beat the one-hop throw.	"That's not an easy transition you want on your first day back," manager Matt Williams said. "We need him. He's an important part of our club."	Blake Treinen (2-2) pitched two scoreless innings for the win, and Drew Storen was perfect in the 11th for his 19th save, tying St. Louis' Trevor Rosenthal for the NL lead.	Alex Rodriguez had a tiebreaking double to end a 0-for-11 drought in a four-run seventh that put New York up 4-2. Brendan Ryan, who came off the 60-day disabled list, had a one-out RBI triple to chase Gio Gonzalez after 6 1/3 sharp innings.	Brett Gardner's RBI double off Felipe Rivero tied the score 2-all, and Rodriguez and Brian McCann had run-scoring hits off Aaron Barrett. McCann's single bounced off second base and over a perfectly positioned fielder.	After Yunel Escobar singled to open the eighth, Girardi replaced Nathan Eovaldi with Lindgren, the first pitcher Harper ever faced in professional baseball who was younger than the Washington star. Harper, who made his major league debut as a 19-year-old and is 7 months older than Lindgren, flied out to left.	Lindgren then got a forceout before Taylor homered the opposite way to right field.	"Just trying to put the barrel on the ball," Taylor said. "In a situation like that it's easy to try to do too much."	No. 9 batter Espinosa doubled with two outs in the third for Washington's first hit and scored on Span's double. Espinosa homered in the fifth for a two-run lead.	Eovaldi, remained winless in interleague play -- he's 0-4 in 12 career starts. He yielded three runs and eight hits in seven-plus innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: RHP Ivan Nova (Tommy John surgery) was at Yankee Stadium before the game to throw a bullpen. He'll next make a rehab start for Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on Saturday. Girardi said Nova should be able to throw 85-90 pitches. ... CF Jacoby Ellsbury (sprained knee) will make the road trip with New York then remain in Florida after the two-game series in Miami that ends Tuesday. Girardi said Ellsbury, on DL since May 20 will not play in rehab games "right away."	UP NEXT	Nationals: RHP Tanner Roark (2-2) faces the Brewers in Milwaukee and Matt Garza (4-7). Roark is 2-0 with a 3.78 ERA since moving back into the rotation. He was 15-10 as a starter last year.	Yankees: After an off day, the Yankees open a three-game series at Baltimore. RHP Michael Pineda (7-2) is set to start after his last turn in the rotation was skipped in order to manage his innings this year.	LATE MOVE	Following the game, the Yankees optioned infielder Jose Pirela to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.	ROAD READY	Harper went 1 for 4 and has reached base in 29 of the Nationals' 30 road games this year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DENVER --  Next to his fastball in the mid-90s, Carlos Martinez's best attribute on the mound is his ability to listen.	Whatever catcher Yadier Molina tells him to throw, he obeys. Simple as that. No head shaking or second guessing.	Martinez pitched efficiently into the seventh inning for a fifth straight start and Randal Grichuk hit a solo homer, helping the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Colorado Rockies 4-2 on Wednesday to avoid a series sweep.	"I was listening to Yadier," Martinez said through a translator. "I believed in what Yadier was calling."	Martinez (7-2) had a shutout until Ben Paulsen's two-run homer in the seventh. That's about the only mistake he made. But even that 88 mph changeup wasn't really a mistake. He thought he made a good pitch -- just not at Coors Field.	"I didn't expect the ball to fly that far," Martinez said.	The right-handed Martinez gave up eight hits in 6 1/3 innings and tied a career-high with two singles at the plate, including one in which he beat out a throw and signaled safe to let everyone know. Martinez also scored a run.	"Carlos was terrific," Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said. "You can tell he's pitching with a lot of confidence."	His performance helped the Cardinals salvage the final game of what's been a rough series. St. Louis was outscored 15-6 in the opening two games and had slugger Matt Holliday go on the disabled list with a strained right quadriceps.	Chad Bettis (2-1) felt "out of whack" all day, never really settling into a comfortable rhythm. He allowed three runs in five innings as the Rockies finished a 5-5 homestand.	"Just felt a little rushed through my delivery throughout the whole game," Bettis explained. "Other than that, just got to keep the ball down."	Paulsen entered as a defensive replacement in the seventh for left fielder Brandon Barnes, who appeared to hurt a leg on a slide into second. Paulsen knew a changeup was coming -- he had seen a steady diet of them -- and hit it into the left-center seats to make it a 3-2 game.	Grichuk gave the Cardinals a little more cushion with a solo shot in the eighth.	Kevin Siegrist pitched 1 2/3 innings and struck out four, including the side in the eighth. Trevor Rosenthal threw a perfect ninth for his NL-leading 20th save in 21 chances.	Colorado was trying for its first sweep of the Cardinals since July 2010 but couldn't solve Martinez as he pitched his way out of jams. Colorado hit into inning-ending double plays in the fifth and sixth innings.	Martinez received some nifty glove work from second baseman Kolten Wong in the first with two outs and DJ LeMahieu on third. Wong made a diving snare in the outfield grass, got up and threw out Carlos Gonzalez by a step.	Martinez tapped gloves with his second baseman on the way into the dugout.	"That's a big play," Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. "A lot of game left, but it's a big play."	TAKEN OUT	Daniel Descalso ran over Wong, his former teammate in St. Louis, while trying to break up a double play in the seventh.	"I thought I taught him better than that -- to get out of the way," Descalso said, smiling. "Guess not."	SLUMP OVER	Matt Carpenter was 0 for 14 before an RBI single in the third. He finished with two hits.	"You have to have a short memory," Carpenter said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: Matheny said the team will monitor the progress of Holliday's strained right quadriceps over the next few weeks. "He's impressive how he's able to bounce back, how his body handles certain injuries," Matheny said. ... RHP Lance Lynn went back to St. Louis for more tests after experience forearm tightness after his last start. Matheny said the team is still waiting to hear back. Lynn is slated to pitch Saturday.	Rockies: OF Corey Dickerson (plantar fasciitis) is to accompany the team to Miami and could come off the disabled list sometime during the series. Dickerson said his left foot "feels a lot better." ... Shortstop Troy Tulowitzki was given the day off to rest.	UP NEXT	Cardinals: The team has a day off after finishing up their road swing 4-3. LHP Jaime Garcia (1-3, 2.67) will take the mound Friday as the Cardinals host the Kansas City Royals.	Rockies: LHP Chris Rusin (2-0, 1.45) throws Thursday to start a four-game series in Miami.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

BALTIMORE --  If the Orioles choose to open a campaign to get Adam Jones a fifth Gold Glove, they will almost certainly break out film of his most recent performance against the Boston Red Sox.	Jones threw out a runner from center field and made two exceptional catches, part of a solid defensive effort that carried Baltimore to a 5-2 victory Wednesday night.	In the second inning, the Red Sox had two runners thrown out trying to stretch hits and Jones concluded the display with a fine running grab in right center.	Jones showed his fielding prowess again in the fifth, racing to his left to track down a liner by Mookie Betts before making a diving catch at full extension.	"It can be a real momentum swing against another team when you center some balls up and they stay in the park and you still get outs," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.	The Orioles won the AL East last year with solid pitching, timely hitting and an air-tight defense. The third facet of that formula is no less significant than the first two.	"We have been one of the top defensive teams in baseball the last few years, so it's of the utmost importance," Jones said.	J.J. Hardy had two RBI for the Orioles, who will attempt to complete a three-game sweep on Thursday night. Baltimore is 6-3 against Boston this season, 4-1 at home.	Wei-Yin Chen (2-4) allowed two runs and seven hits in five-plus innings. The left-hander had only one win in his 11 previous starts despite carrying a solid 3.18 ERA.	In this one, the Baltimore defense gave him all the backing he needed.	"I can only say that it wasn't one of my best days," Chen said through an interpreter. "My teammates played fantastic defense behind me, like Jonesy's plays."	Darren O'Day struck out four during two perfect innings to earn his second save.	Dustin Pedroia had two hits and scored twice for the last-place Red Sox, who have lost nine of their last 10 road games. David Ortiz did not play, mostly because of his .114 batting average against left-handed pitchers.	Boston got its runs in the third and sixth innings. On each occasion, the Orioles answered in the bottom half.	"They did a great job defensively to cut down a couple of guys at second base," manager John Farrell said, "but still, any time we mounted a little bit of an offensive threat, they bounced back."	Rick Porcello (4-6) gave up five runs and 10 hits over 5 1/3 innings in losing his fourth straight start. In three appearances against Baltimore this year, he's 0-2 with a 9.37 ERA.	The tone of the game was set in the second inning. Xander Bogaerts hit a liner off the wall that Jones snagged with his bare hand before throwing out the runner at second base. Pablo Sandoval followed with a single to left and was thrown out at second by Travis Snider. Jones then made a nice running catch of a liner by Betts.	In the Baltimore half, pull-hitter Chris Davis beat the shift with a bunt down the third-base line. Hardy followed with an RBI double and scored on a single by Ryan Flaherty.	After Brock Holt got Boston to 2-1 with an RBI double in the third, Jones responded with a run-scoring single in the bottom half.	Pedroia doubled and scored in the sixth before Baltimore used an RBI single by Snider and a sacrifice fly by Hardy to chase Porcello.	"To me the entire game came down to the sixth inning," Porcello said. "We got a run to cut (the deficit) down to one, then I couldn't put up a zero."	HOT BATS	Red Sox: Bogaerts extended his hitting streak to six games. He has now hit safely in nine of his last 10 games, batting .444 during that stretch.	Orioles: Manny Machado has hits in 34 of his last 45 games. He has had an on-base percentage of .349 and a slugging percentage of .508 over that span.	TRAINERS ROOM	Red Sox: RHP Justin Masterson (shoulder tendinitis) allowed one run and two hits over six innings in a rehab start for Triple-A Pawtucket.	Orioles: RHP Miguel Gonzalez appears headed to the DL with a right groin strain.	ON DECK	Red Sox: LHP Wade Miley starts Thursday night in the series finale. He's 0-1 with a 9.64 ERA in two career starts against Baltimore.	Orioles: Chris Tillman takes the mound as Baltimore seeks its first series sweep of the season.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PITTSBURGH -- Charlie Morton is not a complicated guy. When his sinker is working, the Pittsburgh Pirates right-hander is effective. When it's not, his night tends to end shortly after it begins.	It's been that way for most of Morton's uneven eight-year career. Finally healthy and mechanically sound after an injury shortened 2014, Morton's favorite pitch is finding the strike zone consistently. The results have quickly followed suit.	Morton scattered three hits in 7 1/3 innings to remain unbeaten in his return from hip surgery as the Pirates beat the Milwaukee Brewers 2-0 on Wednesday night.	Morton (4-0) struck out six and walked three to win his fourth straight start since coming off the disabled list last month and fifth straight dating back to his final start of 2014. He didn't allow a hit until Aramis Ramirez led off the fifth with a single up the middle as Pittsburgh salvaged the final game of the series against the last-place Brewers.	"I don't think we're scuffling I just think we caught a couple tough ones," Morton said. "I felt like I went out and did my job and minimized damage and limited their offense. I don't feel like the guy or anything. I feel like I just went out and did my job."	Heady stuff for a guy who spent most of 2014 pitching through a series of problems that weren't corrected until he underwent hip surgery in September. He needed extra time out of spring training to rebuild his delivery but dazzled in three minor league starts and the momentum has continued to build for a team looking for stability at the back end of its starting rotation.	"I think early in games that I am thinking about things a little bit because I want to make sure I get in a groove mechanically," Morton said. "I want to get things straight. As the game goes on, you just get more competitive and that takes over."	Morton's only spot of trouble came in the eighth when a walk and a single put runners on first and second with one out. Reliever Tony Watson needed just two pitches to produce an inning-ending double play and Mark Melancon worked a perfect ninth for his 19th save.	Pedro Alvarez hit his 10th homer of the season. Jordy Mercer and Jung Ho Kang added three hits apiece for the Pirates. Melancon has converted a career-best 17 straight save opportunities after a sluggish start.	Kyle Lohse (3-7) dropped his third consecutive decision while falling to 0-3 against Pittsburgh this season. He gave up an RBI single to Starling Marte in the first and a 438-foot homer to Alvarez leading off the second.	"Personally that was grinding," Lohse said. "That was what I do when I'm not on my best stuff. Basically just changeup and just try not to get hurt with guys on base with anything else. Those are things I need to get back to and it'll get easier when I have all my pitches working."	BRAUN EXITS	Milwaukee right fielder Ryan Braun went 0 for 2 before leaving in the top of the sixth with dizziness. Brewers manager Craig Counsell said Braun was dealing with fluid in his ear and is "day to day."	"He was just light-headed, really light-headed so I don't think it's anything serious," Counsell said. "He couldn't continue."	DANFORTH TRIBUTE	The Pirates held a moment of silence before the game following the passing of former club CEO Douglas Danforth, who died on Tuesday at age 92 following a brief illness. Danforth helped form a public-private ownership group that helped keep the team in Pittsburgh after the Galbreath family put the club up for sale. He served as the team's chairman of the board from 1987-92.	"I will forever owe him a debt of gratitude," Pirates owner Bob Nutting said in a statement. "The Pirates likely would not exist in Pittsburgh had it not been for his leadership and influence."	UP NEXT	Brewers: Begin a six-game homestand on Thursday when they start a four-game set with Washington. Matt Garza (4-7, 5.09 ERA) is 0-3 with a 7.33 ERA in six career starts against the Nationals. Tanner Roark (2-2, 3.16) pitches for Washington.	Pirates: Off Thursday before hosting Philadelphia for three games starting on Friday. The teams split a four-game series in Philadelphia last month. Jeff Locke (3-3, 5.37 ERA) starts for Pittsburgh on Friday against Kevin Correia. Correia, who signed with the Phillies on Monday, went 24-22 with the Pirates in 2011-12 and made the 2011 NL All-Star team.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DETROIT --  Chris Coghlan, Miguel Montero and the Chicago Cubs slugged their way to an easy win over Detroit -- and an impressive finish to a challenging road trip.	Coghlan and Montero each hit a three-run homer, and the Cubs routed the Tigers 12-3 on Wednesday night. Chicago went 5-4 on its trip, which also included a four-game series at Washington. The Cubs have played 11 of their past 14 games against teams that made the playoffs last year -- Chicago went 6-5 in those matchups.	"I think it was a successful road trip overall," said right-hander Jake Arrieta, the beneficiary of all that run support Wednesday. "Regardless of struggle, or end on a high note with a victory, we're able to put it behind us and come out ready to play the next day, focused on the task at hand. That's why we're able to win against good teams."	Arrieta (6-4) shut out the Tigers until Yoenis Cespedes hit a three-run shot of his own in the sixth. The Cubs led 6-0 before that, and Chicago added six more runs in the seventh.	Shane Greene (4-6) allowed five runs and seven hits in three innings, another poor outing for the right-hander who looked so sharp at the beginning of the season. Greene gave up one earned run over his first three starts for the Tigers. Since then, he's posted an 8.60 ERA.	Detroit manager Brad Ausmus would not discuss whether Greene will take his next turn in the rotation.	"I wouldn't talk about any decisions if there were a decision to be made," Ausmus said. "I think he's struggling."	Arrieta gave up three runs and eight hits in six innings. He struck out eight and walked one.	The Cubs wasted a leadoff triple by Dexter Fowler in the first. But Addison Russell opened the scoring with an RBI single in the second, and Chicago added four runs in the third. Coghlan's eighth homer of the season made it 4-0, and Chris Denorfia added a run-scoring single.	Detroit center fielder Anthony Gose made an error on Denorfia's single in the fifth, allowing Mike Baxter to score from first to make it 6-0.	The Tigers missed a chance to cut into the lead after they loaded the bases with one out in the fifth. James McCann fouled out to shallow right field, and Jose Iglesias struck out.	Cespedes connected for his ninth homer an inning later.	McCann, Detroit's catcher, made a terrific diving catch near his team's dugout when Denorfia popped up a bunt in foul territory in the seventh -- but that was the only highlight of that inning for the Tigers. Fowler drew a bases-loaded walk from Tom Gorzelanny, and Anthony Rizzo followed with a two-run single.	Montero's three-run homer off Al Alburquerque made it 12-3.	PRICE'S FUTURE	Detroit ace David Price can become a free agent after this season, and he played for Cubs manager Joe Maddon when the two were with Tampa Bay. Will their relationship matter when the star left-hander is considering potential destinations?	"I don't know," Maddon said. "David and I are friends. I've often said in the past he's probably one of the best teammates I've ever been around. This is something that there's a process that has to be worked out. I just wish him the best with it."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: Maddon said the Cubs haven't discussed a date for a possible rehab assignment for OF Jorge Soler, who is on the DL with a left ankle sprain.	Tigers: RHP Justin Verlander spoke before Wednesday's game. The Tigers plan to give Verlander his first start of the season Saturday against Cleveland. He's been out with a triceps strain.	"I've worked as hard as I can and gotten back about as soon as I can," he said. "I'm just excited to get back out there."	UP NEXT	Cubs: Host Cincinnati on Thursday night. Chicago LHP Tsuyoshi Wada (0-1) faces Michael Lorenzen (1-1).	Tigers: After an off day Thursday, Detroit hosts Cleveland. Price (5-2) faces Danny Salazar (6-1) on Friday night.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CLEVELAND --  Kyle Seager certainly looked like a cleanup hitter Wednesday night, but he has no interest in the job on a permanent basis.	Seager, batting fourth in place of ailing Nelson Cruz, hit a grand slam and drove in five runs to lead the Seattle Mariners past the Cleveland Indians 9-3 Wednesday night.	Cruz, who leads the American League with 18 home runs, missed the game because of back spasms.	Seager helped Seattle win for the second straight day at Progressive Field after a 2-9 homestand. He connected in the third inning against Trevor Bauer (5-3) and added an RBI double in the seventh.	Despite his results, Seager wants to see one of the league's most productive hitters back in the lineup.	"It doesn't feel good to step in Nelson Cruz's spot," he said. "I don't want to step in his spot. I want him to be in his spot. It feels good to get the win for the day, but you have to hope he's back as soon as possible."	Taijuan Walker (3-6) allowed one run in six innings and beat the Indians for the second time in two weeks.	Cleveland lost its third straight and fell to 11-18 at home.	The Mariners scored more than three runs for the first time since May 26, a span of a club-record 13 games. Manager Lloyd McClendon said before the series opener he thought the offense was close to turning things around, but admitted getting four runs on one swing was nice to see.	"Obviously, it made me relax a little bit," he said.	Bauer created his own trouble by walking the bases loaded in the third. Mike Zunino, batting .166, drew a leadoff walk before Austin Jackson and Robinson Cano walked with two away.	Pitching coach Mickey Callaway visited the mound, but Seager drove a 1-1 pitch to right-center.	"With the bases loaded he has to come at you a little bit more," said Seager, who is batting .433 (26 for 60) in 15 career games at Progressive Field. "You try to be aggressive. It was a pitch I could handle."	Indians manager Terry Francona wasn't pleased with the inning and said, "The walks obviously hurt, especially when you load the bases."	Bauer walked Seth Smith before retiring Mark Trumbo to finally end the 38-pitch inning.	Logan Morrison extended his hitting streak to a career-high 16 games with a two-run double in the Mariners' fourth.	Walker, who struck out six, pitched eight shutout innings against the Indians on May 29 at Safeco Field.	Bauer gave up six runs, walked five and struck out five in 3 2/3 innings.	GETTING BACK	RHP Fernando Rodney pitched the ninth, his first appearance since Friday when he was taken out of the closer's role. He gave up a single and double to start the inning, but retired the next three hitters, allowing one run.	"He was a little better," McClendon said. "I thought he had better finish on the fastball."	Rodney, who led the league with 45 saves last season, will return to the closer's role at some point. Rookie Carson Smith recorded saves Saturday and Tuesday.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: Cruz plans to play in the series finale Thursday. It's likely he'll be the designated hitter. He left Tuesday's game when his back tightened up.	Indians: RHP Josh Tomlin (shoulder surgery) threw a bullpen session. He could begin a rehab assignment by the end of the month.	UP NEXT	Mariners: LHP J.A. Happ, who seeks to extend his nine-start unbeaten streak, is 2-0 in four career appearances against Cleveland. He allowed two runs in five innings in a no-decision on May 31 at Safeco Field.	Indians: RHP Shaun Marcum defeated Seattle on May 30 at Safeco Field, allowing two runs in 5 1/3 innings. He lost for the first time with the Indians on June 5 against Baltimore.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ATLANTA --  Williams Perez is developing a reputation for composure that is unusual for a rookie with only five starts in the major leagues.	Perez allowed only four hits in seven innings, Kelly Johnson returned from the disabled list with three hits and the Atlanta Braves beat the San Diego Padres 4-1 on Wednesday night.	The only run allowed by Perez (2-0) was unearned. Making his fifth start, he matched his longest outing while striking out five and walking two. He has allowed no more than one earned run in four of his five starts.	"The guy has got some moxie," said Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez. "He's got some composure and doesn't rattle."	Added Johnson: "That's the impression people have had since seeing him last year at Double A. I really am a big fan of that guy."	Perez has a 2.78 ERA in seven games, including a 1.80 mark in five starts.	Johnson had an RBI single in the second inning in his return after missing 24 games with a strained right oblique. Cameron Maybin drove in a run with two of Atlanta's 14 hits.	Maybin also had the biggest defensive play of the game in the fifth inning, catching Yonder Alonso's drive in front of the center-field wall after Cory Spangenberg's run-scoring double. Spangenberg had three hits.	"Not too many center fielders make that play, to challenge the wall there in center," Gonzalez said.	Jim Johnson pitched a perfect ninth inning for his third save. Closer Jason Grilli was rested after pitching two straight days.	Johnson's second-inning single off Tyson Ross (3-6) drove in Nick Markakis, who slapped a single to left field to lead off the inning. A.J. Pierzynski, who had an infield hit, scored on Andrelton Simmons' single later in the inning.	Ross allowed three runs on nine hits and two walks in six innings.	"They didn't hit him real hard," said Padres manager Bud Black. "They hit the ball in the right spots again and they strung some hits together."	MR. PRESIDENT	Former President Jimmy Carter and wife, Rosalynn, sat near the Braves' dugout. They live in Georgia.	MELVIN STARTS	Former Braves outfielder Melvin Upton Jr., making his first start since coming off the disabled list Monday, was 0 for 4 and was booed before every at-bat. He was robbed of a hit in the third on Johnson's diving catch in left field.	GYORKO DEMOTED	Before the game, the Padres optioned second baseman Jedd Gyorko to Triple-A El Paso and recalled right-hander Nick Vincent. Gyorko was hitting .210 with two homers and 11 RBI and lost his starting job to Spangenberg.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: Black said after the game Wil Myers will come off the 15-day DL and start in center field Thursday. Myers has been out since May 11 with left wrist tendinitis. Myers is hitting .291 with five homers, 19 RBI and three stolen bases.	Braves: To clear a spot for Johnson, OF Joey Terdoslavich was optioned to Triple-A Gwinnett one day after his pinch-hit homer gave Atlanta the lead in its 6-5 win over the Padres. Gonzalez said Terdoslavich "took it really well" and can help the team off the bench later in the season.	UP NEXT	Padres: RHP Andrew Cashner, who gave up eight hits and seven runs in his last start at Cincinnati, will try to get on track against the Braves in Thursday's final game of the four-game series. Cashner (2-8) has allowed a combined 12 earned runs in his last two starts.	Braves: RHP Julio Teheran (4-2) will look for his first win since May 21. He has a loss and two no-decisions while allowing a combined 15 earned runs in his last three starts.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

NEW YORK -- San Francisco Giants manager Bruce Bochy knew that in order for his team to beat Matt Harvey, the top of the lineup needed to produce. And produce it did.	Nori Aoki and Joe Panik combined to go 7-for-10 with a homer, four runs and two RBIs as the Giants roughed up Harvey and defeated the New York Mets 8-5 on Wednesday night.	Aoki matched a career high with four hits, and Panik had a two-run homer in the first inning -- on an 0-2 pitch.	"Those two really got us going," Bochy said. "Panik can do all the little things, and Nori is such a tough leadoff hitter."	Brandon Belt hit one of San Francisco's three homers off a struggling Harvey, and the Giants scored five times in the sixth -- the most runs Harvey has allowed in one inning.	Buster Posey had three RBIs, including a two-run double off Harvey that tied the score in the sixth. Belt followed with a two-run shot, and Justin Maxwell added a long homer later in the inning to give San Francisco a 7-4 lead.	The offensive display was in support of Tim Hudson (4-5), who allowed eight hits as he pitched into the sixth inning. With the victory, Hudson has alternated wins and losses over his past seven decisions.	"They picked me up against a really good pitcher," Hudson said. "It was kind of a grind for me most of the night. I was a little out of sorts."	One night after rookie teammate Chris Heston threw a no-hitter, Hudson didn't have the same magic on the mound against the Mets.	After Panik's home run gave the Giants an early lead, New York tied the game, scoring a pair of runs on three first-inning hits, punctuated by Wilmer Flores' two-run single off Hudson.	"I definitely got the no-hitter conversation out of the way in the first," Hudson said with a smile. "There definitely wasn't any drama from that area like there was last night."	Panik led off the sixth with a single. Angel Pagan followed with a walk and, after falling behind 0-2, Posey calmly stroked a fastball into right for the tying double.	Posey came into the game batting .368 against Harvey.	Belt then drove a changeup the other way to left-center for his eighth homer of the year, putting the Giants ahead 6-4.	"In my second at-bat, I got a swinging bunt off [a changeup]," Belt said. "So I figured he'd throw it again, so I stayed back on it just enough."	Brandon Crawford was thrown out at third trying to stretch a double, and Matt Duffy flied out before Maxwell teed off for a shot to left.	Harvey (6-4) gave up seven runs for the second time in four starts, matching his career high. He walked two and struck out a career-low two in six innings.	The star right-hander, who missed last season while recovering from Tommy John surgery, has allowed 18 earned runs over his past 18 innings. He fell to 15-1 when the Mets score at least four runs for him.	"Everything was all over the place," Harvey said. "Just a pretty poor performance trying to keep a lead that we had. I'm just not doing my job very well."	Santiago Casilla closed for his 18th save in 21 opportunities.	Juan Lagares hit an RBI triple in the eighth, and Eric Campbell and Lucas Duda had RBI singles for the Mets, who have dropped four of five.	Flores led off the sixth with a double, chasing Hudson. But George Kontos struck out catcher Travis d'Arnaud, activated from the disabled list before the game, and retired Lagares on a grounder. Campbell struck out to end the threat.	After missing 46 games with a broken pinkie, d'Arnaud doubled and scored twice in his return to the lineup.	Posey added an RBI single off Hansel Robles in the ninth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Giants: OF Gregor Blanco was placed on the seven-day concussion disabled list. The team recalled OF Jarrett Parker from Triple-A Sacramento. ... The Giants remained without All-Star outfielder Hunter Pence (wrist), who could be headed to the DL.	Mets: To make room for d'Arnaud, the Mets optioned infielder Danny Muno to Triple-A Las Vegas. ... Rookie C Kevin Plawecki (dizziness) was scheduled to undergo tests.	STREAKS	Panik extended his hitting streak to a career-best 14 games. ... Duda snapped an 0-for-16 skid.	ROAD WARRIORS	The Giants improved their road record to a National League-best 18-12.	UP NEXT	Giants: Tim Lincecum (6-3, 3.29 ERA) has won his past six decisions against the Mets and is 2-0 with a 1.50 ERA in three career starts at Citi Field. He'll pitch Thursday night in the series finale.	Mets: Jonathon Niese (3-6, 4.43) has lost his past four decisions and is 1-3 in seven career games against the Giants, six starts, with a 2.98 ERA. Niese has never matched up against Lincecum.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Tampa Bay has found success with pitching, defense and just enough clutch hitting.	Evan Longoria homered and Erasmo Ramirez got help from four relievers in pitching the Rays past the Los Angeles Angels 4-2 on Wednesday night.	"To win games and be the type of team that we want to be, we've got to do that more times than not for sure," Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash said. "Rarely are we going to make many mistakes and get away with it."	Longoria, who started at third base after being held out of the lineup the previous three games due to a sore left wrist, put the Rays up 3-2 with a solo homer in the third inning off Jered Weaver (4-6). It was just his second home run in his last 28 games, and sixth this season.	Ramirez (5-2) gave up two runs and five hits over five innings in winning for the fifth time in six starts. Steve Geltz, Kevin Jepsen, Brad Boxberger and Jake McGee, who pitched the ninth for his first save, held the Angels to two hits over the final four innings.	Tampa Bay has gone 8-3 in its last 11 games despite averaging 3.6 runs.	Weaver allowed four runs and eight hits over 7 2/3 innings in falling to 4-1 in six starts at Tropicana Field.	"He gave us a chance to win and unfortunately we couldn't get much offense going," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.	Los Angeles has lost six of seven.	Asdrubal Cabrera made it 4-2 with an RBI double in the eighth.	Kevin Kiermaier had a run-scoring single in the Rays' two-run second. Nick Franklin scored the other run when third baseman Kyle Kubitza, playing in his first major league game, decided not to throw to first base on Joey Butler's two-out grounder and instead forced Kiermaier to retreat back to second, where he was thrown out.	"It was a little unusual," Cash said. "I think K.K. being on second, busting it toward third, probably got in the guy's eye. Just got caught in-between. A lot of good things on that play."	Kubitza called it a bad play on his part.	"As soon as I threw it to second I thought to myself I don't know what I'm doing," he said. "I should have thrown to first."	Kubitza did have two hits in three at-bats.	The Angels tied it at 2 in the third on consecutive RBI singles by Erick Aybar and Mike Trout.	Kiermaier made a diving catch in center field on Albert Pujols' liner in the eighth. Pujols went 0 for 3 despite hitting the ball hard all three times.	Tampa Bay has held opponents to no more than two runs in 30 of 60 games this season.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: 3B David Freese, who left late in Tuesday night's 8-2 win over the Rays, struck out as a pinch-hitter in the ninth. Scioscia hopes Freese might be able to play defense in a few days.	Rays: OF Desmond Jennings had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee and is expected to miss eight weeks.	RISING RAMIREZ	Ramirez had gone 25 winless appearances, including 15 starts, before his current stretch of success. His ERA has dropped from 25.31 to 4.96.	UP NEXT	Angels RHP Garrett Richards (5-4), scheduled to start Thursday night, is coming off an outing Saturday in which he allowed a season-high six earned runs over two-thirds of an inning to the New York Yankees. He will face Rays RHP Alex Colome (3-2).	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CHICAGO --  Jose Quintana usually doesn't get a lot of run support but the White Sox gave him enough on Wednesday night.	Geovany Soto hit a tiebreaking home run in the seventh inning, leading Quintana and the Chicago White Sox over Houston 4-1 and handing the Astros their seventh straight loss. Quintana (3-6) earned his first win since May 13, allowing one run and six hits in seven innings, and finally got some help from his teammates.	Entering Wednesday, Quintana was getting 2.67 runs of support per game from the Chicago offense. He got more with home runs from Soto, Jose Abreu and Adam LaRoche in completing the sweep of the Astros.	David Robertson got his 13th save in 16 tries.	Soto's home run came off Tony Sipp (2-3). Abreu added a two-run shot in the eighth off Pat Neshek.	"It feels good. Every time you wait for that," Quintana said. "But first you have to deliver a good outing and after that you wait for the support. Tonight we had a pretty good night."	The Chicago offense usually doesn't when Quintana's pitching, though the left-hander has impressed his manager and teammates with how he's dealt with so little support.	"He just comes in and puts his head down and works hard," Chicago manager Robin Ventura said.	Despite a strong night from Vincent Velasquez and five hits from George Springer, the Astros are still waiting for their work to pay off.	Springer went 5 for 5 for AL West-leading Houston and Velasquez made his major league debut, pitching three-hit ball for five scoreless innings.	Velasquez struck out five, walked four and threw 89 pitches. The 23-year-old righty exited with a 1-0 lead, but LaRoche tied the game in the sixth with his homer off Will Harris.	"I was really looking forward and I was really relaxed and I settled in just fine," Velasquez said.	Velasquez was recalled from Double-A Corpus Christi earlier Wednesday, and his debut was the second for a highly touted Houston prospect in three days, following Carlos Correa's first game Monday. Correa, who had driven in Houston's only three runs of the series before Wednesday, was 1 for 4.	Besides Springer, Houston batters did little. They had only seven hits and scored two runs or fewer for the sixth time in their seven losses.	"I thought we swung the bats better than the scoreboard indicated but it really doesn't account for much," Astros manager A.J. Hinch said.	It didn't because of Quintana, and what his teammates gave him.	"I don't know how to explain why for us it's difficult for us to produce runs when he's pitching," Abreu said through a translator, "but today we did it."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: RHP Scott Feldman (right knee) has started to play catch and is starting to move around a little bit as part of a rehabilitation program after undergoing surgery for a torn medial meniscus.	White Sox: LHP Dan Jennings (neck) and RHPs Nate Jones (right elbow) and Matt Albers (right pinkie) are still on the disabled list.	UP NEXT	Astros: LHP Brett Oberholzer (0-1, 3.75) faces Seattle RHP Felix Hernandez (9-2, 2.51) on Friday in Houston. Oberholzer is 2-0 with a 1.20 ERA lifetime against Seattle.	White Sox: LHP John Danks (3-5, 5.17) faces the Rays on Friday at Tampa Bay. Danks will be coming off a rough start Saturday against the Tigers, when he gave up five runs over 4 2/3 innings.	GOOD START	Hinch realizes the hype around Correa won't die down soon as he heads into his first look at Hernandez. "All the firsts need to get out of the way before he settles in  -- including facing Cy Young caliber pitchers," Hinch said. Correa has also faced LHPs Chris Sale and Carlos Rodon.	FAMILY OBLIGATIONS	Ventura will miss this weekend's series against Tampa Bay to attend the college graduation of his daughter, Madison. Bench coach Mark Parent will replace Ventura, and minor-league hitting coordinator Vance Law will serve as bench coach.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MINNEAPOLIS -- The Kansas City Royals reclaimed first place with a resounding three-game sweep on the road of division rival Minnesota.	The Twins were beaten so soundly, well, they lost their shirt.	One of them, at least.	Alex Gordon hit a three-run homer, Edinson Volquez struck out six batters over seven innings and the Kansas City Royals beat the Twins 7-2 on Wednesday, a night spiced up in the eighth inning by an ejection of Torii Hunter that prompted an equipment-throwing tantrum by the Minnesota star.	"You know what he's trying to do. He's trying to fire everybody up and get `em going," Kansas City manager Ned Yost said. "They've been in a little slow bat period themselves, and he's trying to get everybody fired up and get `em going. It's a bit entertaining."	Hunter was heaved by home plate umpire Mark Ripperger for arguing a called third strike. Hunter had to be restrained briefly, before yanking off his elbow pad, shin guard and batting gloves and throwing them around the batter's box area.	Then Hunter ripped off his jersey and hurled that over the first-base line, before retreating to the dugout.	"We have bad days, all of us, as hitters, pitchers. Even umpires have bad days, and he had one," Hunter said.	Hunter has long been a fiery player, but his blow-up likely wouldn't have happened had the Twins not been swept at home for the first time this season. Manager Paul Molitor was given his first career ejection during the conflict, too.	Was that satisfying to see for the Royals, who arrived at Target Field on Monday trailing the Twins by one game in the American League Central?	"No, I find satisfaction in winning baseball games. To get out of town sweeping the series, it's a good feeling," Yost said.	The Twins scored 11 runs while stumbling to a 1-5 record on this home-stand. They hadn't been swept since the opening series of the season at Detroit.	Volquez (5-4) pitched the Royals to victory by reaching the seven-inning mark for only the second time in his last nine starts. He scattered seven singles, walking two.	"With our pitching staff, the way they've done it the past three games makes our offense feel comfortable even though we're not scoring a lot of runs," Gordon said.	The Royals went 2-9 over an 11-game stretch until Sunday. Now they've won four in a row.	"You're going to have slumps throughout the season. It's how you respond to it," Gordon said. "We kept our heads up. It was frustrating at times, but we knew we were going to get out of it and play some better baseball, and that's what we're doing now."	Kyle Gibson (4-4) found a groove after Gordon's big hit, finishing six innings with six strikeouts while allowing five hits and two walks, but he had little help. Plouffe, whose triple in the seventh was Minnesota's only hit against Chris Young the night before, homered off Luke Hochevar in the eighth.	Gibson had a 2.03 ERA in the five previous starts of his career against the Royals, and he was in command again.	Except for that first inning.	Eric Hosmer's single drove in the first run. With two outs and a full count, Gibson left enough of a changeup over the plate for Gordon to drive it into the right-field seats for a 4-0 lead. The Royals stretched their lead with two of their three unearned runs in the seventh against J.R. Graham, including an RBI single by Mike Moustakas.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Kansas City: The Royals must decide on Thursday whether to keep Drew Butera or return Aaron Kratz as catcher Salvador Perez's backup, when Kratz's rehabilitation assignment for a foot injury expires.	Minnesota: Shortstop Jorge Polanco went 1 for 3 with a walk in his season debut and was charged with one of three errors by the Twins. He was returned to Double-A Chattanooga after the game. Outfielder Eddie Rosario is expected from paternity leave on Friday.	UP NEXT	Kansas City: The Royals start a three-game intrastate, interleague series against St. Louis after a day off. Yordano Ventura (3-5, 4.62 ERA) will pitch for the Royals on Friday, opposite Jaime Garcia (1-3, 2.67 ERA) of the Cardinals.	Minnesota: After an off day, the Twins travel to Texas for a three-game series. Tommy Milone (2-1, 4.55 ERA) will start on Friday for the Twins against fellow Wandy Rodriguez (3-2, 3.25 ERA) of the Rangers.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  For one night in a rough season, Sam Fuld and the Oakland Athletics enjoyed some of that old walkoff magic that used to define this club.	Fuld slid into home to just beat the throw for the winning run with one out in the ninth on Josh Reddick's grounder, and the A's snapped a four-game losing streak with a 5-4 victory against the Texas Rangers on Wednesday night.	"We used to specialize in those here for quite a while," manager Bob Melvin said. "It was nice to be able to come back from 4-2 to tie it, then come back and score another run. It was a good feeling."	Reddick received one of those celebratory whipped cream pies in the face he has regularly doled out in recent years.	"We were long overdue for a walkoff," Fuld said. "Those are the best kinds of wins. Good teams get a lot of walkoff wins, and we were definitely in desperate need of one."	Fuld was overdue for a hit, period.	He hit a one-out single off Keone Kela (4-3) for just his eighth hit in 80 at-bats and stole second. Fuld advanced on Billy Burns' infield single and shortstop Elvis Andrus held the ball rather than throwing to third.	Reddick followed with a sharp grounder that second baseman Adam Rosales fielded and threw home just barely too late. It marked Reddick's fifth career game-ending RBI.	Oakland's comeback spoiled a 10-strikeout night by Texas starter Yovani Gallardo.	"It got a little tough for us. We put ourselves in a couple of tight spots," Rangers manager Jeff Banister said. "We ran into some outs on the bases, we got picked off, we missed a cutoff. It wasn't the cleanest game but it was still one I thought we had a chance to win. More than anything, it was missed opportunities to add on."	Billy Butler hit a tying single off Tanner Scheppers in the eighth after Oakland scored another run on third baseman Joey Gallo's throwing error.	Tyler Clippard (1-3) pitched a perfect ninth for the win.	Rangers right fielder Shin-Soo Choo caught Max Muncy's deep fly at the wall to end the eighth.	Gallardo overcame a 30-pitch first inning that put him in a 1-0 hole and got stronger late. He struck out the side in order in the sixth to give him four straight Ks. He reached double digit strikeouts for the 19th time in his career and first since Sept. 19 at Pittsburgh.	Mitch Moreland hit a pair of RBI singles as Texas lost for only the 13th time on the road.	A's starter Jesse Hahn lasted just 3 2/3 innings and hit three batters.	Hahn plunked Choo in the right upper back to load the bases with none out in the third. Prince Fielder followed with a sacrifice fly.	Hahn also hit Leonys Martin in the third and Fielder in the fourth. The three hit batsmen matched an Oakland record done eight times previously and first since Barry Zito on April 15, 2005.	Switch-pitcher Pat Venditte relieved after Moreland's fourth-inning single. Throwing left-handed, he struck out Gallo on three pitches.	He pitched two more scoreless innings -- going 1-2-3, right-left-right in the sixth that ended with a strikeout of Fielder.	In the first, the A's challenged that Delino DeShields was safe at first on a pickoff attempt. The call was overturned on review in 50 seconds. DeShields led off the game by reaching on shortstop Marcus Semien's 20th error -- also Oakland's majors-leading 58th error.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: LHP Martin Perez made his first rehab start since Tommy John elbow ligament replacement surgery in spring 2014. He went 2 2/3 innings for Double-A Frisco, allowing five hits and one run with four strikeouts and no walks. ... 1B/OF Kyle Blanks, out following a procedure for a cyst in his tailbone area, could be activated as soon as Thursday.	Athletics: RHP Jarrod Parker visited the A's as he recovers from a fractured elbow following two Tommy John surgeries. ... Reliever Edward Mujica (fractured right thumb) threw on flat ground and is scheduled to pitch a bullpen Thursday.	UP NEXT	Rangers: RHP Chi Chi Gonzalez (2-0, 0.00 ERA with 14 2/3 scoreless innings) pitches the series finale at Oakland looking to become the first pitcher in franchise history to win each of his first three major league starts. Gonzalez has already joined Glen Cook (1985) and Kevin Brown (1986-88) to win his first two outings.	Athletics: LHP Scott Kazmir (2-4) tries for his first win in 10 starts since an April 13 victory at Houston. He is 0-4 with a 4.85 ERA and .299 opponents batting average over his last six outings.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

LOS ANGELES --  Yasiel Puig is back and he's brought his powerful bat with him.	Puig went 4 for 4 with a three-run homer and scored the game-winning run after drawing a walk in the bottom of the ninth inning to help the Los Angeles Dodgers beat Arizona 7-6 Wednesday night for their seventh consecutive victory over the Diamondbacks.	Puig tied a career high for hits on his perfect night at the plate and finished a triple shy of the cycle. He's hit safely in all four games since coming off the disabled list last Saturday, with the Dodgers winning four of five in his return.	"The cycle doesn't matter to me. What I was trying to do is get on base," Puig said through a translator. "Everyone has got to do their job with their at-bats."	Puig missed more than a month with a strained left hamstring that has resulted in him running the bases more carefully.	"I was bored," he said about his time away, and joked: "I wanted to see if they'd put a video game in the dugout for me."	Daniel Hudson (1-2) issued consecutive one-out walks to Puig and Adrian Gonzalez in the ninth before giving up Howie Kendrick's bloop single to right field, allowing the Dodgers to finish a three-game sweep. Kendrick drove in all three Dodgers runs Tuesday night.	"It's tough to fill the shoes of a guy like that when he can do so much," Kendrick said of Puig. "He's got speed and if he's in scoring position, he's going to try to score."	Yasmani Grandal had a solo homer for the Dodgers, who have defeated the Diamondbacks nine straight times at home. The latest win gave Los Angeles three consecutive home series sweeps over Arizona dating to last year.	Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen (1-0) blew a save chance for the first time this season, giving up A.J. Pollock's career high-tying eighth homer leading off the ninth.	"He's a tough at-bat," Pollock said. "Sometimes you overswing against a guy like that because he's a big guy who throws hard. He also throws a cutter, so I think I had a good plan there. I was just fortunate enough to get him over the plate."	Los Angeles' four-run lead was cut to 5-4 on consecutive homers by Paul Goldschmidt, whose two-run shot was his 100th career homer, and Yasmany Tomas in the fifth off starter Brett Anderson. The Diamondbacks have lost four in a row, and seven of their last nine on the road.	"They've got big hearts," Arizona manager Chip Hale said. "They could have easily cashed it in there, down 5-1 and not having a whole lot of success in this ballpark. We hit a lot of balls hard, but the Dodgers made a lot of nice plays to get outs on us. But I think we played our tails off."	Kike Hernandez's sacrifice fly extended the Dodgers' lead to 6-4 in the sixth. Chris Owings hit a sacrifice fly for Arizona in the seventh.	Puig homered in the second on the first pitch from starter Jeremy Hellickson, giving Los Angeles a 4-1 lead.	Grandal hit a high-arcing homer in the third that a fan in the front row of the right-field pavilion caught one-handed, extending the cushion to 5-1.	The Dodgers backed Anderson with some solid defensive plays. Rookie center fielder Joc Pederson got his glove over the wall to rob Tomas of a homer with two runners on in the third. Third baseman Alberto Callaspo backhanded a liner for the final out of the fourth.	Hellickson gave up five runs and six hits in 3 2/3 innings.	STREAKS SNAPPED	The run Jansen allowed ended a streak of eight scoreless innings to start the season and 17 straight innings without permitting a run dating to Sept. 5, 2014. He had converted all seven save chances this year and 12 in a row dating to last season.	GOLDY'S HOMER	Goldschmidt moved into sole possession of sixth place on the Diamondbacks' career home run list, breaking a tie with Matt Williams. Goldschmidt is batting .418 with five doubles, seven homers and 17 RBI in his last 20 games since May 21.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: 3B Justin Turner didn't play for the second straight game after fouling a pitch off his left kneecap in the series opener Monday. He was doing better Wednesday, and will get more rest on the off day Thursday. ... The goal for LF Scott Van Slyke, who hasn't played since May 30 because of a back injury, is to become pain-free in order to begin a minor league rehab assignment. ... Juan Nicasio exited with a cracked nail on his middle finger.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: Chase Anderson (1-1, 3.12 ERA) starts the series opener Friday at San Francisco after an off day Thursday. He has allowed no more than one run in five of his last seven starts. He has never faced the Giants.	Dodgers: Clayton Kershaw (5-3, 3.36) starts the series opener Friday at San Diego after the team's only off day of the month on Thursday. In his last outing against St. Louis, the left-hander allowed one hit in eight scoreless innings to earn his third straight win.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CLEVELAND --  Giovanny Urshela got his first major league hit in the third inning.	He added his first big league home run in the sixth.	Unfortunately, his family did not get to see either milestone.	"They left in the second inning," he said.	The 23-year-old Colombian third baseman made his major league debut Tuesday, and his family stayed in town for three days. But his family had to start heading home and couldn't stay at Progressive Field for the entirety of the Cleveland Indians' 6-0 win over the Seattle Mariners on Thursday.	"It's very exciting, both hits," Urshela said. "I was just trying to get one in one day, and I got two."	Urshela, who backed a two-hitter by Shaun Marcum and a pair of relievers, was called up from Triple-A Columbus when Lonnie Chisenhall was sent down Sunday.	Urshela grounded an RBI single past shortstop Brad Miller in a four-run third, the first batter after Tom Wilhelmsen relieved J.A. Happ (3-2). His home run off Vidal Nuno just cleared the 19-foot fence in left and rebounded onto the field.	Both momentos were retrieved and were in Urshela's locker following the game. Urshela smiled widely as he slapped hands with teammates in the dugout after his home run.	Asked whether he had any special plans for the ball, he responded: "Just keep it forever."	Urshela is 2 for 8 with three RBI in three games.	"You could see how happy he was," Indians manager Terry Francona said. "It was genuine, pure. You don't get to see that all the time. It's once in a lifetime when you get your first major league hit, first major league home run."	Marcum (3-1) retired his first nine batters and already led 5-0 before hitting Logan Morrison on the back of his right leg leading off the fourth. Mark Trumbo grounded a single just out of the reach of Urshela at third and shortstop Mike Aviles with one out in the fifth.	Robinson Cano, hitting .214 since May 9 (25 for 117), doubled to right-center leading off the seventh. The Mariners' final nine batters then made out.	Marcum struck out five and walked none. Zach McAllister and Cody Allen followed with perfect innings for Cleveland, which broke a three-game losing streak.	Seattle (27-33) has lost nine of its last 12 games and scored more than three runs just once in its last 15 games. Nelson Cruz, who leads the AL with 18 home runs, missed his second straight game because of back spasms.	"We didn't do much offensively," Mariners manager Lloyd McClendon said. "We hit some balls hard, but credit goes to Marcum, he kept us off balance. Cutting and sinking and did a nice job."	Happ allowed four runs, six hits and two walks in 2 1/3 innings. Brandon Moss chased him with an RBI single, and Roberto Perez capped the burst with a two-run single.	Zach Walters's RBI single put Cleveland ahead in the second.	Morrison was 0 for 3, ending his career-high hitting streak at 16 games.	Indians second baseman Jason Kipnis didn't start for the first time this season after playing in Cleveland's first 58 games. Kipnis is second in the AL in hitting with a .333 average.	STRONG OUTING	Marcum, making his fifth start since being called up in late May, had his best performance with the Indians.	"It was nice to go out there and be able to locate the ball and take what I've been doing between starts and actually have it happen," he said.	TRAINER'S ROOM:	Mariners: Cruz is expected to return Friday when Seattle opens a three-game series in Houston.	Indians: RHP Scott Atchison (sprained left ankle) is likely to be activated on Friday or Saturday. He threw a scoreless inning in a rehab assignment for Double-A Akron on Wednesday.	UP NEXT	Mariners: RHP Felix Hernandez (9-2), who leads the AL in wins, starts Friday against Houston.	Indians: RHP Danny Salazar (6-1), fourth in the AL with 81 strikeouts, opens a three-game series Friday at Detroit.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ATLANTA -- Padres manager Bud Black said he was pacing the clubhouse "like a caged lion" after getting ejected in the seventh inning of a steamy game that lasted nearly four hours and started 56 minutes late because of rain.	"From the edge of the dugout to the video room to my office to the coaches' room to the kitchen to the training room. You name it," Black said. "I know every little spot in the clubhouse."	Yangervis Solarte hit a two-run single in the 11th inning, and San Diego beat the Atlanta Braves 6-4 Thursday following a benches-clearing incident and Black's ejection.	Players left dugouts in the first after Julio Teheran hit Matt Kemp with a 90 mph fastball. No punches were thrown and no one was ejected.	Black was tossed for arguing with umpires Jordan Baker and Jerry Meals.	Craig Kimbrel, facing his former team for the second time in the series, earned his 15th save in 16 chances with a perfect 11th that included Andrelton Simmons' groundout and strikeouts by Christian Bethancourt and pinch-hitter Jonny Gomes.	San Diego improved to 4-2 in extra-inning games.	"That just shows how good of a team we have," Kemp said. "We have to win those games. That was a good comeback."	Atlanta's struggling bullpen, which began the day with a major league-worst 4.75 ERA, combined with Bethancourt to blow a 4-1 lead during San Diego's three-run eighth.	After a walk loaded the bases with no outs and chased Teheran, Bethancourt's passed ball allowed Solarte, who entered as a pinch-hitter, to score and cut the deficit to 4-2.	Luis Avilan walked Yonder Alonso, forcing in a run. David Aardsman struck out two batters, but Wil Myers scored the tying run when Bethancourt was called for catcher's interference against Cory Spangenberg.	Brandon Cunniff (2-2) walked Derek Norris opening the 11th and allowed Spangenberg's infield single. One out later, Alexi Amarista loaded the bases with a single, and followed with the go-ahead hit.	Dale Thayer (2-0) gave up a hit and walk in 10th.	Baker threw Black out of the game after the Braves went up 3-1 on Jace Peterson's infield RBI single.	Black approached Baker, the home plate umpire, to argue the ball hit Peterson's bat twice before rolling down the first-base line and allowing Simmons to score from third.	Black asked crew chief Jerry Meals to have the umpires convene, but Meals refused. Visibly angry, Black was soon ejected by Baker.	"When there's a foul ball or a ball that looks like it's foul -- in that case a double hit -- the umpires' mechanics are to say it immediately," Black said. "When no one did, the home plate umpire said it wasn't a foul ball. And from my vantage point, I found that hard to believe. And that's all I'm going to say about that."	Cameron Maybin followed with a sacrifice fly that gave the Braves a 4-1 lead and chased starter Andrew Cashner.	Freddie Freeman drove in Atlanta's first two runs. His RBI double in the first tied the score at 1-1 and his 11th homer in the sixth made it 2-1.	Cashner gave up four runs, seven hits and four walks in 6 2/3 innings.	Teheran allowed four runs -- three earned -- four hits and three walks in seven-plus innings.	Kemp went 2 for 14 with an RBI in the series. He declined to comment directly about the incident with Teheran.	"That was a good game, wasn't it?" Kemp said.	Teheran insisted he wasn't throwing at Kemp.	"You don't want nobody to get hit like he was, especially with two strikes," Teheran said. "I was trying to throw the same pitch that I threw before and he was swinging. He got upset, but it's part of the game."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: CF Wil Myers, out the previous 28 games with tendinitis in his left wrist, went 0 for 5 with a walk after being activated from the disabled list. Myers said he'll have the wrist taped for another four weeks, at a minimum.	Braves: Peterson made a pair of sharp defensive plays at second base and is hitting .381 in 21 at-bats since a cortisone shot June 4.	UP NEXT	Padres: RHP Odrisamer Despaigne (3-4) is 0-2 with a 5.84 ERA in two career starts and one relief appearance against the Los Angeles Dodgers.	Braves: LHP Alex Wood (4-3) has a 4.09 ERA and is 0-2 in six starts against the New York Mets. Wood was ejected after five innings for arguing with an umpire in his last start -- a 3-0 loss last Sunday to Pittsburgh.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- Scott Kazmir was pleased with his first win in nearly two months -- and with fastball.	Taking a much more selective approach with his heater, Kazmir looked a lot like the pitcher who won his first two starts.	Kazmir allowed one hit in eight innings to end a nine-start winless streak and lead the Oakland Athletics over the Texas Rangers 7-0 Thursday.	"He didn't get too amped up early in the game and try to force things," A's manager Bob Melvin said. "He just kind of went with the flow, spotted his fastball early on, mixed in all his pitches and really kind of revved it up as he went along."	Kazmir (3-4) retired 13 of his first 14 batters around a second-inning walk by Adam Rosales and didn't allow a hit until Elvis Andrus' one-out single to center in the fifth.	Texas' only other runner was Prince Fielder, who walked leading off the seventh.	"It felt like I was in control out there," said Kazmir, who struck out six. "When I needed to hump up a little bit, I had it there and was able to hit my spot with it. That was the difference. Took a different approach, and it worked."	Kazmir defeated Texas and Houston in his first two starts of the season but had been 0-4 in nine outings since beating the Astros on April 13, although he had a 3.78 ERA in that stretch.	Evan Scribner needed nine pitches in a perfect ninth that completed the one-hitter.	Oakland shortstop Marcus Semien, who leads the majors with 20 errors, snared a liner up the middle from Leonys Martin to end the second. Center fielder Billy Burns made a diving catch to rob Delino DeShields of a potential extra-base hit in the sixth.	Burns also made a leaping one-handed grab before crashing into the fence in center on Carlos Corporan's deep fly to end the eighth.	"That was unbelievable," Kazmir said. "That right there, that gets you going as a pitcher. When someone makes a play like that you just want to go out there and return the favor and get those guys back into the dugout."	Chi Chi Gonzalez (2-1) gave up one run, eight hits and three walks in seven innings. He had entered with 14 2/3 scoreless innings in the major leagues and was trying to become the first Texas pitcher to win his first three big league starts.	"The more he does it, the more we'll expect him to do it," Rangers manager Jeff Banister said. "Any time a rookie comes to the bigs and does this type of stuff, you don't expect three straight starts. We knew he was a good pitcher. and we love what he's done."	Ben Zobrist hit an RBI single in the first. The A's broke open the game in a six-run eighth that included a pair of two-run homers, by Mark Canha off Jon Edwards and Josh Reddick against Ross Detwiler.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: Kyle Blanks (cyst) was activated from the disabled list before the game and batted cleanup for Texas. Blanks went 0-for-3 with two strikeouts. ... RHP Spencer Patton was optioned to Triple-A Round Rock to make room for Blanks. ... LHP Mike Kickham was released by Round Rock. ... Reliever Martin Perez pitched 2 2/3 innings in his first rehab assignment since elbow surgery. The left-hander allowed one run and five hits with four strikeouts.	Athletics: 1B Ike Davis (strained left quadriceps) will begin a rehab assignment with Triple-A Nashville on Friday. ... 2B Eric Sogard (left wrist) was kept out of the starting lineup. ... RHP Edward Mujica (broken thumb) threw a bullpen session without setbacks and could begin a rehab assignment next week.	UP NEXT	Rangers: LHP Wandy Rodriguez (3-2) faces Minnesota in Texas on Friday looking for his first win in four home starts.	Athletics: RHP Jesse Chavez (2-6) starts Friday in Anaheim against the Angels, a team he's beaten just once in four career starts.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BALTIMORE -- The Baltimore Orioles entered this week with the opportunity to change the landscape in the AL East.	After dropping the Boston Red Sox into last place with a three-game sweep, the Orioles shifted their attention toward knocking the New York Yankees out of first.	Adam Jones hit the first of three home runs off Wade Miley, and Baltimore beat Boston 6-5 Thursday night for their season-high fourth straight victory.	Nolan Reimold and Manny Machado also homered for the Orioles, who squeezed out a pair of one-run victories in their first sweep of the season. Baltimore has won six of seven, which may -- or may not -- be a factor when the Yankees come to town Friday for a three-game series.	"We have momentum until we leave the locker room and get back here tomorrow," manager Buck Showalter said.	Machado chose to adopt a more upbeat approach.	"Getting this little roll on, playing good baseball, it's just the main thing as long as you get in a little groove," he said. "It's a long season ahead of us, but hopefully we keep riding this wave."	Miley (5-6) allowed five runs and nine hits over four innings. After finishing the fourth, the left-hander engaged in a heated exchange with manager John Farrell in the dugout. Still screaming, Miley walked into the tunnel with Farrell in pursuit.	"You work four days for your start -- he didn't want to come out of the game. That's his competitive spirit coming through," Farrell said. "I fully respect that. I thought he had good stuff overall, but where we were in the game I thought we needed a change in contrast, change of style, so we made a move."	Miley said: "When you pitch every five days, you get an opportunity (and) you want it to last as long as possible. It stings a little bit, but that's part of the game."	Asked if the two had settled their differences, Miley said, "We're all men in here. I'm competing on my end, he's competing on his end. It's over."	David Ortiz hit his seventh home run and Pablo Sandoval had two RBIs for Boston, which dropped seven games under .500 (27-34) to match its low point of the season.	Although the eighth-inning solo shot by Ortiz went for naught, it ended his run of 69 at-bats without a home run.	Chris Tillman (4-7) gave up four runs in 5 2/3 innings to improve his career record against the Red Sox to 9-3.	After Chaz Roe yielded a solo shot to Ortiz that made it 6-5, Zach Britton worked the ninth for his 17th save.	Baltimore was celebrating the victory when a replay overturned the apparent third out on a close play at first base. Undaunted, Britton struck out Dustin Pedroia to end it.	The Orioles executed several defensive gems on Wednesday night and continued the trend in the first inning of this one. Reimold chased down a liner to make a running catch near the left-field wall, and Machado snared a sharp grounder to third before making the throw from the outfield grass.	Jones hit his 10th home run in the bottom half, and Steve Pearce added an RBI single in the Baltimore second.	Reimold led off the third with his first homer since last August. Jones followed with a double and Delmon Young singled past the drawn-up infield for a 4-0 lead.	Tillman retired the first nine Boston batters before the Red Sox loaded the bases with no outs in the fourth. After Mike Napoli delivered a sacrifice fly, Sandoval doubled in two runs.	Machado connected in the bottom half to make it 5-3.	GOING DEEP	Red Sox: Ortiz's HR was No. 473 of his 17-year career and tied him with Carlos Delgado for 31st place on the career home run list. Ortiz has five homers over his last six games at Camden Yards.	Orioles: Reimold, who was signed to a minor league contract in February, was recalled on Tuesday. The homer was his first as an Oriole since July 10, 2013.

NEW YORK -- Michael Cuddyer and the New York Mets got one big hit after another Thursday night. Quite a contrast from the series opener against San Francisco, when they didn't muster any.	Cuddyer singled home the winning run in the bottom of the ninth inning, and the Mets topped the Giants 5-4 to prevent a three-game sweep and move back into first place in the NL East.	"It's huge morale-wise for us," manager Terry Collins said. "Today was a big one."	Curtis Granderson scored twice and drove in a run to help New York win on a 91-degree night when chants of "Let's go Giants!" rang out at Citi Field. The Mets beat the defending World Series champions for only the second time in 11 meetings, rebounding from a pair of humbling losses to start the series.	San Francisco rookie Chris Heston pitched a no-hitter Tuesday, and Mets ace Matt Harvey was hit hard again the following night. So when New York finally pulled this one out, no wonder it was a relief.	"Hard-fought series. Good road trip," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "You'd like to get greedy and get this one, but we just couldn't hold the lead."	Sergio Romo (0-3) hit Granderson in the back on an 0-2 pitch with one out in the ninth. Granderson advanced to second on Andrew Susac's passed ball and third on Juan Lagares' groundout before Lucas Duda was intentionally walked.	Cuddyer, who had a go-ahead double in the fifth, stroked a sharp single into center field and raised his right arm as he headed for first base, just ahead of the swarm of teammates that chased him down to celebrate.	"It's definitely a good feeling," Cuddyer said. "To get swept at home ... leaves a bad taste in your mouth."	It was Cuddyer's first game-ending hit in nine years.	"I knew it'd been a long time because I don't remember the last one," he said with a smile.	Reminded it was a pinch-hit homer for Minnesota against the Angels on April 19, 2006, he said: "I do remember it then!"	Jeurys Familia (2-0) pitched a scoreless inning for the win.	Mets starter Jonathon Niese went seven innings in his second consecutive encouraging performance. He got 15 outs on the ground after entering 0-4 with a 7.96 ERA in his last five games.	"A good outing to build on. My stuff felt great," Niese said. "My mechanics are more sound."	The left-hander retired 12 in a row before substitute third baseman Eric Campbell committed a two-out error in the sixth. Brandon Crawford followed with his ninth homer, a long drive into the Giants' bullpen in right-center that gave San Francisco a 4-3 lead.	Hunter Strickland gave up three straight Mets hits to the start the seventh, including a leadoff double by pinch-hitter Darrell Ceciliani and Granderson's tying single.	Tim Lincecum held the Mets hitless until Travis d'Arnaud blooped an RBI double with two outs in the fourth. Niese opened the fifth with a double to deep center and scored on Duda's sacrifice fly. Cuddyer put the Mets up 3-2 with a two-out RBI double.	"I felt good all night," Cuddyer said.	Looking to win his seventh straight decision against New York, Lincecum was lifted after 4 2/3 innings.	The first four batters reached safely against Niese, and San Francisco scored on Buster Posey's run-scoring single and Justin Maxwell's double-play grounder.	"A big boost," Niese said. "It could have got out of hand real quick."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Giants: All-Star outfielder Hunter Pence (left wrist tendinitis) missed his seventh straight game and did not take any swings. Bochy said the team will make a decision about putting Pence on the disabled list when it returns home Friday to play Arizona. "Still in a holding pattern with him," Bochy said. A potential replacement from the minors will be ready to meet the club in San Francisco, he said.	Mets: Rookie C Kevin Plawecki (dizziness) saw another doctor and had more tests. "He's just got a real clogged sinus," Collins said. "The pressure of flying has caused him to have some of the headaches and the dizziness. Once we get that cleared up, which they think they can, he'll be a lot better." Now that they have a diagnosis, though, the Mets should be able to option Plawecki to the minors or place him on the disabled list to make room for a backup infielder Friday. ... LHP Jerry Blevins (broken left arm) is healing but is not yet ready to throw. "I think he's pretty much on track," general manager Sandy Alderson said.	HELP WANTED	Niese, who went seven innings, has yielded 11 unearned runs in 12 starts this season. New York has made 13 errors with Niese on the mound, most for any National League team behind one pitcher.	"It is what it is," he said. "It's part of the game."	DENIED	San Francisco was trying for its first sweep of the Mets in New York since May 2002 at Shea Stadium.	UP NEXT	Giants: LHP Madison Bumgarner (7-2) faces Chase Anderson (1-1) and the Diamondbacks on Friday night. San Francisco has lost its last five home games.	Mets: Bartolo Colon (8-4) starts the opener of a three-game series against Alex Wood (4-3) and the Atlanta Braves.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

MIAMI -- Giancarlo Stanton took a mighty swing and topped the ball, which dribbled 40 feet before it came to rest on the third-base foul line for a two-out, run-scoring infield single.	Stanton had a blast to go with his bloop, hitting his 22nd homer and driving in four runs to help the Miami Marlins break a three-game losing streak Thursday night by beating Colorado 6-0.	Stanton, who leads the majors in homers and RBI, said the swinging bunt felt just as good as the homer.	"You've got to rack those up and get your average up," said Stanton, who is batting .249. "Whatever works."	David Phelps (3-3), rocked by the Rockies at Coors Field last week, pitched a career-high eight innings, allowing four hits. Chris Rusin (2-1) gave up 11 hits and six runs in 5 1/3 innings.	Stanton pulled a liner into the Rockies bullpen for a three-run homer in the first inning. He said he knew the ball was gone when he hit it, even though the trajectory was never higher than about 20 feet.	"That's all you need," Stanton said.	It was only his second homer this year with more than one runner on base. He batted cleanup for the second straight game after previously hitting third this season.	Stanton said the change makes no difference to him, but manager Dan Jennings indicated he may stick with the new lineup for a while.	"The whole idea was to get more traffic on in front of `G' and give him run-producing situations," Jennings said.	Stanton enjoys success against the Rockies wherever he bats. In 35 career games against Colorado he has 13 homers and 41 RBI, including his run-scoring dribbler to make the score 5-0 in the second inning.	"It counts like a line drive," Jennings said. "We'll take it. That tells you what happens when you put the ball in play."	Jeff Baker hit his third homer, Christian Yelich drove in a run with his first triple, and Marcell Ozuna singled to extend his hitting streak to 12 games.	Miami shortstop Adeiny Hechavarria, batting leadoff for the first time this year, had three hits, stole a base and scored a run. He also charged a grounder and made an acrobatic throw while airborne and horizontal to rob Nick Hundley of a hit.	The Marlins' big offensive show came without major league batting leader Dee Gordon, who was given the night off. Gordon leads the majors with a .356 average but is batting .255 since May 15.	Phelps struck out six, walked one and threw 111 pitches to improve his chances of staying in the rotation. He gave up nine runs in a loss at Colorado last week.	"I'd like to think I learned what not to do last time out," Phelps said. "I didn't make a whole lot of quality pitches last time. That's what I was really focusing on tonight, and it paid off."	By contrast, Rusin regressed after beating Phelps last week.	"I just didn't hit my spots," Rusin said. "The ball was up this time. The last time I kept the ball down and had movement. Today I didn't."	Miami's Carter Capps struck out two in the ninth to complete a five-hitter.	The Rockies' Corey Dickerson, activated before the game from the disabled list, had two hits in four at-bats. Troy Tulowitzki had a single to extend his hitting streak to 10 games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Barring a setback, Marlins RHP Jarred Cosart (vertigo) will rejoin the rotation early next week. He made a rehab start Thursday for Triple-A New Orleans and gave up two runs in 5 2/3 innings.	ROSTER MOVE	After the game, the Marlins optioned LHP Adam Conley to Triple-A New Orleans. A corresponding move will be made Friday.	UP NEXT	Rockies RHP Kyle Kendrick (2-7), who has the second-worst ERA among major league starters at 6.16, is scheduled to start Friday against Marlins rookie RHP Jose Urena (0-2, 5.49).	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Albert Pujols' home runs these days come with a baseball history lesson.	Pujols hit his 537th home run Thursday night to move ahead of Mickey Mantle into 16th place on the career list, and Mike Trout also homered for the Los Angeles Angels in a 6-2 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays.	Pujols' 17th home run of the season, which came in the ninth inning off Preston Guilmet, was his 1,122nd extra-base hit, tying Manny Ramirez for 14th place in that category. The 35-year-old first baseman has 1,635 RBI, one short of Ernie Banks who is 29th on the all-time list.	"We hear about Mickey Mantle again; (Pujols) tied him and now he's ahead of him," said Angels manager Mike Scioscia. "Every time he hits one, it's fun to follow the names that keep coming into the conversation."	Pujols' homer was his ninth in 13 games.	"I'm catching more breaks, I guess," he said. "I've been swinging the bat well all year long and if you stay with that approach, sooner or later they're going to fall. I'm not going out there and trying to hit a home run every time, just trying to put on a good swing and let the rest take care of itself."	Trout drove in two runs with his 17th home run and a double. The homer, his sixth in 11 games, drove in the Angels' first run off Rays starter Alex Colome. Trout's two-out double off Brad Boxberger drove in another run in the seventh after rookie Kyle Kubitza's single had given Los Angeles its first lead of the game, 3-2.	The Angels had 14 hits in winning for only the second time in eight games.	"We had great at-bats one through nine," said Trout. "It was fun to watch, fun to be a part of it. That's how we need to be every night."	Garrett Richards (6-4) pitched seven innings for the Angels, giving up two runs and four hits while striking out seven.	Former Angel Kevin Jepsen (1-4) took the loss after giving up three runs in the decisive seventh. The Rays' bullpen gave up five runs 3 2/3 innings.	"(We) brought our guys in and it just didn't work out tonight. We'll still take those chances anytime we get them with our bullpen. We have a ton of confidence in them."	Steven Souza Jr.'s 12th home run gave the Rays a 2-0 lead in the second. That score stood until Trout's homer in the sixth.	Colome gave up one run and four hits while striking out four in 5 1/3 innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: 1B C.J. Cron's left hand was sore after being struck by a pitch Wednesday night. He grounded out as a pinch hitter in the ninth.	Rays: LHP Drew Smyly began sock tossing Thursday, the first step in his return from a torn labrum. Smyly is not eligible to come off the DL until July 5 and might miss the rest of the season.	UP NEXT	Angels: LHP Hector Santiago (4-3) will face Oakland in the opener of a five-game homestand Friday night.	Rays: RHP Matt Andriese, called up from the minors last Thursday, will start Friday night's home game against the Chicago White Sox.	RAYS ROSTER MOVES	The Rays optioned Guilmet and designated C Bobby Wilson for assignment after Thursday night's game and placed RHP Andrew Bellatti on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to June 10. They recalled Andriese and LHPs Enny Romero and C.J. Riefenhauser.	DANCIN' WITH A STAR	Singer-actress Paula Abdul made a series of dance moves toward the plate before throwing the ceremonial first pitch. She was at the game as the goodwill ambassador for the Prostate Cancer Foundation.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CHICAGO --  The Chicago Cubs used their power to survive a rough night from their starting pitcher.	Miguel Montero and Dexter Fowler each homered, and the Chicago Cubs ended the banged-up Cincinnati Reds' four-game winning streak with a 6-3 victory Thursday night.	That offensive display was needed to pick up Tsuyoshi Wada. Coming off his worst start with the Cubs, when he allowed five runs in 3 2/3 innings on June 5 in Washington, Wada wasn't much better Thursday. He gave up three runs and four hits in three-plus innings before being replaced by Travis Wood (3-2) following Chris Dominguez's home run to begin the fourth.	"He just needs to become more assertive like he was earlier," Cubs manager Joe Maddon said.	Maddon said Wada needs to simplify during his outings. The Cubs manager also asserted he's not thinking about pulling Wada from the rotation.	When asked if he was concerned about losing his spot, Wada said through a translator it's not his decision but "if you look at this result it could be happening."	With the rebuilt right-field bleachers filled with fans for the first time this season, the Cubs won for the fourth time in five games.	Montero's three-run homer in the first off Michael Lorenzen (1-2) gave Chicago an early lead, and Fowler's third-inning drive put the Cubs in front 4-2. Kris Bryant added an RBI double in the fifth for the Cubs, who got a strong night from their bullpen.	"We've been so much better offensively here the last few weeks, I didn't think that was a hole we couldn't get out of," Reds manager Bryan Price said.	Wood pitched 2 1/3 innings and was one of five Chicago relievers that combined to throw six scoreless innings and in one stretch retire 14 consecutive batters. Hector Rondon, whose status as Chicago's closer has come into doubt, saved his 11th game in 14 attempts.	Dominguez was recalled earlier Thursday from Triple-A Louisville to help the increasingly injured Reds.	Already with a rash of injuries, the Reds were playing their first game without Zack Cozart after the shortstop was ruled out for the season with a torn tendon and two torn ligaments. He was hurt trying to beat out a grounder Wednesday against Philadelphia.	Along with Cozart, the Reds were missing Marlon Byrd (right wrist), Billy Hamilton (left wrist), Devin Mesoraco (hip), and Brandon Phillips (left groin).	To replace Cozart, Eugenio Suarez was recalled from Louisville and went 1 for 3.	Lorenzen went 4 1/3 innings, allowing five hits, six runs -- five earned -- while walking three and striking out six. He also had a two-run triple in the second.	"One thing I was happy about is I didn't step off the gas," Lorenzen said.	The Cubs, meanwhile, would like to see Wada get more aggressive.	"Trusting your stuff, don't try to fool everybody, believe what you're doing," Maddon said, "and I think he'll be much better."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: Price said Phillips is day to day, and that he anticipated seeing Hamilton in the lineup Friday if his workouts went well Thursday. ... Mesoraco played left field but departed from Wednesday's game early during his rehab assignment at Triple-A Louisville due to soreness. Price said the team might have to reevaluate whether he can physically play the outfield.	Cubs: Maddon said he hasn't heard anything new on RHP Neil Ramirez (right shoulder).	UP NEXT	Reds RHP Johnny Cueto (4-4, 2.64 ERA) faces Chicago RHP Jason Hammel (5-2, 2.76). Entering Thursday, Hammel (0.893) and Cueto (0.945) were the top two in the NL in walks and hits per innings pitched.	SORIANO TIME?	Maddon said Rafael Soriano could be coming in a month. "You'd like to think at least post-All-Star break would be probably a reasonable timeframe," he said. Maddon said Soriano, who was signed Tuesday to a minor league deal, is throwing in the Dominican Republic and is waiting for his immigration paperwork to go through before coming to the United States.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

MILWAUKEE --  Scooter Gennett grinned sheepishly at first base following an RBI single in his first game back in the major leagues.	While he didn't hit the ball hard in the bottom of the eighth, his bouncer found just the right spot inside the third-base bag to trickle into left field with two outs. Shane Peterson scored the go-ahead run from third, capping the Milwaukee Brewers' rally from a four-run deficit for a 6-5 victory Thursday night over the Washington Nationals.	Welcome back to the majors, Scooter.	"Obviously it wasn't the hardest-hit ball in the world," Gennett said, "but it got the job done."	Gennett spent 17 games at Triple-A Colorado Springs to work on his swing after opening the season hitting .154 to lose the starting second base job. He hit .307 in the minors.	Gennett's night at the plate didn't start out well with a popout and weak bounceout to the mound. But on the third trip, Gennett hit a fly ball to the warning track in center field.	The fourth at-bat in the eighth proved to be the best of them all.	"You need to have a little fortune once in a while. Sometimes, that's what creates confidence," manager Craig Counsell said. "You're first night back, you get the game-winning hit, that's a big deal."	A throwing error by second baseman Anthony Rendon that allowed Peterson to reach two batters earlier proved costly for reliever Aaron Barrett (3-2).	Following Gennett's hit, Barrett ended up leaving during the middle of an at-bat to Hernan Perez. Frustrated manager Matt Williams didn't have detailed information on his reliever.	"He was uncomfortable," Williams said. "We'll see how he is tomorrow."	It didn't look like Milwaukee would pull out a win after a sloppy start Thursday.	Three Washington runs scored on errors, including two in a three-run fourth following an atypical throwing miscue by third baseman Aramis Ramirez on a two-out bouncer by Rendon for a 5-1 lead.	But the Brewers chipped away over the middle innings, and Gerardo Parra tied the game at 5 with a solo homer to deep right-center with one out in the seventh off starter Tanner Roark.	The Brewers are still in last place in the NL Central, but they have been playing much better of late with five victories in their last seven games.	TABLES TURNED	The Nationals got sloppy late in the game.	The eighth started with Ramirez reaching first on a wild pitch despite striking out. The next batter, Peterson, hit what looked like a sure double-play ball to short, but Rendon's relay throw bounced wide of first to allow Peterson to reach second.	Gennett delivered his RBI single two batters later.	"In the late innings, any mistake is magnified," Williams said. "Late in games, that's going to hurt you."	GOOD WILL	Will Smith (2-0) pitched a scoreless top of the eighth -- ending that inning by picking off Bryce Harper -- for the win in his first appearance since returning from a six-game suspension for being caught with foreign substance on his arm.	"What was it, 1-2, or 0-1 count?" Smith recounted. "Guy is probably expecting breaking ball and takes off, and we guessed right."	Francisco Rodriguez tossed a scoreless ninth for his 13th save in as many opportunities.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: Ryan Zimmerman was placed on the 15-day DL before the game with plantar fasciitis in his left foot, an ailment that affected the first baseman all season. Williams said he thought that Zimmerman would need the minimum time on the DL, though for now he needed "total rest" and to get off his feet for a few days.	Brewers: CF Carlos Gomez (sore legs) missed a second straight game. Counsell said he hoped to get Gomez back on Friday or Saturday. ... RF Ryan Braun had two hits and an RBI triple on Thursday, a day after leaving Wednesday's 2-0 loss to Pittsburgh because of dizziness stemming from a left ear ailment.	UP NEXT	Nationals: Jordan Zimmermann (5-3) is slated to start Friday back in his home state. The right-hander is 2-0 with a 1.50 ERA in three starts against Milwaukee at Miller Park, which is about 180 miles southeast of Zimmermann's hometown of Auburndale.	Brewers: After a tough start to the season, Mike Fiers (2-6) has been effective over his last six starts. He is 1-2 with a 2.78 ERA in that span.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

CHICAGO --  The Cincinnati Reds are finding new ways to keep their surge going.	Eugenio Suarez drove in Todd Frazier with an unearned tiebreaking run in the 10th inning, and banged-up Cincinnati rebounded for a 5-4 victory over the Chicago Cubs for the Reds' fifth win in six games.	Suarez, playing in his second game after being called up for injured shortstop Zack Cozart, singled on a 3-2 pitch through a drawn-in infield off Hector Rondon (3-1) for his first RBI with the Reds.	Frazier was charging in from third two pitches earlier, and Suarez tried to bunt -- a suicide squeeze -- on a 2-1 count. He fouled off the pitch, then worked the count full and swung away.	"We took one shot at it and it was an up and away fastball," manager Bryan Price said. "He did a good job to foul it off. And then came through big time with that base hit on 3-2 to drive in the run."	Suarez, a 23-year-old former Detroit Tiger playing in just his second National League game, was smiling at the outcome.	"The third base coach gave me the sign (squeeze). I tried to put the ball in play," Suarez said. "After that I kept my concentration. I hit a good slider he threw me and I hit it real good. I felt very, very excited because we won a really good game."	Cincinnati's J.J. Hoover (5-0) pitched a scoreless eighth and ninth for the win. Aroldis Chapman struck out two in the 10th for his 13th save in 14 chances	Frazier, who reached in the 10th on third baseman Kris Bryant's throwing error, hit his team-leading 18th homer and had an RBI double. Ivan Dejesus Jr. and Brayan Pena also had RBI in Cincinnati's three-run first inning.	"We've been playing well," Price said. "We've had some tough, tough injuries. "We're just kind of putting our heads down and rolling."	Starlin Castro's two-run homer in the sixth inning tied the score 4-4. Cubs starter Jason Hammel and Addison Russell also had RBI.	Before Rondon came on in the 10th, four Cubs relievers -- Zac Rosscup, James Russell, Jason Motte and Pedro Strop -- combined for four hitless innings while striking out six.	"We made a couple of mistakes, but we kind of fought through them," Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. "We had an absolute chance to win the game.	"If we play that game often enough this year, we're definitely going to get ourselves into the playoffs."	Reds starter Johnny Cueto was sailing along with a 4-2 lead until Castro's homer tied it in the sixth. Cueto finished with nine strikeouts and no walks through seven innings, while allowing four runs.	Hammel allowed four runs -- two earned -- through five innings before leaving after 103 pitches. He permitted seven hits, struck out four, walked three and hit a batter. Hammel had been solid in his previous two starts, winning both while allowing a combined three earned runs and striking out 18 in 14 2/3 innings at Miami and Washington.	"I was out of sync today," Hammel said. "It cost me a lot of deep counts and I battled for five innings."	Fog rolled in and out of soggy, chilly Wrigley Field. Combined with a strong wind blowing in from the north, that made some normally routine plays adventurous.	Russell, Chicago's rookie second baseman, couldn't handle leadoff man Skip Schumaker's routine grounder in the first. That set the stage for Cincinnati's three-run inning when eight men batted.	Dejesus Jr. and Frazier had RBI doubles, and Pena knocked in the third run with a sharp single.	Hamel helped his own cause as the Cubs cut it to 3-2 in the second. His single drove in Chicago's first run with a single, then scored on Russell's double.	Frazier's solo shot leading off the third on an 0-2 pitch made it 4-2.	ON BOARD	The Reds announced they have signed top draft pick Tyler Stephenson, a high school catcher from Georgia selected No. 11 overall Monday night. He will be assigned to rookie-level Billings in the Pioneer League.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: CF Billy Hamilton (sore left hand) was back in the lineup and batted ninth after missing three games. He entered the game leading the majors with 25 stolen bases. ... 2B Brandon Phillips (groin) pinch hit in the eighth after missing three games. ... C Devin Mesoraco, an All-Star last season, will discontinue a rehab assignment at Triple-A Louisville where he was playing left field -- a position the Reds hoped would put less strain on a left hip injury.	Cubs: Maddon said OF Jorge Soler, on the 15-day DL (left ankle sprain), is making progress, although he hasn't resumed baseball activities.	UP NEXT	Cincinnati RHP Mike Leake (3-4, 4.29 ERA) faces Chicago RHP Kyle Hendricks (2-2, 3.96) on Saturday.	CLOSER OR NO CLOSER	Rondon leads the Cubs with 11 saves in 14 chances -- but that's doesn't mean he'll be Chicago's only closer.   And it has nothing to do with his hard-luck loss in the 10th on Friday. Maddon said he might call on other relievers to pitch the ninth and spot Rondon -- or whoever's hottest out the bullpen -- to pitch earlier against the heart of an opponent's order to preserve a lead.	"I like having one (closer), absolutely," Maddon said. "But the nice thing about not having it designated that way is that you get a more clean, clear opportunity to use your best pitcher against the middle of the lineup."	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

BALTIMORE --  The first time the Baltimore Orioles faced Michael Pineda this season, they struck out 16 times in a losing effort.	In the rematch, the Orioles looked as if they were taking batting practice against the New York Yankees' right-hander.	Chris Davis homered and drove in four runs, and Baltimore breezed to an 11-3 victory Friday night to extend their season-best winning streak to five.	Caleb Joseph hit a solo shot and Jimmy Paredes had three singles and two RBI for the Orioles, who reached .500 (30-30) for the first time since May 5. Baltimore has won seven of eight following a five-game skid.	Davis delivered an RBI single in the first inning and a three-run drive in the third, both against Pineda (7-3). The slugger came into the game 1 for 11 with eight strikeouts in his career against the 6-foot-7 hurler.	On May 10 at Yankee Stadium, Pineda reached a career high in strikeouts against Baltimore. In this one, he fanned only two in 4 1/3 rocky innings, allowing six runs, nine hits and two walks.	"He didn't quite have the command he had last time," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. "We were just fortunate to catch him on a little bit of an off night."	Said Davis: "We did our homework. I think the more you see a guy, you know what he's going to do. Tonight he just didn't look as sharp as he was in New York and we were able to take advantage of it."	It was Pineda's shortest outing since being ejected in the second inning on April 23, 2014, for using pine tar on the mound.	"I tried to throw my best pitch in the game today, and the slider was not working very good," he said.	Pineda hadn't pitched since June 1 because the Yankees don't want to overwork him, but he wouldn't blame the extended rest for his subpar performance.	"They tried to take care of me and give me a little rest," Pineda said. "What happened tonight, it happens with everybody."	Mason Williams homered in his major league debut for the first-place Yankees, who have dropped two in a row after winning seven straight.	Ubaldo Jimenez (4-3) gave up three runs in five innings to earn his first win since May 11. Although the right-hander struggled from the outset, he kept the damage to a minimum and received plenty of offensive support.	New York failed to score in the first inning after loading the bases with no outs. Davis singled in a run in the bottom half.	Alex Rodriguez picked up his 1,999th career RBI with a single in the Yankees third, but Baltimore used a run-scoring single by Adam Jones and Davis' 13th home run to go up 5-1.	After striking out in his first at-bat, Williams hit a two-run drive to right in the fourth.	"Pretty speechless," he said. "Honestly it was my first home run of the year. I wish it would've come at a better time in this game."	The former fourth-round draft pick was removed for a pinch hitter after going 1 for 2.	Baltimore pulled away with a four-run sixth that began with Joseph connecting off Jacob Lindgren. Later in the inning, first baseman Mark Teixeira overthrew second base trying for a force play, ending his career-high errorless run at 109 games and providing the Orioles with four unearned runs.	That put Baltimore in double figures in runs for the first time since April 26.	ROSTER MOVE	The Yankees outrighted reliever Esmil Rogers to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre after the game. The right-hander allowed four runs Friday and has a 6.27 ERA.	"I thought he actually threw the ball decently tonight," manager Joe Girardi said. "But it hasn't been consistent work for him and we wanted to try to get him going."	TRAINERS ROOM	Yankees: OF Jacoby Ellsbury (right knee sprain) is running at about 60 percent according to Girardi, who added, "He's starting to do a little bit of everything now."	Orioles:  RHP Kevin Gausman (right shoulder tendinitis) felt no lingering pain after his rehab assignment Thursday night. He is slated to pitch two innings for Single-A Frederick on Tuesday.	ON DECK	Yankees: CC Sabathia starts against the Orioles on Saturday night looking for his 212th career win, which would give him sole possession of 23rd place on the win-list for left-handers.	Orioles: Bud Norris takes the mound for Baltimore. He's 2-4 with an 8.63 ERA this season, but is 4-1 lifetime against New York.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PITTSBURGH --  Just about everyone got to share in this shutout.	Starling Marte's single in the bottom of the 13th drove in Chris Stewart and the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the Philadelphia Phillies 1-0 Friday night.	The Phillies were kept scoreless by seven pitchers, marking the first time since at least 1914 -- as far back as STATS could check -- for that many Pittsburgh relievers to combine on a shutout.	"It was a wonderful game to watch," Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said.	Even if it was one that ended exactly six hours after the scheduled 7:05 p.m. start.	A passing rainstorm delayed its start by 86 minutes and Marte finally ended it  with a two-out chopper up the middle off Dustin McGowan (1-2). Backup catcher Stewart came around from second, beating Ben Revere's throw from center to send the Phillies to their fourth consecutive defeat and move the Pirates into second place in the NL Central.	"I slid into home and I was excited," said Stewart, the Pirates' final available position player who reached via a one-out, pinch-hit single. "I couldn't wait to get out there with Marty and celebrate."	Jeff Locke, Arquimedes Caminero, Tony Watson, Mark Melancon, Jared Hughes, Rob Scahill and Antonio Bastardo (1-1) combined on Pittsburgh's fifth shutout of the season and first that had lasted at least 13 innings at home since Aug. 29, 1914, according to information provided to the Pirates by the Elias Sports Bureau.	"It came down to one hit that found the hole with the man on base," Phillies manager Ryne Sandberg said. "It took a long time to get that, and we came up on the short end."	Philadelphia's first six pitchers combined for 11 scoreless innings, the first 5 2/3 coming from veteran Kevin Correia in his season debut.	Josh Harrison had four hits to match a career high, including Pittsburgh's lone extra-base hit -- a two-out double in the fourth.	A pitcher's duel seemed improbable with the Phillies turning to a starter signed to his third organization in three months earlier this week in Correia.	But Correia and Locke, Pittsburgh's No. 5 starter, combined for 11 2/3 scoreless innings, albeit not without baserunners. Philadelphia left six men on base over the first three innings, and eight of the 17 runners Pittsburgh stranded in the game were put on base by Correia.	The Phillies have lost seven of eight and 17 of 22. Their lineup Friday did not include regulars Chase Utley, Ryan Howard, Freddy Galvis and Carlos Ruiz.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: Pittsburgh hasn't had a player put onto the disabled list since May 6.	STELLAR STARTERS	Pirates starting pitchers are still on quite the wave of success, though a rare streak came to an end Friday. Starters had accounted for each of the past 17 Pittsburgh victories dating to May 11 before reliever Bastardo got the latest win. That was the longest such Pirates streak since 1987. Still, Pittsburgh starters are 14-3 with a 2.30 ERA over the past 20 games.	HOT EMOTIONS	After coming back from down 3-0 in the count and striking out Jordy Mercer with the bases loaded to end the eighth, Phillies reliever Ken Giles drew the ire of Sandberg, Phillies bench coach Larry Bowa and pitching coach Bob McClure. Television cameras caught each one yelling the face of a seated and visibly agitated Giles, who yelled back at times.	"There was some frustration and some game situation. Talked about some game situations," Sandberg said in an apparent attempt to diffuse the situation, adding that it was" taken care of in-house."	Giles did not speak with reporters after the game.	Sandberg was asked if he liked when players showed emotion on the field.	"I do like to have players with emotions. There's a time and a place and a situation to show that."	UP NEXT	Pirates: RHP Gerrit Cole will try to take over the majors' lead in wins with his 10th on Saturday. Cole, who has won each of his past four starts, won in Philadelphia on May 11.	Phillies: RHP Sean O'Sullivan lost against Pittsburgh on May 12 at Citizens Bank Park. C Francisco Cervelli, tops in the NL with a .356 average since May 1, had two doubles in that win for the Pirates.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DETROIT --  David Price didn't allow any runs and Miguel Cabrera drove in the only runs he needed.	Price pitched a seven-hitter for his third career shutout and Cabrera hit a three-run homer and an RBI double in the Detroit Tigers' 4-0 win over the Cleveland Indians on Friday night.	Price (6-2) didn't walk a batter and struck out eight while throwing only 93 pitches.	"Tonight, was very special, absolutely, with the defensive plays I was able to get, from (shortstop Jose) Iglesias, obviously, and (second baseman) Ian Kinsler. Everybody did their part tonight, and it's fantastic," Price said. "To get eight outs on four pitches, that's always huge, and that's always a game-changer."	The Tigers turned four double plays behind Price, when they managed to get someone on.	"Every pitch, fastball, breaking balls, had so much life," Cleveland's Ryan Raburn said about Price. "And it was almost never in the middle of the plate. Just about everything on the corners."	Danny Salazar (6-2) matched Price until the sixth when he gave up Cabrera's homer, which went over the center-field fence and traveled about 450 feet. It was Cabrera's 13th home run and also drove in Anthony Gose and Rajai Davis, who led off with singles. Cabrera homered one out later.	"It's a joke. It's a joke," Detroit third baseman Nick Castellanos said. "I can't hit a ball that far from second base. It's just Miggy being Miggy."	Raburn could only marvel at Cabrera.	"He's impressive, man. To be as good of a hitter as he is, hit balls like that and hit .330 . Man, I tell you what, I'm sure jealous," Raburn said.	Price sees it all of the time.	"He has power to all fields, and he shows it in BP every day. He'll hit a home run to right, then go right-center, center, left-center and left. He'll do it all in five swings, Price said. "Nobody else in baseball, really, contains that power that he has. He's special. "	Salazar allowed the three runs and seven hits while walking one and striking out six. He was replaced by C.C. Lee to begin the eighth.	Cabrera's RBI double in the eighth made it 4-0. His drive into the right center-field gap with one out off Lee scored Ian Kinsler, who singled.	Davis was thrown out at the plate in the first inning to complete an inning-ending double play. With Davis on second and Cabrera at first with one out and Yoenis Cespedes batting, Davis took off for third. Cespedes hit a weak grounder between the mound and the first base line that Salazar fielded and threw Cespedes out at first. Davis continued around third and tried to score but first baseman Carlos Santana threw Davis out at the plate as catcher Yan Gomes made the tag.	The Indians got consecutive one-out singles from Mike Aviles and Jason Kipnis in the third but Santana grounded into a double play to end the inning.	Cleveland third baseman Giovanny Urshela hit into an inning-ending double play in the fifth and Santana did so again in the sixth.	Tigers catcher James McCann tripled with one out in the seventh but was stranded when Iglesias grounded out and Gose struck out.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers star RHP Justin Verlander, who has been out since the beginning of the season with a right triceps strain, is scheduled make his 2015 debut on Saturday afternoon.	COMING UP	Verlander will face Indians RHP Carlos Carrasco (7-5, 4.35), who is 2-6 with a 7.20 ERA against Detroit over 13 games -- including eight starts.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

BOSTON -- The highest scoring team in baseball put up its highest scoring inning of the season.	The Toronto Blue Jays scored nine runs in the seventh -- all before making an out -- and beat the Boston Red Sox 13-10 by overcoming an 8-1 deficit Friday night for their ninth straight win.	"Incredible," Toronto manager John Gibbons said of the outburst.	"Relentless" is how Russell Martin described the offense after his bases-loaded triple snapped an 8-8 tie.	"Long" was Boston manager John Farrell's analysis of his team's worst inning in a year in which it is in last place in the AL East and a season-worst eight games under .500 (27-35).	Justin Smoak drove in three runs, two scoring on his homer that made it 13-8 on the first pitch after Martin's triple.	"It was awesome," Smoak said. "It can happen any time with this lineup."	Trailing 13-9, the Red Sox had a chance to tie it in the eighth when they loaded the bases after Xander Bogaerts singled in a run. But with two outs, Mike Napoli took a called third strike.	"My mindset was to go up there and do some damage," Napoli said. "It's a tough one to swallow."	Brett Cecil gave up an RBI double in the ninth to Rusney Castillo but got his third save.	Steve Delabar (2-0) pitched a perfect sixth. Junichi Tazawa (0-2) took the loss.	Boston took a 5-0 lead in the first against Drew Hutchison when Pablo Sandoval, a two-run shot, and Mookie Betts hit back-to-back homers and David Ortiz had a two-run single. Smoak's RBI-triple made it 5-1 in the second before Dustin Pedroia's three-run homer put Boston on top 8-1 in the fifth.	Toronto scored three runs in the fifth off Joe Kelly, who left after the sixth with an 8-4 lead.	Then came the seventh when Toronto's first nine batters reached base -- three against Matt Barnes, five against Tazawa and one against Tommy Layne -- with all of them scoring.	"We have a ton of power and when we have that there's always a chance to come back," Gibbons said. "I don't put anything past these guys."	Toronto entered the night with 325 runs, 50 more than the New York Yankees, who had the second-most in the majors.	Kevin Pillar led off the seventh with a single and scored on a double by Ryan Goins. Jose Reyes then singled in a run, Josh Donaldson singled and Jose Bautista followed with another RBI single.	Edwin Encarnacion then singled, loading the bases, and Toronto tied it at 8 on an error by third baseman Sandoval, who dived to catch Chris Colabello's hard shot down the line then dropped the ball.	Martin cleared the bases with his triple over the head of center fielder Castillo, chasing Tazawa. But Smoak drove the first pitch from Layne into the seats in left for his fifth homer and a 13-8 lead. Layne then settled down, retiring the next three batters.	Red Sox relievers retired the last nine Blue Jays.	THE LAST TIME	Toronto's last nine-run inning also came at Fenway Park. It happened in the sixth inning last July 28 in a 14-1 win. Only three players in that lineup -- Reyes, Bautista and Goins -- played Friday night.	CLEARING THE AIR	Boston LHP Wade Miley said before the game "I handled it terribly" when he yelled at Farrell in the dugout Thursday night after being taken out after four innings of a 6-5 loss at Baltimore. Farrell said Miley's behavior was "unacceptable."	TRAINERS ROOM	Red Sox: LF Hanley Ramirez missed the game with soreness in his left knee and left hamstring. ... CF Betts left the game in the top of the third with a low back sprain when he ran into the low fence trying to catch a triple by Smoak.	ON DECK	Blue Jays: RHP R.A. Dickey (2-6, 5.35) goes for his third straight solid outing in the second game of the three-game series. He allowed a total of four runs in his past two starts after giving up 22 in his previous four.	Red Sox: RHP Clay Buchholz (3-6, 4.07) tries to bounce back from his third-shortest stint of the season. He allowed four runs and 10 hits in 4 2/3 innings Sunday in a 7-4 win against Oakland. In his previous start, he allowed three hits in eight innings in a 1-0 victory over Minnesota.	---	This includes that Toronto has won nine straight games.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

NEW YORK --  Bartolo Colon was not at his best as he labored through the middle innings. No surprise to anyone, the burly, 42-year-old right-hander still managed to make big pitches when he needed them.	Colon moved into a tie for the major league lead with his ninth win, Wilmer Flores and John Mayberry Jr. homered, and the New York Mets held on to beat the Atlanta Braves 5-3 on Friday night.	"He didn't have his good stuff," manager Terry Collins said, "but he battles so well you kind of liked where you were sitting, even in the sixth inning. Today he really had to work for it and he kept us in it."	Colon (9-4) gave up two runs and six hits in six innings as he matched Seattle's Felix Hernandez, who was roughed up at Houston, and Pittsburgh's Gerrit Cole for the most victories in baseball.	Jeurys Familia, whose availability for the game was uncertain because he was awaiting the birth of his child, loaded the bases with one out in the ninth before getting Nick Markakis to ground into a double play for his 18th save.	Markakis also grounded into a double play against Alex Torres in the seventh with the bases loaded and no outs, pulling Atlanta to 4-3, and he bounced out to Colon with three aboard in the fifth and two outs.	"Just some bad at-bats by me today," Markakis said. "I think I was thinking up there too much and you get yourself into trouble when you start doing that."	Michael Cuddyer followed up his game-winning hit Thursday against San Francisco with an RBI double in the seventh as New York beat Atlanta for a fifth straight time after losing the first two games between the teams this year.	The NL East-leading Mets improved to 22-11 in the weak division.	Alex Wood (4-4) entered his 12th start of the season having allowed only two home runs -- one was to Cuddyer on April 12 -- but he was tagged twice early by the Mets.	Flores connected leading off the second, in his first career at-bat in the No. 4 hole.	With slumping left-handed Lucas Duda out of the lineup against a lefty, Collins elevated the rookie shortstop into the cleanup spot but was quick to say that this move was just a one-day necessity.	Mayberry hit a two-run shot in the fourth after Flores was intentionally walked with one out to give New York a 3-0 lead.	But the Braves loaded the bases with three straight singles to open the fifth. Wood then hit a grounder to short for a potential double play and Flores bobbled the ball before flipping to second for the force. A.J. Pierzynski scored and Wood had an RBI.	Jace Peterson doubled in a run to make it 3-2.	The Braves had two runners on in the sixth but, for the second straight inning, Colon got the final out on a comebacker.	"I felt a little tired to be honest with you in the fifth inning," Colon said. "It was humid, it was hot, was just tired of the weather."	Colon matched Dwight Gooden's franchise record established in 1993-94 with a decision in 25 straight starts, a streak that started July 23, 2014. Colon is 16-9 over that span.	Eric Campbell had an RBI groundout in the bottom of the sixth. Mayberry, who singled for his second hit and advanced when Dilson Herrera walked, was on third because Wood threw a pickoff attempt at second base into center field.	Wood allowed five runs -- four earned -- and six hits in 6 1/3 innings	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: The Mets placed reliever Erik Goeddel on the 15-day DL because of a strained right elbow. Goeddel had not allowed a run since May 27, 5 2/3 scoreless innings.	UP NEXT	Braves: RHP Shelby Miller lowered his ERA to 1.84 when he allowed just one run in seven innings against San Diego in his last start.	Mets: RHP Jacob deGrom was named co-NL player of the week with Clayton Kershaw after going 2-0 with a 1.20 ERA. DeGrom is 2-1 with a 2.00 ERA in three starts vs. the Braves.	CALL IT WHAT YOU WANT	Dillon Gee will make a spot start for New York on Sunday, pushing Noah Syndergaard and the rest of the starters back a day in an attempt to help manage innings of the team's young star pitchers. The Mets recently backtracked on a plan to use a six-man rotation. "It's not a six-man rotation, it's a five-man rotation, but we're going to slip somebody in because we think maybe a day here is an extra day that will help out," Collins said.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

MIAMI --  His work done for the night, Miami Marlins pitcher Jose Urena skipped off the mound with the footwork of a colt. It was the only time he looked like a rookie.	The 23-year-old right-hander pitched into the seventh inning for his first major league victory, and the Marlins supported him with some slugging to beat the Colorado Rockies 5-1 Friday night.	"It's a great feeling," Urena said through a translator. "It's hard to describe. It's what every pitcher goes out there looking to accomplish."	The Marlins hit two home runs, neither by major league leader Giancarlo Stanton, and nearly had a third.	Rookie catcher J.T. Realmuto hit a three-run homer, and Martin Prado had a solo shot. Marcell Ozuna's two-run drive was wiped out by a replay review that determined the ball hooked foul into the stands, so he settled five pitches later for an RBI single.	Stanton had a single and a double and scored a run.	The Rockies lost their third game in a row and have totaled one run in the first two games of the series.	"We're having a hard time stringing hits together," manager Walt Weiss said.	Urena (1-2) dominated in his fourth major league start, allowing six hits and no walks in 6 2/3 innings.	"He just challenged in the strike zone pitch after pitch," Marlins manager Dan Jennings said. "He pitched aggressively. He has no fear."	Urena took a shutout into the seventh before Carlos Gonzalez hit his seventh homer, ending a string of 17 consecutive scoreless innings for Colorado.	Urena limited the Rockies to one run in six innings last week but did not get a decision. He was considered a stopgap replacement when he joined the Marlins' injury-riddled rotation, but may prove tough to dislodge, even with three starters expected to return in the next few weeks.	"We'll cross that bridge when we get there," Jennings said. "Right now Urena is in that rotation, and somebody will have to knock him out. He has earned the right to get that opportunity every fifth day."	Said Urena: "I don't have any doubts in my abilities."	Kyle Kendrick (2-8) allowed only two runs in 6 2/3 innings, but moved into a tie for the major league lead in losses. He fell to 14-4 in 28 games against the Marlins.	Miami's Dee Gordon went 1 for 4 to retain his lead in the major league batting race over the Rockies' DJ LeMahieu, who also went 1 for 4. Gordon is hitting .355, LeMahieu .349.	Ozuna's single in the fourth extended his hitting streak to 13 games and gave Miami a 1-0 lead.	Prado went sprawling when he ducked out of the way of a high-and-inside fastball from Kendrick, and then hit the next pitch for a homer to make it 2-0 in the sixth.	Realmuto's third homer came off Scott Oberg and followed a pair of walks in the eighth.	Colorado's Troy Tulowitzki extended his hitting streak to 11 games with a single in the fourth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins ace Jose Fernandez (elbow) pitched five scoreless innings in his second rehab start for Class A Jupiter.	UP NEXT	Marlins RHP Mat Latos, sidelined since May 21 with left knee inflammation, is scheduled to start Saturday against Rockies RHP David Hale.	Latos is 1-4 with a 6.12 ERA, and the Marlins' depleted rotation is a combined 17-23. Fernandez, Jarred Cosart and Henderson Alvarez are all expected to return from injuries in the next month.	"We've got to get the pitching right, myself included," Latos said. "We have guys who can do it."	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Joey Butler is on a roll, and his Tampa Bay teammates joined in Friday night during a 7-5 victory over the Chicago White Sox.	A 29-year-old rookie who had only 17 major league at-bats before this season, Butler had three of the Rays' 14 hits to help fellow rookie Matt Andriese earn his first career win.	"I'm getting more and more confident," said Butler, who drove in two runs and raised his batting average to .342 in 117 at-bats. "It's definitely the best opportunity I've had, just playing every day, always being in the lineup. And that helps."	He has hit safely in 12 of his last 13 games and has nine hits in the last five games.	"He's been playing for a long time and hasn't had many opportunities. He's getting one and he's making the most of it, for sure," Rays manager Kevin Cash said.	Andriese (1-1) gave up two runs -- both unearned -- in a career-high 5 2/3 innings. He struck out five in the 26th game started by a Rays rookie this season. Of the six hits allowed by Andriese, one was a bunt single and the others were two-out singles.	Hits by Mikie Mahtook, Brandon Guyer and Butler gave the Rays a 2-0 lead in the first inning against John Danks, and the Rays led all the way in ending Chicago's three-game win streak.	Jake McGee pitched the ninth for his second save.	Steven Souza Jr., Jake Elmore, Nick Franklin and Kevin Kiermaier had two hits each for the Rays, who have won nine of 13 and moved within one game of the first-place New York Yankees in the AL East.	Jose Abreu hit his 12th home run for the White Sox, connecting in a third straight game for the first time in his career.	Danks (3-6) gave up five runs, three earned, and eight hits in 5 1/3 innings.	"They put the ball in play and made things happen. It worked out for them," Danks said. "It's one of those nights it didn't bounce my way."	The Rays haven't had many of those nights lately. Their seven runs were the most they have scored in a home game in more than a month. Both teams had gone seven straight games without scoring five runs.	"I wouldn't say we're struggling, but we haven't had key hits with men on base," Franklin said. "Tonight we did."	Danks became the seventh straight left-handed starter to lose to the Rays. He is 1-5 with a 5.71 ERA in his last seven starts against the Rays after going 5-1 with a 2.35 ERA in his first six against Tampa Bay.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: RHP Andrew Bellatti, placed on the disabled list Thursday with right shoulder tendinitis, hopes to throw as soon as Sunday.	CAUGHT SHORT	Having designated C Bobby Wilson for assignment late Thursday, the Rays played Friday night's game with only one catcher, Rene Rivera. "You just hope that nothing freakish happens early on," Cash said before the game. "Let's just hope we get through the ballgame." Tampa Bay recalled C Curt Casali from Triple-A Durham after the game and optioned Mahtook to its top farm club.	MANAGER FOR A WEEKEND	Bench coach Mark Parent is managing the White Sox this weekend in the absence of Robin Ventura, who is attending the graduation of his daughter, Madison.	UP NEXT	Rays RHP Chris Archer (7-4), who according to the Rays is the first pitcher since 1900 to have 10 or more strikeouts and no walks in three consecutive starts, will face Jeff Samardzija (4-4) of the White Sox on Saturday.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Waiting in the on-deck circle, Elvis Andrus started trying to blow the ball Mitch Moreland had just hit to center field.	Maybe it wasn't the extra air but something worked to give the Texas Rangers a 6-2 victory over the Minnesota Twins on Friday night.	Andrus had a career-high four RBI, but it was Moreland's two-out fly ball to center in the eighth inning that went off Aaron Hicks' glove for a tiebreaking two-base, two-run error.	"That's the longest hit error I've ever seen. I'm shaking my head on that," Rangers manager Jeff Banister said.	Hicks was drifting back and reached up, but the ball flicked off his glove and rolled to the wall, breaking a 2-all tie in Minnesota's fourth consecutive loss.	"It was just a low-liner that was hit hard, and for me, that's a ball I catch all the time. I just happened to miss it and that's it," Hicks said. "Ridiculous. I don't understand how I missed the ball and it's like I said, I know I make that play every time."	After standout performances by both left-handed starters, Wandy Rodriguez for the Rangers and Tommy Milone for the Twins, neither got a decision.	Minnesota, which used four pitchers in the eighth inning, had intentionally walked AL batting leader Prince Fielder to load the bases. Moreland hit the first pitch from Brian Duensing, and Andrus added a two-run single after another pitching change.	Andrus' two-run homer in the seventh off Milone ended a 20-inning scoreless streak for the Rangers and put them up 2-1.	His third homer of the season came in the next at-bat after he slammed his bat down in frustration after striking out to end the fourth.	"I was starting to get mad, I was swinging at too many pitches," Andrus said. "In that at-bat, I was just trying to look for my pitch, really happy to get that homer, and we got back in the game."	Leadoff hitter Brian Dozier scored both runs for Minnesota. Dozier walked to start the game, and his 12th homer of the season leading off the eighth off reliever Tanner Scheppers (3-0) made it 2-2.	Aaron Thompson (1-2) took over to start the eighth and allowed a walk and a fielder's choice before Minnesota made three more pitching changes in the inning.	Milone struck out eight and limited the Rangers to three hits over seven innings, retiring 12 straight in one stretch. He had allowed only one hit before Fielder's leadoff single in the seventh and Andrus' homer.	After Minnesota loaded the bases without an out in the first, Rodriguez retired 18 straight batters.	LOT OF PITCHES	Rodriguez threw 122 pitches, the last coming on a 10-pitch walk by Eduardo Escobar that loaded the bases in the seventh. Rodriguez struck out six and walked three while throwing the most pitches by a Texas pitcher since Yu Darvish's 126 in a near no-hitter against the Boston Red Sox on May 9, 2014.	PLOUFFE, IT'S GONE	Twins cleanup hitter Trevor Plouffe, whose sacrifice fly made it 1-0 in the first, ended Rodriguez's streak of 18 batters straight retired with a leadoff single in the seventh.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: Slugger Josh Hamilton is doing a "brisk jog" on a treadmill, but still has not swung a bat since straining his left hamstring May 31. He said the tightness in his left hamstring has subsided, but still has general soreness in both hamstrings. ... LHPs Matt Harrison (spinal fusion surgery) and Martin Perez (Tommy John surgery) are both set for starts for Triple-A Round Rock, Harrison makes his third rehab start Sunday in Memphis and Perez his second next week when the Express are back home. ... LHP Derek Holland (left shoulder strain) will get another MRI next Friday.	UP NEXT	Twins: RHP Mike Pelfry, whose 2.28 ERA is fourth-lowest in the AL, starts five days after tossing eight scoreless innings against Milwaukee.	Rangers: RHP Colby Lewis will be trying to get a win against the only AL team he has never defeated as a Ranger. Lewis is 0-4 with a 7.53 ERA in seven career starts against the Twins.	---	This clarifies that Thompson gave up walk and fielder's choice.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

MILWAUKEE --  Mike Fiers worked his two-part plan against the Washington Nationals to perfection.	Fiers pitched seven effective innings, Aramis Ramirez hit three doubles and drove in five runs, and the Milwaukee Brewers beat the Nationals 8-4 on Friday night.	"That's what I have to do: pitch in the zone and trust in my defense," Fiers said. "I was focused on pounding the zone, going right after those guys and make them earn their hits and earn their runs."	Fiers (3-6) allowed three runs and five hits. He struck out eight and walked three in his second career victory in two starts against the Nationals. The right-hander pitched 6 1/3 scoreless innings in a 6-0 win against Washington July 27, 2012, and made two relief appearances against them last season.	"I try to pitch around too many guys," Fiers said. "So, I have to trust in myself and get off the field as quick as possible. That's what I did."	Second baseman Scooter Gennett turned in a defensive gem in the fourth. Wilson Ramos hit a sharply hit ball that Gennett snagged with a dive that carried him well behind the bag at second. Without getting up, he flipped the ball with his glove to shortstop Jean Segura who grabbed it barehanded and stepped on the bag to just get Bryce Harper.	"At first I thought it was a hit, right off the bat, but he made a great play," Fiers said. "That's what we need, every night. Guys just playing hard, playing with their heart and getting a win."	Fiers escaped a two-out bases loaded jam in the sixth when he got pinch-hitter Danny Espinosa on a long fly ball that Shane Patterson caught on the warning track in left.	Ramirez put Milwaukee ahead 2-0 in the first with his ninth double of the season. His 10th drove in a run in the third. Then he highlighted the Brewers' four-run fourth inning with his 11th, a two-run line drive off reliever Taylor Hill. Jonathan Lucroy knocked in the other two runs that inning with a single.	"You need nights like tonight where he kind of just drives the bus offensively and just cleans everything up," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. "He did it tonight, thats for sure."	Jordan Zimmermann (5-4) allowed six runs and nine hits in 3 1/3 innings, the shortest start since going 2 1/3 on April 13. He walked one and struck out four.	He came in 4-0 with a 2.35 ERA in five career starts against the Brewers, but couldn't locate his pitches and it cost him just like his last start, a 6-3 loss to the Chicago Cubs on Sunday when he allowed four runs and 10 hits in five innings.	"It's mainly location and not hitting the spots," Zimmermann said.	Bryce Harper did what he could to keep the Nationals close. He hit a solo shot, his 21st home run of the season, leading off the second and knocked in the second run with an RBI single in the third.	Harper turned a bit philosophical describing the loss.	"Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, and sometimes it rains," he said.	Tyler Moore homered in the seventh and Ramos's double off reliever Corey Knebel in the eighth drove in Harper.	Nationals manager Matt Williams' astute eye cost the Brewers a run in the third. He asked for a review of second base umpire Todd Tichenor's safe call at second. Gerardo Parra dove head first back to the bag on a pickoff play as shortstop Ian Desmond applied the tag. It took 59 seconds for the timely reversal. One batter later, Ramirez doubled home Ryan Braun from first.	Adam Lind made it 8-2 with a run-scoring in the sixth. Each position player had at least one hit for Milwaukee which tied its season-high with 16 hits.	Jonathan Broxton pitched the ninth for Milwaukee.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: Stephen Strasburg, on the DL with neck tightness since May 30, threw 60 pitches before Friday night's game. The right-hander used all his pitches and there were no issues, according to Williams. Strasburg (3-5, 6.55 ERA) would be re-evaluated Saturday. ... The Nationals activated newly acquired right-handed reliever David Carpenter after placing right-hander Aaron Barrett on the 15-day disabled list with a strained right bicep. Carpenter got into the game in the eighth and retired the side in order.	Brewers: CF Carlos Gomez (sore legs) missed his third consecutive game. "He's day-to-day, but hopefully tomorrow," Counsell said.	UP NEXT	Nationals: RHP Joe Ross (0-1) is scheduled to make his first career road start Saturday. In his debut against the Chicago Cubs on June 6, he allowed three earned runs on six hits over five innings.	Brewers: RHP Jimmy Nelson (3-6, 4.05 ERA) looks to make his sixth quality start Saturday against a team he's never faced.	GOING DEEP	The Nationals have homered in seven straight games, their longest streak of the season.	NICE TO BE BACK	Gennett has hit safely in both games since he was recalled from Triple-A Colorado Springs. With two hits Friday night, he earned his first multi-hit game of the season.	FOUR WHIFFS	Desmond went 0 for 4 with four strikeouts.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

HOUSTON -- The Houston Astros cast aside their recent offensive woes with an unlikely outburst against one of the game's best pitchers Friday night to snap a season-high, seven-game skid.	Luis Valbuena and Jason Castro homered as the Astros chased Felix Hernandez during an eight-run first inning on the way to a 10-0 win over the Seattle Mariners.	The Astros had managed more than two runs just once during their losing streak before jumping on Hernandez for more runs than they'd scored in the last three games combined.	"Probably one of our best innings of the year," manager A.J. Hinch said. "It had been built up over the last week or so. Very unpredictable to do that against a guy like Felix, but much needed."	Carlos Correa and Chris Carter also went deep for the Astros, but All-Star second baseman Jose Altuve left early with discomfort in his right hamstring. Hinch said the team doesn't think the injury is serious, but Altuve will be out of the lineup on Saturday.	Hernandez (9-3), who had allowed just seven runs on the road all season, was tagged for five hits and eight runs with two walks. He got only one out, tying the shortest start of his career.	"I don't know what happened," a stone-faced Hernandez said. "To be honest, I don't really know."	Brett Oberholtzer (1-1) allowed three hits in eight sharp innings and Joe Thatcher completed the four-hitter. It was Oberholtzer's fourth start of the season after missing much of the year because of two stints on the disabled list.	Seattle became the first team since the Montreal Expos in April 2004 to score three runs or fewer 15 times in a 16-game span, according to STATS.	"It certainly isn't ideal," Kyle Seager said. "You'd like to score nine runs every night, but ... we'll be all right."	The Astros were up by three before a three-run shot by Valbuena, and Castro added a two-run homer two batters later to make it 8-0 and end King Felix's night.	"They just kept getting hits," Hernandez said. "The home run from Castro was unreal. It was just one of those days."	Correa, a highly touted rookie making his home debut, was the only out Hernandez got before his early exit. But the top pick in the 2012 draft added a solo homer in the second, and Carter pushed the lead to double digits with his soaring shot in the fifth.	The abbreviated start by Hernandez forced the Mariners to use four relievers before going to catcher Jesus Sucre for the eighth. Sucre was effective, allowing one hit in a scoreless inning in his first major league pitching appearance.	Manager Lloyd McClendon said he used Sucre to keep from further taxing a bullpen that had to pitch 5 2/3 innings on Thursday before Friday's fiasco.	Altuve got the big inning going with a leadoff single before Preston Tucker walked on four pitches. George Springer's double down the right-field line made it 1-0 before things really started falling apart for Hernandez.	Evan Gattis hit a one-hopper to Hernandez on the next pitch, and the right-hander threw home to try and stop Tucker from scoring. Instead, Hernandez threw it in the dirt and the ball bounced off catcher Mike Zunino's leg for an error that allowed two runs to score and Gattis to reach second.	Hernandez shook his fist and cursed at himself after the ball rolled away and the runners crossed the plate.	After a short mound visit, Hernandez walked Colby Rasmus before striking out Correa for the first out of the inning.	But then Valbuena snapped an 0-for-19 slump by sending an 88 mph changeup into the bullpen in right-center to extend the lead to 6-0 and leave the 2010 AL Cy Young Award winner shaking his head.	"Blink of an eye, it was 6-0," Hernandez said. "Fifteen pitches."	Carter singled before Castro launched a homer to the Crawford Boxes in left field to make it 8-0 and end Hernandez's night just 31 pitches after it began. He looked bewildered as he watched Castro's drive and mumbled to himself before covering his mouth with his glove as he slowly walked to the dugout.	The other time Hernandez left after getting just one out came on April 18, 2007, when he was pulled because of an injury.	It was the most runs he had allowed since giving up nine -- eight earned -- on Aug. 28, 2013, against Texas and just two away from his career high of 10. Hernandez was great in the first two months of the season and had an ERA of 1.91 entering June. But he's struggled in two of his three starts this month to push it to 3.38.	Houston's eight runs were the most the team has scored in an inning since also scoring eight on Aug. 12, 2008.	CORREA'S CHEERING SECTION	Correa had a large contingent of family and friends at the game. They all wore T-shirts with his name and number on them and waved the flag of his native Puerto Rico when he homered. He received a standing ovation from the home crowd before his first at-bat.	"It was a shocking moment for me," he said. "It's something that I will never forget when I step to the plate and they just start cheering for me and screaming. It was just a great moment and something I will keep forever."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: All-Star RHP Hisashi Iwakuma (tightness in upper back) is scheduled to throw a simulated game Monday and if that goes well he could go on a rehabilitation assignment next weekend.	Astros: RHP Samuel Deduno (right hip) is expected to throw live batting practice in the next few days and then go on a rehab assignment.	UP NEXT	Seattle rookie left-hander Mike Montgomery opposes Collin McHugh when the series continues Saturday. Montgomery has a 2.08 ERA but is looking for his first win in his third career start.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ST. LOUIS --  Jaime Garcia pitched eight innings of four-hit ball and saved some shutdown stuff for the media, too.	The St. Louis Cardinals lefty had little to say about perhaps his best outing in two years.	"I'm extremely happy for the team," Garcia said without conviction after also helping himself with an RBI single in a 4-0 victory that ended the Kansas City Royals' four-game winning streak Friday night in the opener of a high-profile interleague series.	"When you're healthy and you're going out and competing, you're always happy," Garcia added. "I'll enjoy the win tonight for the team and turn the page and get ready for the next one."	Garcia worked more than seven innings for the first time since May 5, 2013, when he went eight in a 10-1 victory at Milwaukee.	Jon Jay snapped a 2-for-24 slump this month with a two-out RBI triple in the second off Yordano Ventura (3-6), and Garcia followed with his 12th career RBI on an opposite-field single -- his first since June 3, 2014, against Kansas City.	The Cardinals are 40-21 overall and 23-7 at home, both major league bests. They got a huge outing from Garcia (2-3), so far a success story off thoracic outlet surgery.	"He was as good as we've seen him," manager Mike Matheny said. "I don't know if you could ask for anything more.	"It's no fun to catch, no fun to hit."	Ventura lasted just three innings for the second straight start, removed as a precaution due to weakness in his pitching hand. In those two starts, he's allowed six earned runs.	Royals manager Ned Yost said the team was watching closely because Ventura's velocity was down and in the third the pitcher had trouble with his grip.	Yost said he couldn't recall the last time he heard the term "right hand weakness."	"Of course, you have a level of concern because you don't really know what it is yet," Yost added. "But we'll wait till tomorrow and see what's going on."	The infield had a meeting on the mound during Ventura's final at-bat, a flyout by Yadier Molina. Ventura said through translator Christian Colon that his thumb, right ring finger and pinky had gone numb and that he'd felt "really weird."	Ventura also said he didn't know whether he'd be able to make his next start.	Garcia struck out six with no walks, fanning Omar Infante to open the eighth for the 500th strikeout of his career, and retired the side in order five times. The lefty lowered his ERA to 2.06 and hasn't issued a walk in 30 innings.	Garcia has made five starts -- the Cardinals have been shut out in three of them -- after totaling 16 starts from 2013-14. He'd been 0 for 8 with four strikeouts before the hit.	In the eighth, Randal Grichuk had an RBI triple on a ball that right fielder Alex Rios whiffed on, and Jay added sacrifice fly. Center fielder Lorenzo Cain, who'd also converged on Grichuk's fly ball, called it a "miscommunication."	The last four lineup spots combined for five hits, three for extra bases, and three RBI.	"I think you've seen that with our lineup before," Jay said. "Everyone can hit everywhere."	The Royals got two infield hits with two outs in the sixth but Garcia struck out cleanup man Eric Hosmer on an off-speed pitch that ended up at shoe-top level.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals: LHP Danny Duffy (biceps tendinitis) has made one rehab start for Triple-A Omaha, working four innings Wednesday, and could make a few more before rejoining the rotation.	Cardinals: Setup man Jordan Walden (right biceps) could be back before the All-Star break.	UP NEXT	Jeremy Guthrie is 3-0 with a 1.85 ERA in six interleague starts with the Royals. Tyler Lyons, recalled from Triple-A Memphis to replace injured Lance Lynn, was 0-0 with a 5.54 ERA in three starts earlier this season. He's 3-1 with a 2.36 ERA in his last four minor league starts.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  The Los Angeles Angels won the kind of game that pennant-contending teams need to win on a regular basis. Mike Trout and Kole Calhoun delivered for them when it counted most.	Trout and Calhoun drove in the tying and go-ahead runs with eighth-inning homers, leading the Angels to a seesaw 5-4 victory over the Oakland Athletics on Friday night.	"I think we've got a really good squad here with a bunch of scrappy baseball players," Calhoun said. "You can kind of tell with all the one-run ballgames that we've played this year. So we never feel like we're out of a game -- even when we were down six runs in New York in the ninth and lost by one. So we know we've got it in us."	Josh Reddick had given the A's a 4-3 lead in the seventh with a two-run shot against Fernando Salas. That put starter Jesse Chavez in line for a victory after Brett Lawrie and Josh Phegley supported him with back-to-back homers in the fourth against Hector Santiago.	But Evan Scribner (1-1) served up Trout's 18th of the season leading off the eighth, then retired Albert Pujols on a towering fly to the warning track in left before Calhoun drove a 1-0 pitch deep into the seats in right for his sixth of the season. It was the fourth lead change of the game.	"Today it was all me. Two pitches up in the zone. That's all it was," Scribner said in a hushed voice. "I can't make mistakes to those guys."	Jose Alvarez (1-1) pitched a perfect eighth for the victory and Huston Street got three outs for his 18th save in 20 attempts, retiring Reddick on a fly ball to center with his 26th pitch of the ninth and runners at first and second.	Trout led off the sixth with a single, Pujols followed with a double and Calhoun drove them in with a single up the middle on Chavez's next pitch. Johnny Giavotella then barely beat out a grounder to third, but was called out by umpire Chris Conroy.	Television replays confirmed that the runner was safe, but Angels manager Mike Scioscia was out of challenges by then after burning an earlier one in which Oakland's Mark Canha's steal of second base in the third inning was upheld. Scioscia charged out of the dugout after Giavotella's ruling and had a lengthy one-way argument with Conroy before he was ejected.	"That was the first time I've seen that side of him, so it was good to see the fire in him -- and it was contagious with us," Giavotella said. "Unfortunately, we didn't have any challenges left, so we were forced to go with whatever the umpire called. I felt like I was safe -- and the replay showed that I actually was. Fortunately for us, Mike Trout and Kole Calhoun stepped up."	Santiago threw 106 pitches in 5 2/3 innings, allowing two runs and seven hits with six strikeouts and a walk before leaving with a 2-1 deficit. He was 3-0 with a 1.01 ERA in his six previous career starts against Oakland.	After stranding a runner at second base in each of the first three innings, Santiago retired the first two batters in the fourth before Lawrie ended an 0-for-16 drought with his sixth homer and Phegley hit his second four pitches later.	"Having nine days off with that relief appearance in the middle, it was definitely different," Santiago said.	Giavotella led off the second with a double and scored on Efren Navarro's single off Chavez, who allowed three runs and seven hits over seven innings on five days' rest.	IN THE FOLD	The Angels signed C Taylor Ward, four days after making him their No. 1 draft pick. He will report to their rookie-level team in Orem, Utah, on Sunday.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: Pat Venditte, who last week became the first ambidextrous pitcher to appear in a major league game since Greg Harris in 1995 was placed on the 15-day DL because of a right shoulder strain. The move is retroactive to June 10. Venditte is the ninth player currently on the team's DL. They already have used the DL 17 times this season, one fewer than last year, and 15 players have been on it -- including CF Coco Crisp and closer Sean Doolittle twice each.	Angels: 3B David Freese sat out his fourth straight game because of tightness in his right hamstring, although Scioscia said during batting practice that he was available to pinch-hit. ... OF Collin Cowgill continues to experience stiffness in his right hand after two days of batting practice. He has been on the DL since May 28. ... RHP Mike Morin, threw off a mound for the first time since straining his left oblique muscle on May 24.	UP NEXT	Athletics: Kendall Graveman (3-2) faced the Angels on April 20 in Anaheim, throwing 73 pitches in three-plus innings and leaving with a 5-3 lead after walking his first two batters in the fourth. But he is 2-0 with a 2.55 ERA in his last four starts.	Angels: LHP C.J. Wilson (3-5) is 1-4 with a 6.00 ERA his last five starts, including a 6-2 loss at Yankee Stadium last Sunday, when he gave up six runs, seven hits and three homers in seven innings.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN DIEGO --  If this was Clayton Kershaw struggling, the San Diego Padres don't want any part of him when he's on.	After breezing through six innings, Kershaw was lifted in the seventh and Los Angeles squandered the lead before pinch-hitter Alex Guerrero singled home the tiebreaking run to lead the Dodgers to a 4-3 victory Friday night.	Kershaw subdued the Padres through six innings, but the game had two big shifts in the seventh and eighth.	Derek Norris hit a two-run homer in the seventh off winner Yimi Garcia to give the Padres a 3-2 lead. But the Dodgers bounced right back with two runs off relievers Dale Thayer (2-1) and Shawn Kelley.	"It was a lot of back and forth, a lot of big hits by us and them," Kershaw said. "It was a good win for us."	The Dodgers won their fourth straight game, though Kershaw didn't get the decision. The reigning NL MVP and three-time Cy Young Award winner was effective even though he struggled with his fastball command.	"A win is definitely a win, but I would have liked Clayton to get the win," Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said. "It seemed like it was a battle for him, command-wise with the fastball. But it shows you just what kind of a competitor he is that he continues to fight and battle the whole game."	Kershaw had been dominant through six innings, allowing just three hits.	But then Clint Barmes hit a one-out homer in the seventh off Kershaw, who was lifted one out later for Garcia (3-2). Wil Myers hit a high popup in front of the mound and Justin Turner, playing first base, went to catch it but ran into Garcia and dropped the ball for an error.	On the next pitch, Norris hammered his seventh home run into the brick Western Metal Supply Co. building seats for the lead.	"Obviously, I can't give up that homer," Kershaw said. "I might be able to finish the seventh and we might get out of there with a 2-0 win."	Kershaw struck out 11 and walked three as he continued his recent dominant stretch.	The left-hander has allowed just three earned runs and 10  hits with 39 strikeouts in 28 2/3 innings over his last four starts. Kershaw leads the majors with 111 strikeouts.	"The game plan against Kershaw was to be aggressive," Barmes said. "Guys were able to make him work a little bit more."	Howie Kendrick, who led off with a double against Thayer and went to third on an error, scored on Turner's single to tie it 3-all. With two outs, Andre Ethier scored on Guerrero's single off Kelley.	Norris' homer capped a three-run inning that ruined Kershaw's bid to win his fourth straight start.	Kenley Jensen pitched the ninth for his eighth save in nine chances.	Adrian Gonzalez and A.J. Ellis each had an RBI single for the Dodgers.	Gonzalez grounded into an inning-ending double play with the bases loaded in the seventh and was ejected after he said something to plate umpire Doug Eddings as he ran back to the dugout.	NO JUNE SWOON	Kershaw had won nine consecutive June starts.	KERSHAW VS. DESPAIGNE	Since making his major league debut last season, San Diego starter Odrisamer Despaigne has opposed Kershaw three times and the Padres have lost all three. Kershaw was the winner twice.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: Turner started at 3B after being sidelined for two games. He fouled a ball off his left knee on Monday. ... RHP Brandon Beachy is expected to begin a minor league rehab assignment next week. Beachy, who underwent Tommy John surgery in August 2013, has been on the 60-day disabled list all season. ... INF-OF Scott Van Slyke (back inflammation) is scheduled to play in a couple of rehab games next week.	Padres: LHP Corey Luebke is set to pitch Saturday in a game for the first time in more than three years. Luebke, who has had two Tommy John operations, is scheduled to start a minor league rehab assignment with Class A Lake Elsinore. Luebke has not pitched in the majors since winning a start against San Francisco in April 2012.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: RHP Zack Greinke looks to continue his dominance against NL West foes since joining the club in 2013. Greinke is 22-2 with a 2.06 ERA while holding NL West hitters to a .214 batting average.	Padres: In two starts against the Dodgers this season, RHP Ian Kennedy is 0-2 with an 8.71 ERA, allowing 10 earned runs and 14 hits -- including four homers -- in 10 1/3 innings.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

SAN FRANCISCO --  The sting in his leg was secondary. When a sharp comebacker by Buster Posey ricocheted off Chase Anderson's right calf, Arizona's starter just hoped someone would get to the ball in time to make a play.	Instead, the right-hander lost his no-hit bid when he got hit in Arizona's 1-0 victory against the San Francisco Giants on Friday night, which ended a four-game losing streak.	"I was just hoping it would go to someone so we could get him out," Anderson said. "It hit me, it just felt tight. I was just like, `I'm not coming out of the game, obviously.' It wasn't that bad."	Anderson grimaced in pain as the ball rolled toward the third-base line, leaving the Diamondbacks without a play on Posey's infield single. But the right-hander finished the inning and outpitched World Series MVP Madison Bumgarner as the Giants lost their sixth straight home game.	"I was kind of looking for it. I looked over and it looked too far away -- he's going to beat that out," Anderson said. "I wish it would have went to somebody."	Anderson (2-1) struck out two, walked one and plunked No. 7 hitter Matt Duffy twice before giving way to Daniel Hudson in the eighth.	Backed by Ender Inciarte's second-inning RBI single, Anderson snapped a three-start winless stretch since his previous victory May 20 at Miami. He said he might have had a slight advantage facing the Giants for the first time.	"I was amazed that he hadn't faced them," manager Chip Hale said. "You could see him with a good focus out there, taking deep breaths, just concentrating on every pitch. To win 1-0 against the world champs is a feather in our hat."	Arizona didn't allow a runner past second and held on while outhitting San Francisco 11-2.	Three days after rookie Chris Heston pitched a no-hitter against the Mets in New York, the Giants were on the other end of a no-hit bid for much of the night.	Joe Panik had his career-best 15-game hitting streak snapped.	Bumgarner (7-3) allowed nine hits for his second-highest total of the season but lost for only the second time in his last 12 starts against Arizona. He struck out seven and walked three in eight innings, losing for the first time in six starts overall.	Bumgarner traveled back with the team on the overnight flight from New York despite manager Bruce Bochy and pitching coach Dave Righetti advising him to travel ahead of time. The team landed about 4:30 a.m. and reported later than usual to the ballpark Friday afternoon.	"He's hard-headed," Bochy said of his ace left-hander.	Bumgarner -- no surprise -- insisted he was unfazed.	"I got plenty of sleep and felt rested. My stuff was good," he said. "They keep hitting to where we weren't."	Duffy hit a leadoff single against Hudson in the eighth and advanced on a wild pitch. He was tagged out at third in a rundown after pinch-hitter Casey McGehee's grounder.	Brad Ziegler worked a perfect ninth for his seventh save as the Diamondbacks won for the fourth time in the last five against San Francisco.	Giants left fielder Nori Aoki threw out Paul Goldschmidt at the plate to end the third.	Aoki lined to Aaron Hill at third base for an inning-ending double play in the bottom half.	"That's just a reaction, that happened so fast," Hill said. "It worked out. That was probably a double down the line."	The Giants' home skid is their longest since dropping seven in a row in May 2008.	BOCHY'S BEEF	Bochy reiterated again how frustrated he is that the Giants had to play a night game at the Mets on Thursday before flying cross-country. He hopes the players' union will take a stand regarding the schedule.	The Giants annually have among the highest total of air miles traveled.	"I think we're dropping the ball here," Bochy said, noting the risk for injury. "Hopefully we'll fix this. I certainly don't think ticket sales should play a part in it."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Giants: RF Hunter Pence was placed on the 15-day disabled list with tendinitis in his left wrist, a move retroactive to June 3. He was scheduled to be re-evaluated by team doctors. ... OF Gregor Blanco's dizziness is subsiding from a concussion that has sidelined him since Wednesday.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: After the game, Arizona announced RHP Josh Collmenter is being moved to the bullpen and RHP Allen Webster will be called up from Triple-A Reno to pitch Saturday against San Francisco. Collmenter (3-6) originally was scheduled to start the game.	Giants: RHP Ryan Vogelsong (4-4) looks for his first win against Arizona this year and just the fourth of his career in 17 starts.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

BOSTON --  Once again, Russell Martin got the go-ahead hit for the Toronto Blue Jays. Then again, most everyone seems to be getting big hits for them lately.	Martin hit a leadoff home run in the 11th inning and the Blue Jays won their 10th straight game, beating the Boston Red Sox 5-4 Saturday.	"We've seen him do it so many times this year," Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. "You're winning a lot of games and it always makes it easier to show up. That's natural."	The winning streak is the Blue Jays' longest since they took 11 in a row in June 2013. And it followed a three-game losing streak that dropped their record to 23-30 and left them competing with the Red Sox to stay out of last place in the AL East.	Now, Toronto is 1 1-2 games off the lead while Boston is 7 1-2 back, in last place, after losing its fifth straight and falling a season-worst nine games under .500 at 27-36.	"We've got to show up tomorrow and play," Red Sox star Dustin Pedroia said. "We're all grown men. We can't start crying."	On Friday night, Martin hit a tiebreaking, bases-loaded triple during a nine-run burst in the seventh for a 13-10 victory. On Saturday, he drove a 2-0 fastball down the middle from Matt Barnes (2-2) deep into the left-center field stands for his 10th homer of the season.	But Martin recalled two earlier at-bats Saturday when he didn't come through on fastballs with counts of 2-0 and 3-0.	"Fool me once, fool me twice," he said, "but the third time I'm going to get you."	It capped a rough day behind the plate for Martin, who had three passed balls trying to snag R.A. Dickey's especially lively knuckler.	"At the end of a long day, get that big home run when we needed it," Gibbons said. "That's what he does."	Brett Cecil pitched a perfect 11th for his fourth save, and second in two days, to preserve the win for Aaron Loup (2-3).	Toronto took a 3-0 lead in the second when it loaded the bases on singles by its first three batters -- Edwin Encarnacion, Chris Colabello and Martin. Any possibility of a repeat of Friday night's nine-run inning, when the first nine hitters scored before a batter was out, ended when Justin Smoak struck out.	But Kevin Pillar followed with an RBI single and Ryan Goins hit a two-run single.	The Blue Jays went ahead 4-0 in the fourth on consecutive singles by Pillar, Goins and Jose Reyes. Then they managed just three hits, all singles, in the next six innings.	The Red Sox began their comeback against Dickey with three runs in the fourth on an RBI single by Xander Bogaerts and a two-run single by Pablo Sandoval. They tied it in the sixth on David Ortiz's eighth homer of the season.	Boston wasted a bases-loaded opportunity with one out in the seventh when Liam Hendriks struck out Ortiz and Bogaerts.	"Middle of the order and big opportunity," Boston manager John Farrell said. "We were unable to cash in on it."	Toronto prevented another run in the third when Jose Bautista leaped at the right-center field fence in front of Boston's bullpen to take a potential leadoff homer away from Rusney Castillo.	TALENTED TWIRLER	Dickey retired 10 of his last 11 batters and allowed three earned runs or fewer for his third straight start. In six innings, he gave up three earned runs, six hits and one walk with five strikeouts.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: DH Encarnacion played his fourth game since missing two with a painful left shoulder. He went 2 for 5 and is 6 for 15 since returning.	Red Sox: CF Mookie Betts missed the game with a sore back. He was hurt Friday night when he ran into the low fence near the Boston bullpen in right-center field while chasing Smoak's triple in the second. ... 3B Sandoval left Saturday's game in the top of the seventh with tightness in his right quadriceps. ... LF Hanley Ramirez started after missing Friday night's game with soreness in his left knee and left hamstring.	ON DECK	Blue Jays: RHP Marco Estrada (3-3, 3.78) tries to win his third straight start in the finale of the three-game series. He's allowed three runs or fewer in five of his last six starts.	Red Sox: Rookie sensation Eduardo Rodriguez (2-0, 0.44) makes his fourth start since being called up from Triple-A Pawtucket for his major league debut May 28. The lefty has allowed one run on eight hits with 21 strikeouts and seven walks in 20 2/3 innings.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Those impressive back-to-back home runs by Mitch Moreland and Joey Gallo came only after Shin-Soo Choo and Prince Fielder did their part for the Texas Rangers.	When Fielder hit what set up to be Minnesota's fourth consecutive inning-ending double play, Choo went hard into second base and Fielder busted down the line to beat the disrupted relay to first base.	"That kind of reflects when you start looking at our outcomes over the last month and a half," said Moreland, who immediately followed with a three-run homer in Texas' 11-7 win over the Twins. "We're playing hard, not taking any pitches off, we're going out there and trying to beat them every time."	Moreland pulled his shot an estimated 409 feet down the right-field line and Gallo then had a 461-foot drive into the upper deck, all in a tiebreaking six-run fourth that put Texas  ahead to stay in Colby Lewis' first career win over the Twins.	"The big play was not completing the 3-6-1 double play," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.	The Rangers have won 10 of 14 games and is 25-13 since May 4, the best record and most wins in the majors during that span.	"To run down the line hard, to go into second base hard, to give you an opportunity to send another hitter to the plate, it's huge," first-year Rangers manager Jeff Banister said. "It's an identifying trait of a ball club that wants to win."	Minnesota has lost five games in a row after starting the week as the AL Central leader. The Twins were without outfielder Torii Hunter, who dropped the appeal of his two-game suspension for an equipment-throwing rant and started serving the penalty.	The Twins on Sunday will add top prospect Byron Buxton from Double-A Chattanooga. Molitor said the 21-year-old Buxton will make his big league debut playing center field.	Moreland's homer chased Mike Pelfrey (5-3), who allowed eight runs and 11 hits in 3 2/3 innings after giving up only three runs over 28 innings his previous four starts.	"I was just terrible," said Pelfrey, whose season ERA shot from 2.28 to 3.18. "It was just one of those days that nothing's working. I got my tail kicked."	The Twins were the only AL team Lewis (6-3) hadn't beaten as a Ranger. The 35-year-old in his 10th major league season had been 0-5 in 11 career appearances, seven of those starts. He retired the last 15 batters he faced, and didn't return after a one-hour, 19-minute rain delay in the seventh.	After Minnesota scored three times in the third on consecutive doubles, Lewis struck out the next three hitters. He got out of the fourth on just seven pitches.	"For me it's damage control," Lewis said. "They went out there and scored me one run and they rallied back right after that and scored three off me. ... I've got to keep it close. That's it."	Choo had three RBI with his three hits. Delino DeShields had two doubles and scored three times.	Gallo's homer is the fourth-longest ever at the Rangers' home ballpark. Josh Hamilton hit a 490-footer in 2010, Jose Canseco a 480-footer in the ballpark's 1994 debut season and Moreland had a 463-foot shot three years ago.	"I'm not going to talk too much trash to him because I think he'll probably hit one farther than that before the year is over with," Moreland said. "What he can do is pretty special."	It was the third homer for Gallo, the rookie third baseman's first since June 2/3 when he was the first Rangers player ever to homer in each of its first two career games.	LOT OF EXTRA BASES	Both teams had seven extra-base hits, the first MLB game this season that happened. All of Minnesota's were doubles, the first time with that many since July 26, 2010. The Twins led 3-1 in the third after Eddie Rosario had a two-run double and scored on Joe Mauer's two-bagger. They added four doubles in a four-run ninth inning.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Twins: Aaron Hicks was removed from the starting lineup after Molitor said the center fielder "had some trouble with his right elbow" when hitting in the batting cage. Molitor said he couldn't swing the bat or throw.	Rangers: LHP Martin Perez (Tommy John surgery) has been pulled from his rehab assignment after tweaking his left groin in his first start Wednesday for Double-A Frisco. The Rangers called the move precautionary.	UP NEXT	Twins: Phil Hughes (4-5, 4.81) makes his Twins-high 13th start after losing his last two.	Rangers: Nick Martinez (5-2, 2.65) has allowed two earned runs or less in eight of his 12 starts. By starting Sunday, the former college second baseman isn't in line to pitch in a two-game series at the Los Angeles Dodgers when pitchers get to hit.	MORE FOR MORELAND	Moreland had an RBI double in the third that tied the game at 3. He was also credited before the game with a two-run double after a scoring change from Friday night when his ball to center field that broke a 2-all tie had originally been ruled an error in the Rangers' 6-2 victory.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

PITTSBURGH --  Gerrit Cole lacked his best stuff. The way things are going for the rapidly maturing Pittsburgh Pirates ace, he doesn't need it to get by.	And for a day, neither did Pittsburgh's normally reliable bullpen.	Cole allowed two runs in six innings to become the first pitcher in the majors to 10 victories this season after reliever Tony Watson escaped a precarious eighth inning as Pirates edged the Philadelphia Phillies 4-3 on Saturday.	Cole (10-2) struck out seven without a walk to trim his ERA to a major-league best 1.71 while winning his fifth consecutive start. The 24-year-old improved to 14-2 dating to last September when closer Mark Melancon worked a perfect ninth for his 20th save.	"We've played really, really well out there as a unit every time I've stepped on the hill," Cole said. "Whether that has to do with my performance, I'm not quite sure. I think it has to do with the mentality that we bring."	A mentality that sits just fine with the hyper-intense Cole. He gave up a leadoff hit in each of the first four innings but settled down to retire the final nine batters he faced.	"He's learning how to pitch now and he has an idea of what he wants to do and how to do it," Pirates third baseman Josh Harrison said. "He's dangerous."	The Phillies wasted a chance to tie the game in the eighth off Watson. Ben Revere led off with a double and scored on a pinch-hit single by Jeff Francoeur to pull Philadelphia within one. The Phillies then loaded the bases with no outs, only to come up with nothing. Maikel Franco and Cody Asche hit into force plays at home and Freddy Galvis ended the threat with a routine grounder to second.	"We put ourselves in a good situation to not only tie but possibly win," Philadelphia manager Ryne Sandberg said. "It's a situation where young players were up there and it's something that they'll experience and grow from."	Starling Marte had three hits and an RBI for Pittsburgh. Gregory Polanco added two hits and Andrew McCutchen drove in two runs as Pittsburgh handed the Phillies their ninth straight road loss	Sean O'Sullivan (1-5) muddled through six innings, walking four with just one strikeout.	Revere got three hits for the Phillies and Franco and Galvis each had two. Philadelphia went 1 for 13 with runners in scoring position and has dropped eight of nine overall.	Philadelphia actually hit Cole harder than the Pirates hit O'Sullivan, but Pittsburgh took advantage of the few opportunities it was given. The Pirates scored a pair of runs in the first when the Phillies twice unsuccessfully tried to throw out the lead runner on a fielder's choice. They added two more in the second on a single, a walk and two infield hits by Marte and McCutchen.	Staked to a 4-1 lead, Cole dug in. Franco doubled leading off the fourth and scored on a groundout by Galvis in the fourth but Cole would not allow another baserunner as the Pirates won their third straight and improved to 21-11 since May 9, the best record in the majors.	"We didn't really just turn it on," Cole said. "We grinded through awhile of some pretty bad baseball. It wasn't like it was a one-game turnaround. It speaks to how we go about our business and you know weather the storm."	WORKED UP	Philadelphia reliever Ken Giles is an emotional guy. Those emotions got the best of him during Friday night's 1-0, 13-inning loss when Giles drew Sandberg's ire for his actions during an eventful inning of work. Giles committed a throwing error, then became animated when ordered to intentionally walk Pedro Alvarez. Giles eventually escaped a bases-loaded jam when he struck out Jordy Mercer to end the eighth. The right-hander waved at Mercer as if shooing him back to the dugout. Sandberg took exception and confronted Giles in the aftermath, leading to a heated exchange in which neither player or manager held back. Giles admitted he got "a little too fired up" when the call for an intentional walk came in.	"I'm just out there to compete," Giles said. "I don't like giving freebies. I understand the situation of the game. I just don't like giving freebies. That's about it."	Giles promised it wouldn't happen again and isn't concerned about it becoming an issue with Sandberg.	"We settled that right after the game," he said. "Everything's buried in the dirt. Nothing to worry about."	UP NEXT	The series concludes on Sunday when Pittsburgh's A.J. Burnett (6-2, 2.11 ERA) faces Cole Hamels (5-5, 3.11). Burnett -- who spent last season with the Phillies before turning down a player option to return in 2015, opting to sign with the Pirates instead -- earned a 7-2 decision against Philadelphia on May 12. Hamels is 3-2 with a 2.73 ERA in eight career starts against Pittsburgh and gave up two runs in seven innings of a victory over the Pirates on May 13.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DETROIT --  Carlos Carrasco and the Cleveland Indians spoiled the return of Detroit Tigers starter Justin Verlander.	Carlos Santana homered and Carrasco shook off a bad history in Detroit to lift the Indians to a 5-4 victory Saturday.	Carrasco (8-5), who started the game 1-4 with a 9.45 ERA in six outings at Comerica Park, struck out eight and allowed three runs and seven hits in 5 2/3 innings to help disappoint a sellout crowd that turned out for Verlander's season debut.	The former MVP and Cy Young award winner, who had been on the disabled list with a right triceps strain since the start of the season, left with a 3-2 lead after pitching five innings. But reliever Blaine Hardy (2-1) was tagged for two runs in the sixth that gave the Indians the lead for good.	Detroit's J.D. Martinez led off the eighth with a homer off Bryan Shaw before Cleveland's Cody Allen pitched the final 1 1/3 innings for his 14th save in 15 chances.	Verlander allowed one baserunner through the first three innings but gave up a homer to Santana to open the fourth. He loaded the bases with one out in the fifth but only allowed Jason Kipnis' sacrifice fly to keep the lead.	"We're really grateful to have him back," Martinez said. "It just looked like he was out there and he was throwing strikes, getting ahead of guys and making good pitches when he needed to.	"It was just unfortunate we couldn't get that win for him today but I think he pitched really well and I'm excited for the future for the rest of the season."	Verlander's hardest pitch was timed at 97 mph and manager Brad Ausmus said he thought about sending him back out for the sixth with his pitch count at 87.	"I think it was a good first outing, good first step and I'm sure as we move deeper into the season he's going to pitch longer, he's going to probably be sharper, maybe have an off day here or there," Ausmus said. "I think in fairly short order, he'll be back up to his 110-120 pitches."	Verlander, scheduled to make his second start Thursday at Cincinnati, was excited to return but added he felt a bit tired in the fifth.	"It was nice to be back out there. Felt good to be on a big-league mound. Felt pretty good overall," he said. "The rhythm wasn't quite there, but overall I felt pretty good. Hopefully, the body and arm respond well moving forward.	"I think it was just exerting more energy than I have yet. I wouldn't say that I was completely tired, but I could tell that I was putting more into it than I had at any point in my rehab."	Rajai Davis tripled to open the Tigers' first and came home on Miguel Cabrera's single. Carrasco loaded the bases later in the inning but escaped further trouble by striking out the next two batters.	"It was really important," Carrasco said of working out of the jam. "It's a tough lineup and I just follow every hit like it's my last and that worked today."	Martinez had an RBI double in the third and Davis added one in the fourth.	David Murphy tied the game in the sixth with an RBI triple that chased Hardy and Jan Gomes brought him home two pitches later with a sacrifice fly off Alex Wilson. Murphy scored his second run on Gomes' deep eighth-inning double.	Jose Iglesias and Anthony Gose had consecutive two-out singles in the eighth but Allen struck out Davis to keep the Indians ahead. Cabrera walked and got to third on Yoenis Cespedes' bloop single with one out in the ninth but Allen got Martinez to ground into a game-ending double play.	"Any team with a one-run lead and Miguel Cabrera at the plate is going to feel a little uneasy in the dugout," Murphy said. "It was awesome the way we finished it off there."	The Indians, shut out by David Price in Friday night's series opener, earned just their second win against their AL Central rivals and snapped the Tigers' three-game streak in the season series.	LINDOR'S TIME	The Indians plan to promote top prospect Francisco Lindor from Triple-A Columbus on Sunday. The 21-year-old shortstop was a first-round draft pick in 2011.	REHAB FOR MARTINEZ	Tigers DH Victor Martinez is scheduled to begin a rehab assignment Sunday with Triple-A Toledo. Ausmus said Martinez will play at least four games with the Mud Hens before he's evaluated further.	Martinez has been bothered by the effects of offseason knee surgery and was placed on the 15-day DL on May 19 after hitting .216 with one homer and 15 RBI in 34 games. He finished second in last season's AL MVP voting after hitting .335 with 103 RBI and a career-best 32 homers.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cleveland: The Indians activated RHP Scott Atchison from the DL on Saturday. He had been out since May 28 with an ankle sprain. The club optioned RHP C.C. Lee to Triple-A Columbus to create a roster spot.	Detroit: RHP Bruce Rondon allowed an earned run and two hits with two strikeouts in an inning Friday night with Toledo. Ausmus said the reliever, who began the season on the DL with tendinitis in his pitching arm, will be evaluated after throwing Sunday.	UP NEXT	Cy Young winner Corey Kluber (3-6, 3.61) gets the ball for Cleveland in Sunday's series finale. He'll face RHP Alfredo Simon (6-3, 2.76).	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MILWAUKEE -- Bryce Harper says taking a 95 mph fastball off his left knee was no fun. Everything else about the Washington Nationals' performance Saturday gave him a reason to smile.	Yunel Escobar and Wilson Ramos hit two-run homers and Harper continued his offensive surge by driving in two runs as the Nationals beat the Milwaukee Brewers 7-2.	"We're a great team. I think everybody knows that. I've been preaching all year in the media, in the clubhouse, that we've got one of the best lineups in baseball," said Harper, who was pulled as a precaution after being hit in the ninth inning by Michael Blazek's errant fastball. "When we do the things we need to do, we're going to score a lot of runs."	Add in the effort of rookie Joe Ross (1-1) and the Nationals look just like the NL East favorites, not a scuffling team that came in losers of 11 of 14 and in danger of falling to .500 for the first time since May 8.	The 22-year-old Ross scatted seven hits in eight solid innings, and got a celebratory shower of chocolate sauce for his efforts.	"Towards the end I definitely had more adrenaline pumping so it wasn't like I felt as tired as I probably am now," Ross said. "I felt good, I'll probably be a little sore tomorrow, but I feel good."	It was just the type of performance the struggling Nationals needed from its 3-4-5 hitters, who went 7-of-13 with six RBIs and chased starter Jimmy Nelson (3-7) in the sixth.	Escobar's homer put Washington ahead for good 3-2 in the third and Ramos' shot extended the lead to 5-2 in the fifth. Harper finished 3-for-3 with a walk to raise his average to .343 and garnered his 50th and 51st RBIs with singles in the first and sixth.	"He's just taking what they're giving them. It's flat, it's level, it's controlled baseball for him," Nationals manager Matt Williams said. "It's important for him. If he does that then you see what can happen."	Harper said he would decide if he would play Sunday based on how he felt when he gets to the ballpark.	It was the first time the Nationals had ever faced Nelson. It didn't take long for them to figure him out.	Harper opened the scoring with a sharp RBI single to left in the first, then set the stage in the fifth with two outs by battling back from an 0-2 count. He took two close pitches to earn a walk as Nelson grimaced at plate umpire Tim Timmons' calls.	"I mean, whether I thought they were [strikes] or not doesn't really matter," Nelson said. "I still have to execute my pitches after that, and I didn't."	That set up Ramos, whose home run just beyond the fence in right field landed with a loud thud off the picnic area awning.	"When we get opportunities to bring runners in and we do it, we have an opportunity to win a lot of games," Ramos said. "I felt more relaxed at the plate. I got a good pitch to hit, and I did."	ESPINOSA ALL OVER	Danny Espinosa made his first career start at first base for the Nationals.	Espinosa has played third base, left field and now first base this season for the first time in his six-year career after previously only playing middle infield positions.	With Ryan Zimmerman (plantar fasciitis) on the DL, Espinosa looked like a natural making all the necessary plays in the field.	TRAINING ROOM	Nationals: RHP Doug Fister (forearm tightness) threw six scoreless innings in a rehab start with Double-A Harrisburg on Friday night. He's expected to throw a bullpen session before rejoining the Nationals next week. Williams says a bullpen session is also RHP Stephen Strasburg's next step after throwing a simulated game Friday. Strasburg (neck) was placed on the 15-day DL on May 30.	Brewers: CF Carlos Gomez (right hip) was back in the lineup after missing three games. He went 0-for-4. Brewers LF Gerardo Parra came up hobbled in the second inning after fouling a ball off his right shin just above his protective guard, but stayed in the game.	UP NEXT	Nationals: Max Scherzer (6-5, 2.13 ERA) takes the mound in the series finale. The right-hander has gone at least six innings in every start this year, but has faltered in his past two outings -- giving up a combined eight runs in two losses. The slump followed a dominant five-game winning streak where he gave up just seven runs over 36 innings.	Brewers: Milwaukee counters with rookie Taylor Jungmann, who will look to build on a strong outing in a win Tuesday in Pittsburgh. The 2011 first-round draft pick's breakout performance was a surprise following a slow start to the season in Triple-A Colorado Springs. "You feel good giving him the ball. That's the big thing," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

HOUSTON --  Seattle Mariners manager Lloyd McClendon wasn't celebrating his team's 8-1 victory over the Houston Astros on Saturday.	He was unhappy that the Mariners didn't add to their lead after piling up eight runs in the first three innings.	"The bottom line is ...  we had opportunities after those eight runs and we didn't do as well as we could have," McClendon said. "It's my job as the manager of this club, even when we win ballgames, to point out the things that we need to do better at."	Logan Morrison homered twice and tied a career high with five RBI for the Mariners.	The Mariners jumped on Collin McHugh (6-3) for five runs in the first inning, a day after Houston roughed up Seattle's Felix Hernandez for eight runs in the opening frame in a 10-0 win on Friday night.	Morrison connected for his first homer since May 12, a two-out, three-run shot in the first that made it 5-0.	He didn't have to wait long for another one, launching a two-run drive in the third to almost the exact same spot in right-center field. It was the third multihomer run game of his career.	Rookie starter Mike Montgomery (1-1) allowed six hits and one run while walking three in six innings. He became the second player in franchise history to pitch at least six innings while allowing two earned runs or fewer in each of his first three career starts and the first since Bob Stoddard in 1981.	McHugh allowed nine hits and tied a career high with eight runs in a season-low three innings.	"It's frustrating because my stuff is not very sharp right now, but my body feels good, my arm feels good," McHugh said. "I feel good in between starts."	It was a rare offensive outburst for the Mariners, who entered the game last in the American League in runs scored and they had scored three runs or fewer in 15 of their last 16 games.	"It's unrealistic to think it's going to happen every day, but at the same time it has to happen more often for us," Morrison said. "We have a great team. We know it. We've got to find a way to be more consistent, not only with our at-bats but with our production. Hopefully this is a step in the right direction."	The Astros were without All-Star second baseman Jose Altuve, who sat out with a strained right hamstring after injuring it Friday. He is listed as day to day.	Morrison extended his hitting streak at Minute Maid Park to 18 games and Saturday was his first five-RBI game since June 19, 2012.	The Mariners got things going with a single by Austin Jackson with one out in the first. Robinson Cano followed with a double and a single by Nelson Cruz made it 1-0. Kyle Seager had a sacrifice fly, Mark Trumbo singled and Morrison homered.	Jackson's RBI single in the third inning pushed the lead to 8-0.	The Astros, who have scored two runs or fewer in seven of their last nine games, made it 8-1 on an RBI double by George Springer in the fifth.	Roberto Hernandez, who has started 11 games this season, struck out five in four scoreless innings for the Astros in his first relief appearance this year after McHugh's early exit.	Danny Farquhar, who was recalled from Triple-A Tacoma on Saturday, walked two in two scoreless innings for the Mariners.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: Altuve probably won't play Sunday, but the Astros don't expect him to be out too long. ... Starter Brad Peacock (left intercostal strain) had a setback after a rehabilitation start at Double-A Corpus Christi and will return to Houston to be re-evaluated. "I feel bad for him," manager A.J. Hinch said. "I'm not sure what it means, and I don't want to rush to too many judgments until we talk to him. To have this rehab stint interrupted is certainly not something he wants or something we want."	UP NEXT	Houston rookie Lance McCullers opposes LHP Roenis Elias when the teams wrap up the three-game series on Sunday. McCullers has 36 strikeouts in his first five starts to tie a franchise record for most strikeouts in a player's first five games.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

NEW YORK --  Cameron Maybin bobbled a ball in center field for an error that allowed the Mets to score the go-ahead run in the seventh, and he got thrown out at home trying to tag up an inning later.	All good. He still had two at-bats to turn around his day.	Oh, he did.	Maybin had a two-run single in the 11th inning after driving in a run in the ninth Saturday, and the Atlanta Braves' beleaguered bullpen shut down the Mets over the final four-plus innings in a come-from-behind, 5-3 victory over New York.	"It's just fun to win, man," Maybin said.	Maybin came up with runners on second and third and one out in the 11th and sent a liner off Carlos Torres (2-3) into left-center for the two-run lead. He entered the day batting .448 (13 for 29) with runners in scoring position.	Facing a Mets bullpen without closer Jeurys Familia, whose son was born while he was finishing off Friday night's win, the Braves rallied for two in the ninth to end a five-game skid against the NL East leaders.	"Those guys went out and gave everything they had," Carlos Torres said, "for me to give up those runs after they played hard core is terrible."	Andrelton Simmons tied a career high with four hits for the Braves, who won for just the fourth time in 11 games.	With 37,794 enthusiastic fans standing and cheering, Freddie Freeman tied it 3-all with a liner past diving shortstop Wilmer Flores. Maybin singled in a run off Hansel Robles before Freeman stepped to the plate.	Freeman gave Atlanta the early lead with a mammoth homer off Jacob deGrom in the first.	The Braves had already blown five saves in June, but, this time, six relievers retired 14 of the final 16 batters.	Jason Grilli (2-2) pitched one inning for the win.	"We believe in these guys every time they come in," Maybin said of the bullpen. "They continue to go out there and they continue to compete."	Williams Perez, who is Monday's scheduled starter, gave up two singles to open the 11th before getting pinch-hitter John Mayberry Jr. to line into a double play to shortstop. Perez then finished for his first career save.	"We had no other options," manager Fredi Gonzalez said.	Gonzalez said he and his staff will have to go over Williams' day -- how many warmup pitches he threw and such before deciding if he will make his start against the Red Sox.	The Mets used several defensive gems and took advantage of an error by center fielder Maybin in the seventh inning to open a 3-1 lead against Shelby Miller.	New York had runners on base in every inning but the fourth against the Braves' 24-year-old ace. Miller, though, worked out of every jam until the seventh, when Travis d'Arnaud blooped a single to center. Pinch-hitter Juan Lagares, who singled to start the rally and advanced to third on Curtis Granderson's double, scored to make it 1-all.	Granderson scored when Maybin bobbled the ball in center field for an error. Dana Eveland replaced Miller and Lucas Duda then doubled.	In 6 1/3 innings, Miller allowed a season-high eight hits and three runs, which boosted his ERA from 1.84 to 2.02.	DeGrom pitched seven dominant innings, striking out nine. He allowed five hits and one run.	He also knocked down Maybin's sharp comebacker in the third and threw home to nail Simmons trying to score, keeping it 1-0.	Flores made a nifty stop, spin and throw to end the seventh with a runner on third. And Darrell Ceciliani, having just moved from center field to left, threw out Maybin at home trying to tag up on Freeman's fly in the eighth.	BOBBY'S BACK	Bobby Parnell made his first relief appearance in over a year because of Tommy John surgery. With two outs in the eighth he gave up a single and got a groundout to protect a 3-1 lead.	"I felt good mechanically there, but I've still got some work to do," Parnell said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: 2B Daniel Murphy (left quad strain) had six at-bats in an extended spring game. He did not run the bases.	UP NEXT	Braves: RHP Mike Foltynewicz was roughed up in his last start, allowing five runs and 12 hits against the Padres. He'll be making his ninth career start and first against the Mets.	Mets: Dillon Gee will make a spot start as part of New York's effort to manage its young starters' innings this season. Recently demoted to the bullpen, the right-hander's outing will give an extra day of rest to Matt Harvey, deGrom and Noah Syndergaard. Gee is 6-5 with a 3.09 ERA in 16 starts against the Braves.

From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

ST. LOUIS --  Jason Heyward closed his eyes in the bright glare of the sun, dropped slowly to the turf on his backside, and hoped for the best.	The St. Louis Cardinals right fielder made the key defensive play against the cross-state rival Kansas City Royals strictly by feel, preserving an eighth-inning lead by snaring a sinking liner by Kendrys Morales.	"I saw it off the bat and that was the last time I saw it until I went to throw it in," Heyward said after the 3-2 victory on Saturday. "I felt it hit my glove and I was surprised when it hit my glove."	The catch for the second out of the eighth with a man on was certainly deflating for the visitors.	"That was a lucky catch," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "I mean, there's some skill involved with that, but if you watch the replay he wasn't even looking.	"That's when you start thinking, `Whoa, we may be in trouble here."	Call-up Tyler Lyons had a solid outing and Mark Reynolds hit the go-ahead homer in the fifth for the Cardinals, who held the Royals' offense down for the second straight day.	"I figured it was either out or it was going to be a can of corn," Reynolds said. "So I just jogged anyway."	Alex Gordon and Salvador Perez homered for the Royals, who took two of three from the Cardinals at home last month and will be trying to avoid a sweep in the finale. The series matches teams with the best records in each league and the Royals have been held to two runs and 10 hits.	"Sometimes you go through slumps like this," Gordon said. "But we'll get out of it."	Matt Carpenter and Jason Heyward added an RBI each for St. Louis, which is a major league-best 41-21 overall and 24-7 at home. The Cardinals used five relievers over the last four innings to hold a one-run lead with Trevor Rosenthal getting the last four outs for his league-leading 21st save in 22 chances.	The Royals' eighth did not lack for dramatics. Rosenthal rallied from a 3-0 count to get Gordon on an infield popup with two on for the third out.	The first two games were sellouts, giving the Cardinals 13 on the year. Most of announced attendance of 45, 981 stuck around after a 24-minute rain delay before the top of the sixth.	Lyons (1-0) allowed two runs and three hits. He failed to make an impression in three starts earlier in the year in place of injured Adam Wainwright, entering with a 5.54 ERA, but fared much better replacing injured Lance Lynn.	Gordon's eighth homer gave the Royals the lead in the second and Perez tied it at 2 with his 10th homer in the fourth.	The Cardinals scored two runs on five hits in the third, a rally that began with Kolten Wong's leadoff triple. Reynolds' fourth homer, in the fifth off Jeremy Guthrie (4-4), snapped a 2-all tie.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals: LHP Jason Vargas (forearm strain) was placed on the 15-day DL.	UP NEXT	Chris Young moves up a day to start the series finale for Kansas City. He took a no-hitter into the seventh his last time out. John Lackey is 6-1 with a 2.02 ERA in 11 career starts at Busch Stadium, including 4-1 with a  1.73 ERA this year.	TACTICAL PLAY	Both teams played the infield in with a man on third and one out in the first and didn't get burned. The Cardinals clicked again in the sixth, helping to preserve the lead, when Matt Belisle got Salvador Perez on a broken-bat groundout.	WEAK PRAISE	Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said Lynn was the pitcher who had made the most improvement at the plate "by far -- mostly because he couldn't have gotten much worse." Lynn is batting .182 with one RBI after entering the year a career .065 hitter.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

MIAMI --  Looking to add an experienced starting pitcher in the offseason, the Miami Marlins believed Mat Latos was the answer. However, Latos battled through injuries and inconsistency in his first nine starts before going n the disabled list with left knee inflammation.	Latos (2-4) made his return on Saturday against the Colorado Rockies after three weeks in between starts and struck out a season-high 11 batters in seven innings to help lead the Marlins to a 4-1 win.	"He threw some cutters that they were swinging over by a foot," Marlins manager Dan Jennings said. "It's good to see him at 100 percent because I think you're truly seeing now the Mat Latos the Marlins traded for and it's a huge boost for us."	Latos gave up one run and four hits while making his first start since May 21. He earned his first victory since May 5 at Washington.	"It feels good to have two legs under me that's for sure," Latos said.	Latos was helped by Giancarlo Stanton, who homered and drove in four runs.	"That God I'm not pitching against him," Latos said.	Stanton had a two-run double in the first and a two-run home run, his 23rd, in the sixth to give him 12 RBI in the last six games.	"Just finally feeling comfortable, not being tense up there, and staying relaxed," Stanton said.	The Marlins only needed four hits and held the Rockies to five to win their third straight in the series.	"This is one of the worst hitters' parks in baseball in my opinion," Rockies catcher Michael McKenry said.	Latos was sharp from the beginning, striking out the first two batters in the first and then striking out the side in the fifth. The 11 strikeouts were the most for Latos since also getting 11 on July 6, 2013, against Seattle while with Cincinnati. It was his 10th career game with at least 10 strikeouts.	"Everything just felt strong, everything was going for me and I was able to make some good pitches, execute some good off-speed pitches, had good movement on my two-seamer today, had good command of both sides of the late with the fastball," Latos said.	A.J. Ramos pitched a perfect ninth for his eighth save in 11 chances.	David Hale (2-1) allowed four runs in six innings for the Rockies, who have lost four straight.	"We're certainly having a difficult time right now," Rockies manager Walt Weiss said.	Stanton made an immediate impact on the game in the first inning. He made a sliding catch in foul territory on a fly ball to right by Troy Tulowitzki to end the top half, and followed with his two-run double high off the left-center field wall for a 2-0 lead.	D.J. LeMahieu led off the sixth with a double, stole third, and scored on a base hit by Tulowitzki, who extended his hitting streak to 12 games.	Miami's Marcell Ozuna had his 13-game hitting streak snapped with an 0-for-4 performance.	Stanton's two-run homer to left gave the Marlins a 4-1 lead. It was his second four-RBI game of the series and third of the season.	The announced attendance of 26,647 included 389 dogs.	GALARRAGA MAKES APPEARANCE	Former Rockies All-Star and fan favorite Andres Galarraga spoke with players and coaches before the game, including Weiss, a teammate for six seasons.	"One of the best teammates I ever had," Weiss said. "I actually think I spent more time with him than any other player in my career. Great player, great person, brought a great attitude to the park every day. He was a pleasure to be around for all of those years. What a great person. He smiles 24/7 and he's like that when he played too."	POWER ON DISPLAY	Marlins' 17-year-old first-round draft pick Josh Naylor took part in batting practice and showed his power from the left side smacking five balls into the upper deck in right field.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rockies: LF Corey Dickerson left the game in the sixth after re-aggravating a left foot injury after grounding out. "I'm not exactly sure how serious it is, but it is a chronic thing," Weiss said. "Hopefully, it didn't flare up too much."	Marlins: RHP Jose Fernandez threw five scoreless innings in his second rehab start with Single-A Jupiter on Friday. "Wow, it was pretty good," Jennings said. Fernandez's next rehab start will be with either Single-A Jupiter or Double-A Jacksonville.	UP NEXT	Rockies: LHP Jorge De La Rosa (3-2, 5.53 ERA) will be looking for his franchise-best 73rd career victory in the series finale.	Marlins: RHP Dan Haren (6-2, 3.12) has a career ERA of 5.12 in 19 starts against the Rockies, his third-highest against any club. His nine losses are tied for the most.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  The Tampa Bay Rays used some hustle and a little luck to rally for their latest win.	Steven Souza Jr., tied the score with a two-out RBI single in the eighth inning, stole second with the help of a replay challenge, and scored the winning run on an error to lift the Rays to a 5-4 victory over the Chicago White Sox for their 10th win in 14 games.	Souza's two-out single off Zach Putnam (1-2) drove in David DeJesus, who had singled and stole second. Souza then swiped second -- after initially being called out -- and Asdrubal Cabrera was walked intentionally before Jake Elmore hit a bouncer up the middle.	Shortstop Alexei Ramirez fielded Elmore's grounder, but made a wild throw while trying to get the out at second. Souza rounded third and scored the tiebreaking run without seeing the errant throw.	"(Third base coach Charlie Montoya) just kept waving me and I just kept going," said Souza.	Ramirez's error was the only one of the game.	"The ball gets stuck in your glove. It happens," said Mark Parent, who is managing the White Sox this weekend while Robin Ventura attends his daughter's graduation. "It just seems that things like that happen too often, not just to him but a lot of us.	Tampa Bay had a 3-2 lead before pinch-hitter Conor Gillaspie connected for a two-run shot against Rays reliever Brad Boxberger (4-3) in the eighth. It was Gillaspie's third of the season.	The first pinch homer of the year for Chicago came after Chris Archer walked pinch-hitter Adam Eaton. Archer's first walk in four starts came on his last pitch of the game, but the right-hander said he was not disappointed at getting taken out, even though he had retired 10 straight before the walk.	"If I don't walk that guy, then we're not even having this discussion," said Archer, who said he was 100 percent happy with the outcome. "This shows you why we're in the position we're in. We pitch well enough and we get timely hitting."	Jake McGee worked the ninth for his third save.	Tampa Bay grabbed a 3-2 lead in the seventh. Nick Franklin had a one-out triple to right and pinch-hitter Logan Forsythe followed with a chopper to shortstop against a drawn-in infield. Ramirez bobbled the ball briefly, and then threw to first for the out as Franklin scored.	Chicago starter Jeff Samardzija pitched seven solid innings. He allowed three runs and six hits with seven strikeouts and one walk.	Archer gave up five hits and struck out five. His walk was the first he had issued since May 22 against Oakland. Archer had faced 107 batters in the interim, striking out 43 in the stretch.	Boxberger has given up three home runs in his last eight appearances after giving up none in his first 18.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: John Jaso, who has not played since opening day, batted in a cage and worked out at first base and in the outfield, all for the first time since sustaining a left wrist contusion.	UP NEXT	Chicago's Chris Sale (6-2) will attempt to become the first pitcher since Pedro Martinez in 2001 to strike out 12 or more batters in four consecutive starts Sunday, opposing Tampa Bay's Nathan Karns (3-3).	PUCK PRESENCE	A white Chicago Blackhawks jersey hung in the clubhouse of the White Sox, while several blue Tampa Bay Lightning jerseys were visible in the Rays clubhouse, all in recognition of Game 5 of the NHL'S Stanley Cup Final being played 20 miles away Saturday night.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BALTIMORE --  The Baltimore Orioles are healthy, hitting and consistently winning.	Manny Machado homered and had four RBI, Nolan Reimold hit a two-run drive and the Orioles overcame a milestone achievement by Alex Rodriguez in a 9-4 victory over the New York Yankees on Saturday night.	David Lough added a solo shot for the Orioles, who have won six straight to climb over .500 (31-30) for the first time since May 4. Baltimore was 23-29 and tied for last place on June 3 before an 8-1 run moved the team within two games of the AL East lead.	"We finally got pieces coming back and the team's playing well," Machado said. "We are finally playing as a team."	The return of catcher Matt Wieters and pitcher Bud Norris, along with the addition of Reimold from the minor league system, helped right the defending division champions.	Baltimore has amassed 20 runs and 31 hits in the first two games of this series and will vie for a sweep on Sunday.	"Guys are in a little bit of a flow," manager Buck Showalter said. "You've got a lot of different guys contributing."	Rodriguez hit a two-run homer to join Hank Aaron as the only members of the exclusive 2,000-RBI club. The sixth-inning drive off Norris lifted A-Rod's career RBI total to 2,001. Hank Aaron ranks first on the career list with 2,297.	It was the 666th career home run for Rodriguez, fourth on baseball's all-time list behind Babe Ruth, Aaron and Barry Bonds.	"You want to do these things and help the team win," Rodriguez said. "I won't be able to appreciate these things until years after I'm done playing anyway."	After Rodriguez tied the game, Baltimore went up 7-4 in the bottom half against Chris Martin (0-2) with an uprising fueled by three wild pitches. J.J. Hardy put the Orioles in front with an RBI single before Machado poked an opposite-field, two-run single to right.	Lough continued the onslaught with a pinch-hit homer in the seventh off Sergio Santos, who was brought up from the minors earlier in the day.	Chaz Roe (2-0) pitched 2 1/3 innings for Baltimore, part of a scoreless effort by the bullpen in relief of Norris.	"We feel really special to just pass off the ball to them and let them go to work," Norris said.	Yankees starter CC Sabathia allowed four runs and eight hits in five innings.	"My fastball command was not there," the left-hander said.	New York jumped to a 2-0 lead in the first inning when Mark Teixeira hit a two-out RBI single and scored on a double by Brian McCann.	After Machado led off the second with a single, Reimold hit a foul pop near the Baltimore dugout. Teixeira and McCann converged before deferring to each other as the ball dropped between them. Reimold drove the next pitch over the wall in right -- his second home run in four games since being recalled from the minors.	"Someone's got to make the catch, bottom line," manager Joe Girardi said.	The defensive gem of the game occurred in the fourth inning, when Yankees rookie center fielder Mason Williams chased down a liner in right-center and caught it before sliding into the wall.	Machado put the Orioles up 4-2 in the fifth with a two-run shot to center on a 3-1 pitch.	STREAKING	Yankees: New York has lost three straight for the first time since a six-game slide from May 17-24. Before their current skid, the Yankees won seven straight.	Orioles: Baltimore has won six straight for the fourth time since Showalter took over late in the 2010 season. The Orioles haven't won more than six straight since an eight-game streak in 2005.	TRAINERS ROOM	Yankees: Headley was back in the lineup at 3B after being drilled between the legs by a sharp grounder Friday night. ... RHP Ivan Nova (elbow) allowed one run in six innings in his second rehab start, this one for Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes Barre on Saturday night.	Orioles: 2B Jonathan Scoop (right knee) is slated to work out with the team Monday after spending several weeks in Florida. The team hopes for his return by early July.	ON DECK	Yankees: Adam Warren (4-4, 3.64 ERA) pitches Sunday in the series finale. He's allowed a HR in five straight games but has a 2.70 ERA during that span.	Orioles: Baltimore seeks its first three-game sweep of the Yankees since 2013 behind rookie Mike Wright (2-1, 2.96 ERA).	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO --  The Chicago Cubs had to wait out a lengthy rain delay, and then they had to overcome the Cincinnati Reds' rally.	Cubs manager Joe Maddon liked his team's resilience.	Starlin Castro's RBI single in the ninth inning lifted the Cubs to a 4-3 win over the Reds on Saturday night in a rain-delayed game.	Kris Bryant led off the ninth with a double before Miguel Montero was hit by a pitch to bring up Castro, who singled to center field off Tony Cingrani (0-3).	"We continue to play adverse circumstances with the weather. They came back," Maddon said. "We have opportunities, don't get it done, but don't cave. That's how you play in October."	Bryant keyed the Cubs rally and also impressed his manager with his legs. He dove head-first into second base on the double, and also scored on a fielder's choice grounder hit to shortstop in the fourth.	"Fabulous job on the bases," Maddon said.	Bryant said he tries to be a complete player.	"It's good a different part of my game showed today," he said.	Jason Motte (3-1) allowed two hits and struck out one in a scoreless ninth for the Cubs, who have won five of seven.	Eugenio Suarez tied the game for the Reds in the top of the sixth with a two-run home run off James Russell soon after the game was resumed from a 2-hour, 48-minute rain delay.	"We came out of that rain delay with a lot of intensity and fire," Reds manager Bryan Price said. "We really played those last four innings extremely hard, extremely well and made a game of it."	The Wrigley Field videoboards showed Game 5 of the Stanley Cup Final between the Chicago Blackhawks and Tampa Bay Lightning. At one point, fans were urged to seek shelter due to lightning. A fan ran onto the field after the Blackhawks took the lead and was caught in center field. Chicago won 2-1 to take a 3-2 series lead.	"We lost some momentum there coming off the rain delay," Bryant said. "We came back, battled. It was a strange day, but happy we got a `W."	Neither starting pitcher returned after the rain delay. Kyle Hendricks struck out seven in five innings. Mike Leake allowed five hits in five innings.	Montero hit a two-run home run, his ninth, on the first pitch he saw from Leake in the second. Montero has three home runs in four games.	Joey Votto's solo home run, his 14th, made it a one-run game in the fourth.	Bryant scored from third on the fielder's choice for a two-run lead in the fourth. He was initially ruled out at home on a throw from shortstop Suarez, but the call was overturned after a 3-minute, 55-second review.	"I got down the line pretty quick to get in there," Bryant said. "It was a good slide. I'm glad they overturned it. It ended up being a crucial run for us."	The Cubs had a chance to take the lead in the eighth. Addison Russell led off with a double, but was picked off when he slipped trying to get back to second after Dexter Fowler missed a bunt. The Cubs had runners at the corners after a reviewed Chris Coghlan single. Anthony Rizzo grounded into a double play to end the inning.	"We had opportunities, did not get it done and eventually had to do it like we did," Maddon said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: 2B Brandon Phillips (groin) remained out of the starting lineup for the third straight game. He pinch hit Friday and Saturday.	UP NEXT	Reds RHP Anthony DeSclafani (5-4, 3.53 ERA) will start against Cubs LHP Jon Lester (4-5, 4.25) in the series finale.	DURING THE BREAK	The Cubs also kept track of the Blackhawks during the delay. Bryant was impressed with the fan reaction.	"It's pretty cool to see that firsthand," he said. "I hope they would be doing that for us too."	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Allen Webster was a bit nervous making his Diamondbacks debut, and it showed when the Arizona right-hander walked two of the first four batters he faced.	A quick pep talk from longtime friend and catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia was all it took to settle him down.	Webster pitched into the sixth inning, Paul Goldschmidt had two hits and an RBI and the Diamondbacks beat the San Francisco Giants 4-2 on Saturday.	"I was still trying to feel it out and, I'm not going to lie, I definitely had the jitters," Webster said. "Once I came back into the dugout, Salty was able to settle me down and we got out there and got into a good rhythm together. We just rolled with it."	Webster, who spent the first two months in the minors after starting 11 games for Boston last season, was called up before the game and didn't allow a hit until Joe Panik's double with one out in the sixth. He gave up two runs and two hits with two strikeouts and three walks.	David Peralta and A.J. Pollock added two hits apiece for the Diamondbacks, who have won five of the last six against the defending World Series champs.	"(Webster) did a great job," Arizona manager Chip Hale said. "A lot of groundballs, and with this defense we have we're always comfortable with that. That's something we liked about him when we traded for him."	Buster Posey had an RBI double for San Francisco, which has lost seven straight at AT&T Park, its longest skid at home since 2008.	It's the second consecutive game in which an Arizona pitcher took a no-hitter into the sixth against San Francisco. Chase Anderson didn't allow a hit until the seventh inning of Friday's 1-0 win.	"The offense right now, we're out of synch," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said "The first five innings we looked dead."	Webster (1-0) walked two of the first four batters he faced then settled down to retire 14 straight before running into trouble in the sixth.	Nori Aoki drew a one-out walk and Panik doubled. Angel Pagan drove in Aoki with a sacrifice fly and Posey followed with an RBI double.	Three relievers completed the four-hitter. Brad Ziegler pitched the ninth for his eighth save.	The Diamondbacks drew four walks off Giants starter Ryan Vogelsong (4-5) in the first and gave Webster a three-run lead before he even took the mound.	David Peralta hit an RBI single while Saltalamacchia and Nick Ahmed both walked with the bases loaded to force in two runs.	"We're not the most patient team, and I think we recognized ... he just wasn't himself early," Hale said of Vogelsong. "He wasn't able to get the ball on those corners. Guys did a nice job letting him throw pitches and get on base."	Goldschmidt's two-out single in the fourth made it 4-0.	Vogelsong allowed six hits in 3 2/3 innings and had a season-high five walks.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: RHP J.C. Ramirez was designated for assignment. Ramirez was 1-1 with a 4.11 ERA in 12 appearances this season. ... RHP Enrique Burgos (shoulder tendinitis) is expected to begin a rehab assignment early next week.	Giants: RF Hunter Pence (wrist tendinitis) could resume baseball activities as early as next week. ... OF Gregor Blanco (concussion) is sleeping better but the team is still unsure when he'll return from the DL. ... RHP Jake Peavy (back strain) threw a bullpen session Saturday and will make a rehab start Tuesday in Sacramento. ... RHP Matt Cain (flexor tendon strain) will make his rehab start Monday in Sacramento as well.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: RHP Rubby De La Rosa (4-3) pitches the series finale and needs four strikeouts to set a career high. De La Rosa has fanned 71 batters in 74 innings this season.	Giants: RHP Chris Heston (6-4) will chase history when he attempts to become only the second pitcher in major league history to throw consecutive no-hitters. The San Francisco rookie, who no-hit the New York Mets in his previous start on June 9, looks to join Johnny Vander Meer almost 75 years after the Cincinnati Reds left-hander threw back-to-back no-hitters against the Boston Bees on June 11 and the Brooklyn Dodgers on June 15.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  A first-inning home run by Albert Pujols and two scoreless innings from the back of the Los Angeles Angels' bullpen amounted to all the support C.J. Wilson needed to get one of his most satisfying victories of the season.	Wilson pitched seven innings of two-hit ball, leading the Angels to a 1-0 victory over the Oakland Athletics on Saturday night. The only hits off him were a leadoff single in the first inning by Billy Burns and a two-out double in the fifth by Marcus Semien.	"Obviously there are a lot of guys in their lineup that have seen me a ton of times, and they've had so many at-bats against me that I had to be really, really careful," Wilson said. "When you have a one-run lead, you can't make any mistakes. So I was determined to pitch tough no matter what the count was and just try to get an out on every pitch."	Wilson (4-5) struck out eight and walked three in his first scoreless outing since April 7, when he allowed two hits over eight innings in a victory at Seattle.	"This was one of the harder games I've had to work through because I had to make so many pitches with the game on the line," Wilson said. "The fun games are the ones where you have a six-run lead, they roll over on everything and you cruise through it. This isn't fun. It's draining. It's a lot of work, but this is what you do all the work and preparation for and watch all the video."	The left-hander was 1/3 with a 6.00 ERA his previous five starts -- including a loss at Yankee Stadium last Sunday, when he gave up a season-worst six runs along with seven hits and three homers in seven innings.	Joe Smith pitched a perfect eighth and Huston Street got three outs for his 19th save in 21 attempts, one night after he needed 26 pitches to preserve a 5-4 victory against his former club.	Kendall Graveman (3-3) went the distance for the first time in nine major league starts, allowing eight hits and striking out eight without walking a batter. The 24-year-old right-hander threw 111 pitches, helping out manager Bob Melvin's battered bullpen. On April 20 in Anaheim, Graveman threw 73 pitches in three-plus innings and left with a 5-3 lead after walking his first two batters in the fourth.	Two nights after passing Mickey Mantle for 16th place on the all-time home run list, Pujols hit the 538th of his career and raised his RBI total to 1,636 -- tying Ernie Banks for 29th place on that list.	Pujols' drive into the left field bullpen gave him 18 homers for the season, tying Mike Trout for the club lead. The three-time NL MVP became the sixth player in Angels history to homer at least 10 times in a 15-game span, and the first since Mo Vaughn did it from May 8-25, 2000.	"I probably threw too many fastballs in that sequence. That's on me," Graveman said. "The first four innings we pitched one way and the last four we pitched a different way. After the fourth I was able to get some more off-balance swings and some that were off the barrel. So it was good to be able to do that. It was a good sign."	Wilson's biggest out came in the fifth, when he got Sam Fuld to chase an outside breaking pitch in the dirt for the third out after giving up a walk to Brett Lawrie and Semien's two-out double to left-center. Fuld, who came in 4 for 11 against Wilson with three RBI and no strikeouts, was in the starting lineup against a lefty for only the second time all season.	"In that situation, I just wanted to throw the ball on the fringes and not throw a meatball with guys on base," Wilson said. "I'd walked him early in the game, which I was extremely frustrated about because I was trying to throw him strikes. ... He's a line-drive hitter, so I'm trying to make sure he hits the ball either way up in the air or on the ground to someone."	Angels third baseman David Freese, who was kept out of the starting lineup the previous three games because of tightness in his right hamstring, was 2 for 3.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: RHP A.J. Griffin, who hasn't pitched for the club since undergoing Tommy John surgery, was reinstated from the 60-day disabled list and optioned to Triple-A Nashville. Closer Sean Doolittle (left shoulder strain) was transferred to the 60-day DL to clear a spot for Griffin on the 40-man roster.	Angels: OF Collin Cowgill (sprained right wrist) is scheduled to be examined by a specialist in next week in Arizona.	UP NEXT	Athletics: RHP Sonny Gray (7-3) is 4-1 with a 2.52 ERA in seven career starts against the Angels, including back-to-back wins in April. His 1.74 ERA through Friday was the second-best in the majors, and a percentage point behind Pittsburgh's Gerrit Cole.	Angels: RHP Matt Shoemaker (4-4) has allowed three earned runs in 18 2/3 innings over his last three starts. He is 0-3 with a 5.26 ERA in five home starts this season, including a 6-3 loss to the A's on April 20, when he worked three-plus innings and gave up home runs to Vogt and Marcus Semien.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

SAN DIEGO --  It was a classic matchup of two premier players and San Diego's Justin Upton simply got the best of Zack Greinke.	Upton hit a solo homer with two outs in the eighth inning off Greinke to give the Padres a 2-1 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Saturday night.	Upton has an excellent track record against the 2009 American League Cy Young Award winner, and it showed in the eighth.	"That's what makes the game fun, when you are in pressure situations," said Upton, a two-time all-star. "I think you ask most guys and they enjoy those situations."	Upton connected on a 3-2, hanging slider into the stands in left field for his ninth game-winning RBI this season.	"It was my first bad slider I threw all day," Greinke said. "When you make a mistake to him, he does damage."	Catcher Yasmani Grandal, a former Padre, said Greinke made "one mistake and he made it to the guy we shouldn't have. He has been the heart of their team all year."	Upton leads San Diego with 13 homers and 39 RBI. He has a .370 career batting average (10 for 27) with two homers against Greinke.	"These guys thrive on these moments, both ways," Padres manager Bud Black said. "Two high caliber players going toe to toe."	Dodgers manager Don Mattingly challenged the home run, contending a fan may have reached over the wall trying to catch the ball. But the call was upheld in 42 seconds.	Greinke, who came in 5-0 with a 1.53 ERA against San Diego in 10 career starts, had pitched well into the eighth inning.	The right-hander had allowed just one run and seven hits and had retired the first two batters of the inning before Upton homered.	Ian Kennedy matched Greinke through seven innings, allowing one run and four hits with four strikeouts and one walk. After breaking a string of four consecutive defeats with a 9.31 ERA, Kennedy turned in his third straight strong start.	Brandon Maurer (4-0) pitched a perfect eighth and Craig Kimbrel got the final three outs for his 16th save in 17 chances.	Kimbrel allowed a leadoff single to Yasiel Puig before getting Adrian Gonzalez to bounce into a double play and striking out Howie Kendrick.	The loss snapped the Dodgers' four-game winning streak.	The lack of support for Greinke was nothing new for the right-hander.  It was the sixth time in seven starts that Greinke has received two or fewer runs of support.	Despite the superb effort, Kennedy is winless in his last 12 starts against the Dodgers, going 0-7.	Grandal hit his seventh homer of the season leading off the third to tie the score at 1-all.	Matt Kemp put the Padres ahead in the first with a two-out, RBI single that scored Will Venable, who doubled.	WHERE AM I?	San Diego's Yonder Alonso, who has started 339 games at first base in the course of six seasons, made only his second career start at third base. When the left-handed swinging Joc Pederson led off the game, San Diego employed a shift on the right side of the infield and had Alonso stationed on the grass in short right. Alonso's brother-in-law is Baltimore's smooth-fielding third baseman Manny Machado.	BRING ON THE DODGERS	Saturday night's attendance of 43,525 was the Padres' eighth sellout of the season at Petco Park, and the fourth with the Dodgers in town.  In Los Angeles' only other appearance here this season, the teams drew a total attendance of 127, 987, the third-highest total for a three-game series at Petco.	RARE GREINKE LOSS VS. NL WEST	Since joining the Dodgers in 2013, it was a rarity for Greinke to lose to an NL West team. He is 22-3 with a 2.07 ERA against division opponents.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: LHP Paco Rodriguez (left elbow strain) will begin a rehab assignment on Monday with Single-A Rancho Cucamonga. .. RHP Brandon League (right shoulder impingement) will make his third rehab appearance on Monday or Tuesday. .. INF/OF Scott Van Slyke (back inflammation) is scheduled to play the next three straight days for Rancho Cucamonga.	Padres: In his first start in more than three years, LHP Corey Luebke threw 14 pitches in one scoreless inning Saturday night for Single-A Lake Elsinore.  Luebke, who has undergone two Tommy John operations, pitched for the first time since April 2012. ... RHP Josh Johnson (Tommy John surgery) will throw a simulated game in San Diego on Monday.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: RHP Mike Bolsinger (4-1, 2.08 ERA) has been tough on all opponents this season, including San Diego. In his only start against the Padres, the righty limited them to one hit with eight strikeouts in eight scoreless innings of a 2-0 win on May 23.	Padres: RHP James Shields (7-0, 3.79) remains the only pitcher in the majors who has at least five wins and 10 or more starts with a loss. The 7-0 start is a personal best for Shields.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

DETROIT --  Miguel Cabrera doesn't care if he starts the All-Star Game but he sure ended his weekend with a powerful audition.	Cabrera once again tagged Corey Kluber and the Cleveland Indians, hitting a booming home run and leading the Detroit Tigers to an 8-1 victory Sunday.	Cabrera hit his 14th homer, a solo drive in the fourth inning that went an estimated 450 feet into the left edge of the batter's eye. It landed close to the 452-footer he hit Friday night.	Some fans and critics have complained about the All-Star voting, which currently has seven Kansas City Royals players in starting spots for the American League.	It doesn't bother Cabrera.	"If they ask me, I'll go play," he said. "Whether they vote for me or don't vote for me, I don't care. Whichever is good.	"If I'm on the All-Star team, that's good. We play for something, we play to be the home team in the World Series. That's very important."	He's also not concerned with how far his homers travel -- just as long as they clear the wall.	"We won," he said. "That's more important. ... It doesn't matter if it's far or short."	Depends on whom you ask.	"There's not many no-doubters that go to that part of the park," manager Brad Ausmus said. "That's two in a series and if you didn't have Miguel Cabrera here you'd be lucky to see two in a season."	The two-time AL MVP is 20 for 35 with five homers in his career against Kluber (3-8). The reigning Cy Young Award winner lost his third straight decision and remained winless against AL Central opponents.	"You're asking the wrong guy," Kluber deadpanned when asked how he approaches the slugger. "He's doing a really good job of hitting mistakes when we throw them."	Cabrera had three hits and scored three times. He went 7 for 11 in the series with two homers and six RBI.	J.D. Martinez added a three-run homer for the Tigers on a soggy afternoon.	Alfredo Simon (7-3) allowed three hits and struck out five in the first five innings.	Heavy, persistent rain delayed the game for nearly two hours after the fifth and ended both starters' afternoons. Kluber gave up two runs and four hits in five innings.	Martinez sent his 12th home run into the right-field stands to chase Scott Atchison, who relieved Kluber after the rain delay.	Bryan Holaday hit a two-run double during the Tigers' three-run eighth.	Brandon Moss hit his 11th home run in the ninth off Joakim Soria.	LINDOR ARRIVES	Indians INF Francisco Lindor has drawn raves for his defense, but made his major league debut as a DH. He got his first hit in the ninth when he singled off Soria and certainly will remember it -- he tripped after touching first and had to go back after falling down.	"I didn't feel my legs," he said with a broad smile. "As soon as it hit the ground, I was thinking two. I didn't make it."	The 21-year-old's contract was purchased from Triple-A Columbus, where he hit .281 with 22 RBI in 58 games. Lindor was the eighth overall pick in the 2011 first-year draft.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: DH Nick Swisher was put on the 15-day disabled list with left knee inflammation. He underwent procedures on both knees last season that delayed his 2015 debut until May 3. Swisher is hitting .198 with two homers and eight RBI in 30 games.	Tigers: DH Victor Martinez was 1 for 4 with an RBI on Sunday in the first of a four-game rehab assignment with Triple-A Toledo. Manager Brad Ausmus said the team will evaluate Martinez, who finished second in last season's AL MVP voting, after Toledo finishes a series later this week at Syracuse. Martinez has been on the 15-day disabled list since May 19 with a nagging left knee injury. ... Reliever Bruce Rondon (biceps tendinitis) pitched the eighth inning of the game for Toledo and allowed a hit with a strikeout and walk in a scoreless frame. The team could make a decision on his future as early as Monday.	UP NEXT	Indians: Trevor Bauer (5-3, 3.53) starts for Cleveland in the series opener against the Cubs' Jake Arrieta (6-4, 3.16).	Tigers: Anibal Sanchez (4-7, 5.16) faces visiting Cincinnati to begin a two-game series.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

NEW YORK --  Dilson Herrera put paper cups on his ears. Rally cups.	Juan Lagares wore orange wristbands that feature a funny-looking drawing of himself.	Whatever the New York Mets did Sunday to inspire some positive mojo, it certainly worked.	Lagares hit a go-ahead homer and the Mets used a surprising power surge to erase a five-run deficit, beating the Atlanta Braves 10-8 for their biggest comeback victory since 2011.	"That's an amazing win right there," said Lagares, given a replica championship belt as the star of the game. "The whole team battled the whole game."	Darrell Ceciliani launched his first major league home run, and Herrera also had a solo shot in the fourth inning. Travis d'Arnaud's two-run drive off reliever Brandon Cunniff trimmed the deficit to 8-7 in the fifth.	Pinch-hitter Michael Cuddyer and Curtis Granderson singled in the sixth before Lagares pulled a 1-2 breaking ball from Luis Avilan (2-2) into the left-field stands. Lagares held his bat aloft for a moment as he began his trot around the bases, then celebrated in the dugout with excited teammates who pointed at his wristbands.	"I don't think anybody ever felt like we were out of it," d'Arnaud said. "Shows the fight and resiliency this team has."	Wilmer Flores had an early two-run single for the Mets, who took two of three in the series. The hitters bailed out Dillon Gee, knocked around in a spot start five days after his first relief appearance in more than four years.	Lagares and Granderson both finished with three hits on Banner Day at Citi Field. None of the four Mets who went deep have more than three homers this season.	The previous time New York won after trailing by at least five runs was Sept. 22, 2011, at St. Louis.	New father Jeurys Familia got four outs for his 19th save in 20 tries, aided by Herrera's sensational play at second base to end the eighth.	Sean Gilmartin (1-0) worked two hitless innings for his first career win, striking out three.	"He did a great job. Right when we needed those innings, he gave them to us," manager Terry Collins said.	Jace Peterson hit his second major league homer for the Braves, a three-run shot. He tied a career high with three hits and scored three times from the leadoff spot.	Kelly Johnson had three hits and two RBI, and Juan Uribe also got three hits. But rookie starter Mike Foltynewicz failed to make it through five innings after he was handed leads of 5-1 and 8-3.	"I just didn't have it today," Foltynewicz said. "It's not a question of confidence. I know how good I am and what I'm capable of. I just have to keep attacking, and work my way through it."	After he was pulled, the latest meltdown by a struggling bullpen left the Braves with their 10th loss in 14 games at Citi Field.	Atlanta lost for the fourth time this year when scoring at least eight runs. New York had not won when allowing eight or more since beating San Diego 9-8 on Aug. 8, 2011. That was the longest current drought in the majors.	"Couldn't stop them from scoring," Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez said.	PROUD PAPAS	Familia rejoined the team after missing Saturday's game to spend time with his new son. Jeurys Familia Jr. was born while the reliever was finishing off Friday night's win. He rushed to the hospital immediately afterward, getting a ride from a Mets employee. "Can't drive. I was a little nervous," said Familia, who received congratulations from teammates when he arrived in the clubhouse Sunday morning. "Oh, man. I don't have words to describe it," he said. "It feels awesome." Mets infielder Ruben Tejada also is a new father. He was activated from the paternity leave list and played third base.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: Tejada will be the regular third baseman until Daniel Murphy (strained left quadriceps) returns from the disabled list, Collins said.	BIG JUMP	Right-handed reliever Akeel Morris, a top prospect at Class A St. Lucie, was on his way to New York and is expected to be available out of the Mets' bullpen Monday, the team said. The 22-year-old Morris has 13 saves and a 1.69 ERA with 46 strikeouts in 32 innings in the Florida State League.	UP NEXT	Braves: Rookie right-hander Williams Perez remains scheduled to start Monday night in Boston after throwing nine pitches in the 11th inning Saturday to earn his first career save.	Mets: SS Jose Reyes returns to Citi Field with the surging Blue Jays in an interleague matchup with familiar faces on both sides. Rookie RHP Noah Syndergaard (2-4), drafted 38th overall by Toronto in 2010, was traded to New York along with d'Arnaud in a December 2012 deal that sent knuckleballer R.A. Dickey to the Blue Jays. Syndergaard pitches Monday night against Mark Buehrle (7-4). "I'm just going into it like it's another game," Syndergaard said. "I don't really hold any grudges against them for that."	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

MIAMI --  Jorge De La Rosa snapped a losing streak and set a franchise record for wins.	The 34-year-old left-hander became the Colorado Rockies' career leader in victories Sunday, pitching seven innings to prevent a four-game sweep and beat the Miami Marlins 4-1.	De La Rosa improved to 73-47 with the Rockies, surpassing Aaron Cook, who went 72-68.	"I'm excited to win all those games for this team," De La Rosa said. "I hope I can do more."	Charlie Blackmon and Nolan Arenado homered to give the Rockies a 3-0 lead in the first inning. That was one more run than they totaled while losing first three games of the series.	De La Rosa (4-2) pitched around four walks and two errors, allowing one run to lower his ERA to 4.91. The Rockies, who broke a four-game losing streak, have won De La Rosa's past five starts after he was slowed by injuries early in the season.	Three relievers combined to complete a five-hitter, and John Axford struck out the side in the ninth for his 12th save in as many chances. After throwing the final pitch, Axford fetched the ball and gave it to De La Rosa as a souvenir.	De La Rosa's career victory total doesn't exactly rival Walter Johnson's 417 wins with the Washington Senators, but the Rockies ace has endured a lot in his career, pitching for 16 minor league teams and returning from Tommy John surgery in 2011.	"When he's right and gets on a roll, this is how he throws," manager Walt Weiss said. "He looked like vintage Jorge."	Dan Haren (6-3) bounced back after the rough first inning, but by then the damage was done. He allowed three runs in six innings.	"As it turned out, Haren settled in pretty well, and those runs really made the difference in the game," Blackmon said. "We got him early before he got a good feel."	Blackmon homered to start a game for the fourth time in his career, giving the Rockies their first lead since Tuesday. Four batters later, Arenado hit his 16th homer following a walk.	It was the first time since Aug. 15 that the Marlins gave up more than one homer in a game at spacious Marlins Park.	"I know the Rockies have been struggling to score runs," Haren said, "but their lineup is very good, and it has hit me well in the past."	The Marlins scored in the seventh on pinch-hitter Ichiro Suzuki's two-out RBI single, but they went 1 for 10 with runners in scoring position. Giancarlo Stanton, who leads the majors in home runs and RBI, went 1 for 3 with a broken-bat single and a walk.	Colorado's Troy Tulowitzki went 0 for 2 with two walks, snapping his 12-game hitting streak, which was the longest active streak in the majors.	RELIVER'S COMEBACK	Deposed Marlins closer Steve Cishek made his first appearance since a brief demotion to the minors, coming in with the bases loaded in the seventh inning. One run scored on a forceout, but Cishek retired Carlos Gonzalez with the bases loaded to end the inning.	DEFENSIVE SLUMP	Rockies 3B Arenado, who has won a Gold Glove in each of his first two big league seasons, committed two errors to increase his season total to seven. He had 15 last year.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins ace Jose Fernandez (elbow) is scheduled to make his next rehab start Wednesday for Triple-A New Orleans at Round Rock. Fernandez has made two rehab starts for Class-A Jupiter. RHP Jarred Cosart will also make a rehab start Tuesday for New Orleans before rejoining the Marlins.	Marlins: 3B Martin Prado left the game in the first inning with a sprained right shoulder after taking a tumble past first base trying to beat out a grounder.	Rockies: OF Corey Dickerson wasn't in the lineup after aggravating his sore left foot Saturday. He went on the disabled list in May with plantar fasciitis.	"You never know how bad it can get or when it's going to act up," Dickerson said. He was available off the bench but did not play.	UP NEXT	Yankees: Slugger Alex Rodriguez, who grew up in Miami, pays a visit to Marlins Park beginning Monday to start a four-game, home-and-home series.	Rockies: RHP Chad Bettis (2-1, 3.05) is scheduled to start Monday when they begin a four-game, home-and-home series at Houston.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Asdrubal Cabrera ruined a milestone day for Chris Sale with one late-game swing.	Cabrera hit a two-run homer off the Chicago ace in the seventh inning, lifting the Tampa Bay Rays to a 2-1 victory over the White Sox on Sunday for a three-game sweep.	"Nothing's better than when you do something to help the team win," Cabrera said. "As soon as I hit it, I knew it was out. It was awesome."	Sale (6-3) struck out 12, walked three and hit a batter over 6 2/3 innings. He became the first pitcher since Boston's Pedro Martinez in 2001 to strikeout 12 or more in four straight starts. The left-hander allowed two runs and three hits during a 125-pitch outing.	"It was phenomenal watching him pitch today," said Chicago bench coach Mark Parent, filling in this weekend while manager Robin Ventura attended his daughter's college graduation. "It was awesome. The loss is a letdown, but the letdown is really not getting him some runs."	After Steven Souza Jr. opened the seventh with a walk, Cabrera hit a high fly into the left-field seats off Sale to make it 2-1.	"It was a stupid mistake walking the guy," Sale said. "Then a fastball right down the middle and you lose the game. Guys are going to hit home runs; you can't control that. What I can control is giving guys free passes."	It was Cabrera's third homer this season and first since May 19. He has just two extra-base hits over his last 19 games.	"I know he hasn't performed offensively the way he wants or is capable of," Rays manager Kevin Cash said of Cabrera, who is hitting .206. "You get big knocks like that, it erases some of those tough games."	C.J. Riefenhauser (1-0) threw a scoreless seventh to get his first major league win. After Steve Geltz pitched the eighth, Kevin Jepsen got the final three outs for his fifth save.	Tampa Bay (35-29) has won 11 of 15 to move a season-high six games over. 500.	Gordon Beckham, mired in an 0-for-21 slide, doubled off Nathan Karns and scored on Carlos Sanchez's single to put the White Sox up 1-0 in the second.	Karns gave up one run, seven hits and one walk and struck out eight in six innings. Chicago had a runner in scoring position in each of the right-hander's six innings but failed to score in five of them.	Sale worked out of two-on jams in the first and third, striking out Rays slugger Evan Longoria in both innings. He has struck out 10 or more in a franchise-best five consecutive starts.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: RHP Jake Odorizzi (left oblique) played catch for the first time in a week. ... LHP Drew Smyly (left labrum tear) will play catch for the second time Monday. ... LHP Matt Moore (elbow surgery) will make his third rehab start Monday for Class A Charlotte.	SPECIAL SALE	Sale is just the third pitcher since records were first available in 1914 to have four straight 12 or more strikeout starts. Martinez did it three times and Randy Johnson once. The duo will enter the Hall of Fame together this summer. ... Sale has a franchise-best 24 double-digit strikeout games in his career. ... It was the first time that a White Sox pitcher had 12 or more strikeouts, allowed three hits or fewer and lost. ... Sale was two short of his career-high pitch total of 127.	UP NEXT	White Sox: Rookie LHP Carlos Rodon (2-0) will face LHP Francisco Liriano (3-5) in Monday night's game at Pittsburgh. Chicago is 17-9 all-time against the Pirates, winning eight of the last nine meetings.	Rays: RHP Erasmo Ramirez (5-2), who has won five of his last six starts, and Washington LHP Gio Gonzalez (4-3) are Monday night's starters.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

BALTIMORE --  The New York Yankees might have a busy weekend before getting a one-day break ahead of the playoffs.	After clinching an AL wild-card berth on Thursday night with a 4-1 win over Boston, the Yankees had their game Friday against the Orioles postponed by rain.	The makeup will be made up as part of a split doubleheader Saturday. The starting times at 12:05 p.m. and 7:05 p.m.	The teams then conclude the regular season with a matchup on Sunday afternoon.	Ivan Nova (6-10, 4.89 ERA) is scheduled to start the first game Saturday, followed by Luis Severino (5-3, 2.77). But that could change if Houston loses on Friday night, assuring New York home-field advantage in Tuesday's winner-take-all, wild-card matchup.	"Nova would still be the first, but Sevi, we might do something different," manager Joe Girardi said.	If New York clinches that home game, then Girardi will likely rest his regulars.	"The most important thing going through this weekend is to clinch the home field for us," he said. "And in saying that, I don't really have plans of playing any one person two games tomorrow. To me, that doesn't make a lot of sense, that you would do that physically to the guys and risk injury (or) fatigue."	Baltimore was eliminated from contention earlier this week. The Orioles need a three-game sweep to avoid a losing season.	Wei-Yin Chen (10-8, 3.35 ERA) will pitch the opener, followed by Ubaldo Jimenez (12-10, 4.10 ERA).	Chen is a pending free agent, meaning this could be the left-hander's final appearance with Baltimore. In four years with the Orioles, Chen is 45-32 with a 3.73 ERA.	Manager Buck Showalter believes it should be more of the same on Saturday.	"I expect him to pitch the way he has most of his time here," he said. "He's been very solid all year. Very proud of his health and the things he's been able to maintain. Every time he's take the mound for us, I like our chances.	"Very good evaluation, very good signing. Hopefully it will continue."	Earlier Friday, Chris Davis was named Most Valuable Oriole in balloting by members of the media who cover the team. Davis leads the majors with 45 home runs and has 112 RBI.	He also was named Most Valuable Oriole in 2013. Davis slipped dramatically last year, batting only .197, but has come up with a season that should make him a hot commodity during the offseason, when he too becomes a free agent.	"We couldn't have been as competitive as we've been this year without him," Showalter said. "I think he was very disappointed at the right things that happened last year. He wanted to be there for the club all year and be somebody we could count on, and he was."	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

BOSTON -- The way the Toronto Blue Jays are playing these days, even the last hitter in their lineup is plenty dangerous.	The Blue Jays won their 11th straight game to tie the team record, routing the Boston Red Sox 13-5 Sunday as ninth-place batter Ryan Goins homered, doubled and drove in five runs.	"Honestly, I think everybody's coming here every day knowing we're going to win," Goins. "You put that with probably having the best one-through-six in the whole league and it makes it easier for seven, eight, nine."	Danny Valencia, batting seventh, also homered as the highest-scoring club in the majors completed a sweep at Fenway Park and sent Boston to its season-worst sixth straight loss.	This is the fourth time Toronto has won 11 in a row, most recently in 2013. The Blue Jays can set the team mark Monday night when star shortstop Jose Reyes returns to Citi Field to play the New York Mets.	"The one word that describes it is 'fun,' " Goins said.	The Blue Jays have scored 88 runs in their streak, including 31 this weekend in Boston.	Goins' three-run homer capped a six-run fourth inning as the Blue Jays roughed up rookie Eduardo Rodriguez (2-1).	According to research provided by the Red Sox, Rodriguez was the first pitcher in major league history to go six or more innings and not allow more than one run or three hits in each of his first three starts.	"He's been great and you can tell why and he's going to be great, but we're some kind of hot right now," manager John Gibbons said.	Marco Estrada (4-3) gave up five runs in five innings.	David Ortiz hit a three-run homer for Boston, which fell 10 games under .500.	"We're not in a good place right now as a team, but it's not because we're not giving effort," Boston manager John Farrell said. "We're not executing completely."	Toronto opened a 10-0 lead in the fifth. Chris Colabello had a RBI single and Russell Martin chased Rodriguez with a run-scoring double, with Red Sox fans booing when left fielder Hanley Ramirez misplayed a carom in the corner.	Valencia then hit reliever Steven Wright's first pitch completely over the Green Monster seats.	Rodriguez gave up nine runs on eight hits and three walks in 4 2/3 innings.	Asked what he learned from the outing, he said: "Throw better pitches."	"Throw the pitch exactly where I want," he said.	The Red Sox answered with five in the bottom of the inning. Dustin Pedroia and Ramirez had RBI singles before Ortiz homered.	Goins' two-run double came in a three-run seventh.	NICE GRAB	Blue Jays CF Kevin Pillar came charging in and made a diving grab on Alejandro De Aza's liner in right center.	SUN TROUBLES	The Red Sox lost two balls in the sun -- one by 2B Pedroia -- and another dropped between four players in short center. Blue Jays RF Jose Bautista also lost one.	"Obviously (it was) pretty bad anytime you see Pedroia fighting the sun," Gibbons said.	HOOPS GUY	Celtics forward Kelly Olynyk watched the game from the right-field roof deck.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: After the game, Gibbons said RHP Aaron Sanchez will be placed on the 15-day DL with a strained muscle in the back of his shoulder.	Red Sox: 3B Pablo Sandoval was back in the starting lineup after leaving Saturday's loss with tightness in his right quadriceps. ... RHP Justin Masterson, on the 15-day DL with right shoulder tendinitis, will make another rehab start for Triple-A Pawtucket on Tuesday. ... Farrell said he'd know if CF Mookie Betts would be back in the lineup Monday after taking BP Sunday. He ran into the wall near Boston's bullpen on Friday. ... Slumping Mike Napoli was rested for the second straight day, but is expected back in the lineup Monday.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays: LHP Mark Buehrle (7-4, 4.25 ERA) is slated to face the Mets' RHP Noah Syndergaard (2-4, 4.15) when the clubs open a two-game series. Buehrle has won his last three starts, twice throwing complete games.	Red Sox: RHP Rick Porcello (4-6, 5.26 ERA) looks to halt his four-game losing streak when the Red Sox open a two-game series against Atlanta and RHP Williams Perez (2-0, 2.78) on Monday at Fenway.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PITTSBURGH --  The roar began the moment Sean Rodriguez recorded the last out of the ninth inning and only grew louder as A.J. Burnett slowed walked toward the Pittsburgh Pirates dugout.	This is why the 38-year-old pitcher left money on the table in Philadelphia last winter to return to the Pirates. This is why he wanted his to end his career in a place where he helped spark a turnaround after two decades of misery.	And this -- two-plus hours of spectacular work against the reeling Phillies -- is why the Pirates happily welcomed him back. While Josh Harrison owned the moment when he drove in Neil Walker with two outs in the bottom of the 11th to lift Pittsburgh to a 1-0 win, the afternoon belonged to the wise old man on one of baseball's best pitching staffs.	"Words can't really describe what (Burnett) has done," Harrison said. "It's something you've got to take notice of every time he starts. I'm just glad to be a part of it, to be able to enjoy it."	Burnett scattered five hits in nine innings, walking one and striking out four to lower his ERA to 1.89. He needed to be brilliant to match former teammate Cole Hamels, who overwhelmed Pittsburgh in seven scoreless innings, striking out 12 before giving way to a bullpen that couldn't stop the Phillies from dropping their sixth straight.	"I just tried to stay up with him," Burnett said.	Something the Pirates are doing with regularity. Pittsburgh has won four straight, three of them by shutout to drop its team ERA to 2.83, tops in the majors. Burnett's 1.89 ERA trails only 24-year-old teammate Gerrit Cole's 1.71.	"I tell (Cole), I don't know if he believes me yet or not but when you watch him do what he does and I get to come out behind him and throw it, it's motivation," Burnett said. "It makes me want to go a little more."	Still, Pittsburgh needed a little help from Philadelphia to escape. Neil Walker singled off Jonathan Papelbon (1-1) with two outs in the ninth. Jose Tabata reached when Philadelphia shortstop Freddy Galvis threw a routine grounder into the stands. Harrison followed with a crisp shot up the middle.	"I just made a bad throw," Galvis said. "I just threw the ball and it went up there."	Antonio Bastardo (2-1) picked up the win after working the top of the 11th. The Pirates have swept six series this season, the most of any team in the majors and are 22-11 since May 9.	Burnett spent a forgettable season with Philadelphia in 2014, losing 18 games and leading the majors in walks before returning to Pittsburgh in the offseason for what he promises will be his final go-round. He is pitching like someone a decade younger, helped on Sunday by more than a little help behind him.	Andrew McCutchen made a leaping grab at the center field wall in the first to take extra bases away from Ryan Howard, and Sean Rodriguez went all out to haul in a sinking liner to right Galvis in the fifth.	"We had guys diving out in right, diving out in center, third base, first base," Burnett said. "Just a fun defensive game to pitch."	Hamels didn't need much assistance, mostly because the Pirates had problems putting the ball in play. His only trouble spot came in the fourth when two singles and a hit by pitch loaded the bases. Jordy Mercer grounded out to third to end the threat and Hamels went back to keeping Pittsburgh's right-hand heavy lineup in knots.	He retired 11 of the last 12 batters he faced, the final one a meek grounder by Burnett that went right back to Hamels. Rather than run to first, Burnett held up his hands as if to say "I'm good" while Hamels jogged to the bag to record the out.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: Former first-round draft pick RHP Jameson Taillon threw four innings in extended spring training on Saturday without incident as he continues his comeback from reconstructive elbow surgery. General manager Neal Huntington said Taillon came out feeling just fine after a 61-pitch effort. Taillon, now months removed from surgery, is nearing a return to game action but Huntington said there is no timetable.	UP NEXT	Phillies: Philadelphia begins a four-game home-and-home interleague set with Baltimore on Monday when Aaron Harang (4-7, 3.04) faces Wei-Yin Chen (6-2, 2.11) at Camden Yards. Harang is 1-2 with a 6.00 ERA in three career starts against Baltimore.	Pirates: Pittsburgh meets the Chicago White Sox for the first time since 2010 when the White Sox visit PNC Park on Monday. Francisco Liriano (3-5, 3.25 ERA) starts for Pittsburgh against LHP Carlos Rodon (2-0, 2.66 ERA). The Pirates are 9-17 against the White Sox in interleague play.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

MILWAUKEE -- The way Max Scherzer was pitching, the Milwaukee Brewers were going to need a bit of luck to get anyone on base.	They got it -- barely.	Scherzer struck out a Nationals-record 16 and threw a one-hitter, losing his perfect-game bid on Carlos Gomez's broken-bat, bloop single in the seventh inning as Washington beat the Brewers 4-0 Sunday.	"I was able to execute every pitch for the most part where I wanted to," Scherzer said.	Gomez opened the seventh with a looper to shallow right field that just fell inches beyond the outstretched glove of second baseman Anthony Rendon. Gomez said he "got lucky" to get that hit off Scherzer.	"I wouldn't imagine that that's going to be the last opportunity that he's going to have to do something special," Nationals manager Matt Williams said.	Scherzer watched the ball drop then turned away.	"Why would I be disappointed on a broken-bat base hit? It takes luck to do that," Scherzer said.	Scherzer set a career high for strikeouts and broke the Nationals mark of 14 set by Stephen Strasburg in his big league debut in 2010. The franchise record of 18 was set by Bill Gullickson in 1980 with Montreal; the Expos moved to Washington for the 2005 season.	Scherzer (7-5) walked one and finished the day with a 1.93 ERA.	He was still throwing fastballs in the mid-90s in the eighth inning. Scherzer's off-speed stuff kept hitters off-balance.	"Every at-bat you stand at the plate, you see him ... throwing a pitch consistently, throwing the ball where the catcher wanted the ball, pounding the strike zone down," Gomez said. "And he got that change and the slider all day long."	Scherzer, in the first season of a seven-year, $210 million contract, threw his second complete game in his 211th start of his career, which includes a Cy Young Award, two All-Star selections and a lot of strikeouts.	His other complete game was a three-hit shutout on June 12, 2014, for the Detroit Tigers against the Chicago White Sox.	The Brewers rarely hit the ball out of the infield. When they did, the 30-year-old righty mainly held hitters to harmless popouts.	Scherzer also hit a single in the fourth. Going into the seventh, he had reached base more than the Brewers.	Scooter Gennett worked a full-count walk with one out in the eighth, about the closest that Scherzer came to showing any semblance of struggling.	Scherzer came back to strike out Hector Gomez and Martin Maldonado swinging, the second whiff coming on a 96 mph fastball.	The Nationals scored two runs off rookie Taylor Jungmann (1-1), who labored through five innings in his second career start. Clint Robinson added a two-run double with two outs in the seventh off Jeremy Jeffress.	Jungmann allowed seven hits, walked two and struck out five. He liked his breaking ball but felt he didn't have command of his fastball.	Manager Craig Counsell said Jungmann has earned another turn in place of injured starter Wily Peralta.	"Hopefully, the next outing, I can put together the fastball and the breaking ball and go from there. We'll see what happens," Jungmann said.	Washington salvaged a split of a four-game series with last-place Milwaukee even with slugger Bryce Harper watching from the dugout. He got the day off after being hit by a fastball on his left leg in Saturday's 7-2 win over the Brewers.	"He's still sore. Good that we were able to get him a day off today and get some treatment on it. We'll see how he is tomorrow," Williams said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: 2B Danny Espinosa stayed in the game after appearing to hurt his right foot on a slide while being thrown out by catcher Maldonado trying to steal second to end the top of the third.	Brewers: Veterans 3B Aramis Ramirez and C Jonathan Lucroy got regular days off from the starting lineup.	UP NEXT	Nationals: Washington opens a home-and-home series against the Rays with two games at Tampa Bay. LHP Gio Gonzalez (4-3) won his only career start against the Rays while with Washington, a 5-2 win at Nationals Park on June 21, 2012.	Brewers: Kyle Lohse (3-7) takes the mound for the start of a home-and-home, four-game series against Kansas City. The right-hander last won when the Brewers beat the Mets 7-0 on May 15, going winless in his next five starts.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

HOUSTON --  Lance McCullers wasn't upset that he didn't get a chance to return for the sixth after throwing five hitless innings Sunday.	The rookie was just glad he did enough to help Houston get a win.	McCullers and four relievers combined for a two-hitter, Evan Gattis tied a career high with four hits and the Astros cruised to a 13-0 victory over the Seattle Mariners.	"We pitch to win ball games and to get this team down the road into the playoffs and to pitch in the playoffs," McCullers said. "Not going back out there was not a big deal."	The win gives Houston five straight series wins against Seattle, which marks the first time they've won five in a row over one opponent since 2010 when they did it against the Cubs.	McCullers (3-1) struck out four through five, but he needed 90 pitches to get through those innings because of four walks.	Manager A.J. Hinch said McCullers couldn't have talked him into staying in the game.	"It's not really a negotiation so I told Lance, `You're done,' and he said, `OK," Hinch said. "These guys all want to pitch as long as they can. It's always one extra inning or one extra out or one extra batter and that's what you want from your guys, but he was done when he was done."	He was replaced by Tony Sipp for the sixth inning and Austin Jackson doubled with one out in the inning.	Joe Thatcher allowed one hit in the seventh, Will Harris threw a perfect eighth and Josh Fields completed the shutout.	Colby Rasmus had three RBI as the Astros built a 10-0 lead by the fourth inning on a day where all but one player in the starting lineup had a hit.	Seattle starter Roenis Elias (3-4) was roughed up for seven hits and a career-high eight runs in 3 1/3 innings in his shortest start of the season.	"He just didn't have much command today, and it was a tough day for him in a lot of different ways," manager Lloyd McClendon said.	The 21-year-old McCullers has been great for Houston since making the jump from Double-A. He has a 2.00 ERA in six starts.	"All these are growing experiences for Lance," Hinch said. "He's learning that he's going to have to win in different ways. He doesn't have to be dominant every time, he doesn't have to do it all himself."	The Astros were playing without All-Star second baseman Jose Altuve, who missed his second straight game with a strained right hamstring. Marwin Gonzalez filled in and had a homer and two RBI.	The Mariners won 8-1 on Saturday, but their offensive woes returned on Sunday as they struck out 10 times and were shut out for the second time in this series and third time in four games.	Rasmus drove in two runs with a single in the first inning and the Astros made it 3-0 when Jake Marisnick reached and Chris Carter scored on an error by Kyle Seager.	A ground-rule RBI double by Marisnick and a bases-loaded walk in the third pushed it to 5-0. A run-scoring single by Rasmus made it 6-0 with one out in the fourth and chased Elias.	He was replaced by Danny Farquhar, but it didn't do anything to slow Houston down. He was greeted with a double by Hank Conger that sent two more home before a two-run homer by Luis Valbuena extended the lead to double digits with two outs in the inning.	He finally escaped the inning when Gonzalez grounded out.	Mark Lowe walked Conger with the bases loaded in the fifth inning to extend the lead to 11-0 and end a streak of 15 1/3 scoreless innings for the reliever.	Gonzalez hit a solo homer off Charlie Furbush in the sixth and Preston Tucker added an RBI double in the eighth.	Seattle's Logan Morrison had hit in every game in his career at Minute Maid Park, but went 0 for 4 on Sunday to snap the 18-game streak in Houston.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: Left fielder Mark Trumbo was a late scratch with back spasms. He said he doesn't think it is serious but isn't sure if he'll play on Monday.	Astros: Hinch said that Altuve was feeling better on Sunday and that they don't think his injury is serious. He is day to day.	UP NEXT	Mariners: Right-hander Taijuan Walker opposes San Francisco's Tim Hudson when the Mariners begin a two-game interleague series against the Giants on Monday. Walker is 2-1 with a 1.64 ERA in his last three starts.	Astros: Left-hander Dallas Keuchel faces Colorado's Chad Bettis in the first game of a two-game series with the Rockies on Monday. Keuchel is second in the AL with a 1.90 ERA.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Byron Buxton sat in the dugout about an hour before making his major league debut and identified speed as his greatest baseball attribute.	He quickly got to show it off, too.	Despite going 0 for 4, Buxton streaked home with the go-ahead run in the ninth inning and the Minnesota Twins beat the Texas Rangers 4-3 Sunday and ended a five-game losing streak.	"It's a day I'll cherish forever," Buxton said, "especially making my debut and getting the winning run across."	Regarded by many as the top prospect in baseball, the 21-year-old Buxton joined the Twins from Double-A. He batted ninth and played center, filling out a depleted Minnesota outfield.	Eduardo Escobar opened the Twins ninth with a double. Buxton, picked No. 2 in the 2012 draft, tried to sacrifice but bunted back to Shawn Tolleson (1-1), who threw out Escobar at third base.	Buxton said he hadn't sacrificed in a while -- his last one came in 2013 in the Class A Midwest League.	With two outs, Eddie Rosario doubled to center and Buxton scored without a play.	Twins manager Paul Molitor said the threat of Buxton stealing second -- he had 20 in 59 games this season for Double-A Chattanooga -- could have contributed to Rosario's success against Tolleson.	"Sometimes, that can lead to a mistake," Molitor said.	Buxton had scored a Southern League-high 44 runs when he was called up this weekend.	"He's got a beautiful stride. He runs like not too many people we've seen in this game," Molitor said.	The Twins were missing outfielders Torii Hunter, who was serving his suspension for a uniform-tossing tirade, and injured Aaron Hicks.	Casey Fien (2-2) pitched two scoreless innings and Glen Perkins pitched a perfect ninth for his American League-leading 22nd save as the Twins snapped a five-game losing streak.	Tolleson had been 8 for 8 in save situations since becoming the Rangers' closer in mid-May.	"I wasn't really putting myself in a good position there," he said.	The Twins' Brian Dozier opened the game with a home run, his 10th career leadoff shot and third this season.	Dozier also doubled to increase his league-leading total of extra-base hits to 36. Nine of Minnesota's 11 hits were for extra bases.	Joey Gallo and Leonys Martin homered for Texas in the second inning off Phil Hughes.	THREE'S COMPANY	The Twins matched a club record by hitting four triples, previously done in 1964. Three of them came in the sixth inning, yet they scored only one run in the inning -- in part because Shane Robinson was picked off third base when Escobar missed a squeeze sign. According to information provided to the Rangers by the Elias Sports Bureau, that's the only time in the past 50 years that a team hit three triples in an inning and scored fewer than two runs.	BAD NEWS, GOOD NEWS	Hughes gave up three runs in six innings, allowing multiple home runs for the fifth time in 13 starts. But both were solo homers. "If you're going to give them up, at least have nobody on," Hughes said. "It comes down to the fact that I haven't my stuff all year."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Twins: Buxton was added to the roster after Hicks (right forearm strain) was put on the disabled list Sunday.	Rangers: 3B Adrian Beltre (left thumb sprain) is eligible to come off the disabled list Tuesday, but said he still can't grip a bat.	UP NEXT	Twins: RHP Trevor May (4-4) gave up only one run in six innings in his last outing, June 9 against Kansas City, but took the loss in a 2-0 defeat.	Rangers: RHP Yovani Gallardo (5-6), whose previous eight seasons were in the National League, has five consecutive quality starts against the Los Angeles Dodgers.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Only twice have the Oakland Athletics had a full-time starting pitcher lead the American League in earned run average at the end of a season. Their names were Catfish Hunter in 1974 and Vida Blue in 1971.	Sonny Gray is making a strong bid to join them on that exclusive list.	Gray lowered his ERA to a majors-best 1.60 on Sunday with 7 2/3 impressive innings in an 8-1 victory over the Los Angeles Angels.	"It's fun every time I go out there," Gray said. "It's still real early, but it's just nice to go out there and get some innings and put the team in a position to win. I'm just throwing the ball well and getting some good defense behind me."	Gray (8-3) yielded an unearned run and five hits, struck out nine and did not walk a batter. The right-hander has issued only nine walks in his last eight starts after giving up career-high seven on May 3 at Texas.	"My fastball location is better and I'm throwing a lot more strikes," Gray said. "Today I threw my fastball where I wanted to and I hit my spots pretty well with my heater. And when you do that, you're going to win more times than not."	"I also threw some good curveballs and sliders and tried to keep the ball off their barrel as much as possible with hard movement. It was effective, and that's all I really care about," he said.	Gray is 5-1 with a 2.22 ERA in eight career starts against the Angels, including back-to-back wins in April when he retired his final 14 batters in the first one and 18 of his last 19 in the second one.	"I'm under the impression that he's doing that to everybody," Angels catcher Chris Iannetta said. "He's one of the best in the game, and I don't think he gets enough notoriety for how good he really is."	Matt Shoemaker (4-5) was charged with four runs -- three earned -- and six hits in 5 2/3 innings. He is 0-4 with a 5.17 ERA in six home starts this season, including a 6-3 loss to the A's on April 20, when he worked three-plus innings.	"He battled with his fastball command," Iannetta said. "When he had it he was good, and when he didn't have it, he wasn't as dominate. It fluctuated back and forth."	Eric Sogard drove in three runs and the A's capitalized on three errors. They scored an unearned run in the second after errors by Iannetta and second baseman Johnny Giavotella. Iannetta fumbled a squeeze bunt up the third base line by Sogard, and Ben Zobrist skipped around the catcher's attempted tag after he finally got control of the ball.	"It was nice to catch a little break there early in the game and squeeze one it," Zobrist said. "I thought Shoemaker threw pretty well. He just didn't get the breaks, didn't get the defense he would have liked. Finally, we were able to take advantage of some of those. We're due a few of these."	Josh Reddick increased the Athletics' margin to 2-0 in the third with a bloop single, and they tacked on three runs in the sixth and seventh innings.	The Angels scored in the fourth after shortstop Marcus Semien made his major league-worst 21st error this season. A wild pitch by Gray and a passed ball by Stephen Vogt set up an RBI single by Albert Pujols, the Angels' first hit.	Pujols's RBI was the 1,637th of his 15-year career, surpassing Ernie Banks for sole possession of 29th place on the all-time list. The three-time NL MVP, who homered in a 1-0 win Saturday night, has 17 RBI in his last 16 games, along with 10 home runs.	UP NEXT	Athletics: RHP Jesse Hahn (3-5) opposes Tyson Ross on Monday night in the first of four consecutive games against the Padres, who will host the first two before the scene switches to Oakland. Hahn spent his rookie season with San Diego before coming to the Bay Area last December in a multiplayer trade that sent C Derek Norris to the Padres. The A's have committed 11 errors this season with Hahn on the mound, resulting in eight unearned runs.	Angels: RHP Jered Weaver (4-6) gets the assignment against Robbie Ray on Monday night in the first of four straight games against the Arizona Diamondbacks -- the first two being played in Anaheim. Weaver is 16-5 with a 2.68 ERA in 31 career interleague starts, including a 12-3 win against the D-backs at Chase Field on June 26, 2009 -- his only other outing against them.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Everybody in the Arizona dugout was rooting for Rubby De La Rosa to get his first complete game. They were no less disappointed when Daniel Hudson preserved the victory.	De La Rosa pitched an eight-hitter into the ninth inning Sunday, and the Arizona Diamondbacks chased Chris Heston after five innings in his first start coming off a no-hitter and beat the San Francisco Giants 4-0.	Heston pitched his gem against the New York Mets on Tuesday in his 13th major league start. His shot at matching Johnny Vander Meer's record of throwing consecutives no-hitters in 1938 ended with one out in the second when Jake Lamb doubled.	The rookie right-hander gave up three runs -- two earned -- on seven hits. He walked four and struck out two. Heston (6-5) had won four of his previous five decisions.	"Chris threw all right. He worked hard," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "He made more mistakes than normal but that was a good enough effort to keep us in the game."	Chris Owings drove in two runs for Arizona.	"A lot of guys had good at-bats," Owings said. "It was easy to go out there and compete with Rubby pitching his butt off."	De La Rosa (5-4) won for the first time since May 12, a span of six starts. He walked two and struck out six in eight-plus innings.	"I 100 percent wanted to get the last three outs," De La Rosa said. "I kept the ball low, the rhythm was good and the team helped me out a lot."	Hudson took over for De La Rosa following Joe Panik's double and Brandon Belt's single. He struck out Brandon Crawford and walked Casey McGehee to load the bases.	Buster Posey entered the game as a pinch hitter but Hudson got him to ground into a double play for his first career save.	"That was kind of a rush to be honest," Hudson said. "It's completely different from being a starter. I had to figure out how to control my emotions. My heart was pounding."	The Giants thrice hit into double plays with a runner on third, and hit into five overall. Crawford, in his first start as a cleanup hitter, had two hits for the Giants.	"This was one of our ugliest games," Bochy said. "The double plays, the errors; it was not pretty."	The Diamondbacks won six of their first seven games at AT&T Park and are not due to return until the middle of September. They own a 7-3 overall series lead.	The Giants lost their fourth straight overall and have lost eight in a row at home for the first time since 1993.	Lamb scored the game's first run on a two-error play by Crawford, who lost the handle on a grounder by Wellington Castillo and then overthrew first base to allow the run. Owings doubled home two runs in the fifth.	In the sixth, Ender Inciarte reached second on a fielding error by Jason Maxwell, who was in center field with Angel Pagan getting the day off and Gregor Blanco on the 7-day concussion list. After stealing third without a throw, Inciarte scored on A.J. Pollack's sacrifice fly.	Giants' Jarrett Parker singled in the fifth, his first major-league hit.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: Left-hander Patrick Corbin, recovering from Tommy John surgery last year, saw his first action Sunday with Double-A Mobile. He needed just six pitches to get through the first inning and threw 4 2/3 innings overall.	Giants: Blanco continues to feel the effects of a concussion and may not be ready to play when he is eligible on Tuesday.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: LHP Robbie Ray (1-1, 1.53) starts Monday night against the Los Angeles Angels in Anaheim. His last start was in Los Angeles against the Dodgers, a loss. The Angels hold a 12-9 edge in the series with Arizona.	Giants: RHP Tim Hudson (4-5, 4.60) makes the start when the Seattle Mariners come to town for a game Monday night. Hudson has a 13-6 record with a 3.17 ERA in 24 starts against the Mariners.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN DIEGO --  Adrian Gonzalez has hit well against his former team this season. However, he deflected the praise after leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to their latest win.	Gonzalez had a two-run single with two outs in the 12th inning Sunday, lifting the Dodgers to a 4-2 victory over the San Diego Padres.	In 12 games against the Padres this season, the San Diego native is 18 for 46 (.391), with six home runs and 13 RBI.	"This game is going to go to our bullpen," Gonzalez said.	It's tough arguing with Gonzalez's assessment.	The Dodgers' six relievers worked 7 1/3 shutout innings as the Padres lost their fourth series this season to Los Angeles.	Alberto Callaspo opened the 12th with a double off Dale Thayer, then Kike Hernandez and Joc Pederson walked. Gonzalez followed with his 12th and 13th RBI against the Padres this season.	"It was a fastball that was elevated a little," Gonzalez said. "I tried to stay on top of it because he is a fly ball pitcher. I didn't want to get under it and I tried to hit it on a line and it ended up in the right spot."	Gonzalez, who played five seasons with the Padres, had a two-out, RBI double off reliever Joaquin Benoit in the eighth to make it 2-all.	Josh Ravin (2-0) worked two innings for the win. Kenley Jansen pitched the 12th for his ninth save in 10 chances.	Thayer (2-2), the Padres' sixth pitcher, took the loss.	Pederson saved the game in the ninth with a running, over-the-shoulder catch while crashing into the wall on Justin Upton's two-out drive to center field with two on.	"I never thought it was going out, I thought it was going over his head," Upton said.	Padres manager Bud Black agreed.	"That was a remarkable catch," he said. "It was a great play by the kid."	James Shields, who came in 7-0, worked seven innings, allowing one run on five hits with three walks and six strikeouts and left with a 2-0 lead.	"We talked in the dugout and we felt it was time for him to come out," Black said.	Andre Either's homer in the seventh sliced the Dodgers' deficit to 2-1.	Upton's two-run, two-out single in the fifth gave the Padres a 2-0 lead.	Mike Bolsinger was charged with two runs, six hits and three walks in 4 2/3 innings. He struck out seven.	Bolsinger retired nine straight before Shields slapped a base hit past Gonzalez and took third on Will Venable's single. Venable stole second and Yangervis Solarte walked to load the bases. Upton followed with a solid hit to center field on an elevated off-speed pitch, scoring Shields and Venable and chasing Bolsinger.	In the third, Callaspo opened with a double but Bolsinger was unable to advance him, popping up to Shields on a bunt. Pederson followed with a single to right, but right fielder Matt Kemp threw out Callaspo at the plate with a nice sweep tag by Derek Norris.	"It was a game where we fought and scratched early and it didn't look good," Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said. "We kind of stole one.	"It was a sloppy series for us and it feels good to steal a couple of games when you do that."	THE SKINNY ON VINNY	Iconic Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully has added San Diego to his no-travel list this season. Scully, in his 66th season with the Dodgers, calls games in Los Angeles but only works away contests in San Francisco. The smooth-talking Scully turns 88 later this year.	BLACK AND BLUE LINE	Padres manager Bud Black is going with the Tampa Bay Lightning in its Stanley Cup series against the Chicago Blackhawks. What does Black know about hockey?

CHICAGO --  Starlin Castro has been deflecting criticism with game-winning hits.	Castro drove in the winning run for the second straight night with an RBI single in the 11th inning to lift the Chicago Cubs to a 2-1 victory over the Cincinnati Reds on Sunday night.	Chris Coghlan doubled just out of the reach of left fielder Kristopher Negron with one out in the 11th inning and scored the winning run on Castro's single to left-center off reliever Burke Badenhop (0-2).	Chicago took three of four in this series and is a season high seven games over .500.	Castro's RBI single in the ninth gave the Cubs the win Saturday night.	"He's starting to really get his mojo back, which is good for us," Cubs manager Joe Maddon said.	The 25 year-old shortstop, in his sixth season with the Cubs, has been criticized at times for his lack of development.	"Because he's been around for a while people may pick on him a little bit more because they kind of expect more out of him. He's still learning and he is listening," Maddon said.	The Cubs won for the eighth time with a game-ending hit.	Billy Hamilton had a career-high five stolen bases -- the most in a game since Jacoby Ellsbury stole five on May 30, 2013 -- and also tied a Reds record. Hamilton leads the majors with 31 steals.	"I finally got on base to even get a chance to steal a couple of bases. Lately I haven't been getting on base. I haven't been doing my job at the plate," said Hamilton, who came into the game with a .217 average. "If I get on base more, I'll have more opportunities to do this."	Brian Schlitter (1-2), called up from Triple-A Iowa before the game, got two outs in the 11th for the victory.	Cubs reliever Jason Motte pitched out of a no-out bases loaded jam in the ninth inning after a leadoff single by Joey Votto, a double by Todd Frazier, and an intentional walk. Motte got Brayan Pena to pop out, struck out Eugenio Suarez looking, then ended the inning when Negron flied out to center.	Reds starter Anthony DeSclafani pitched 6 2/3 innings, allowing one run and six hits. He struck out five and walked two.	Hamilton led off the sixth inning with a double to left. Then the speedster got a big lead off second on Jon Lester, who rarely makes a pickoff attempt, and stole third. Phillips followed with a run-scoring bloop single. The Reds had another chance at a run when Votto hit it into the gap in the left-center and, Phillips -- who has been hobbled with a groin injury -- was thrown out at the plate trying to score from first. Originally, home plate umpire Toby Basner called him safe, but it was reversed after a replay review.	David Ross led off the seventh inning with a double off DeSclafani and advanced to third on a sacrifice bunt by Jonathan Herrera. After a walk chased DeSclafani, Dexter Fowler hit a sacrifice fly off Reds reliever Ryan Mattheus to tie the score at 1-1.	After a rough start to June, Lester pitched seven innings, allowing one run and five hits. He came in winless over his previous four outings while pitching to a 10.61 ERA. In his previous start against the Tigers on Tuesday, Lester allowed five runs and nine hits in 4 1/3 innings.	Lester retired the first eight batters he faced in this one. Hamilton singled with two outs in the third and stole second and third, but Lester stranded him by getting Brandon Phillips to ground out.	With a runner on first and two outs in the fifth, Jay Bruce saved a potential run with a diving catch in deep right field, robbing Anthony Rizzo of extra bases.	UP NEXT	Reds: Jon Moscot (1-1) is scheduled to make his third career start against Detroit on Monday night. He picked up his first career win in his last start against Philadelphia on Wednesday, allowing two runs and six hits in six innings.	Cubs: Jake Arrieta (6-4) is the scheduled starter in the series opener against Cleveland. In three starts against Cleveland, Arrieta is 1-0 with a 9.20 ERA.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: Phillips, out with a left groin strain, was back in the lineup for the first time since Tuesday.	OUCH	First base umpire Ron Kulpa got hit on the shoulder from an errant warm-up pitch from Chapman while Chapman was warming up in the bullpen. Kulpa was apparently OK after a visit from a Cubs trainer.	CHALLENGES	Maddon was 2-0 on replay challenges. In addition to the successful challenge in the top of the fifth, Maddon also had Coghlan's foul ball overturned in the bottom of the inning. After the review indicated that ball dropped inside the line in right, Coghlan was rewarded with a double.  In the seventh, Reds manager Bryan Price had a hit by pitch on Rizzo overturned.	---	This story has been corrected to show Hamilton's first name is Billy instead of Joey.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

BOSTON --  Williams Perez prefers starting to relieving. In the last week, he's been pretty good at both.	Just two days after picking up his first career save in an extra-innings relief appearance, Perez pitched six shutout innings to lead the Atlanta Braves to a 4-2 victory over the Red Sox on Monday night. It was Boston's seventh straight loss.	"He's confident. He's locked in," Braves designated hitter Kelly Johnson said after the rookie right-hander won in his Fenway Park debut. "I don't think he (cares) where he is."	Perez (3-0) allowed five hits and two walks, striking out two. He has made six major league starts and allowed one run or none in five of them. He also pitched a scoreless 11th in Saturday's game against the New York Mets.	"He said he likes starting more than being a reliever or a closer," bullpen coach Eddie Perez said, acting as interpreter. "But he said he'd do anything to be in the big leagues."	Jason Grilli pitched the ninth for his 17th save, putting two on with one run in before getting pinch-hitter Alejandro De Aza on a weak grounder back to the mound. The Red Sox are in last place in the AL East, nine games behind Tampa Bay.	"We're fighting. We're not giving at-bats away," said Pablo Sandoval, who recorded his 200th career double and then added another for his 1,000th career hit. "We've got a good team. I've been in tough situations before. We need to stick together and play hard."	Nick Markakis, Juan Uribe and A.J. Pierzynski each had two of Atlanta's nine singles.	Williams Perez retired David Ortiz on a long flyball and Sandoval doubled with two outs. Mike Napoli reached on an error, and Mookie Betts singled in a run -- his third hit of the game -- to make it 4-2.	But Perez got De Aza, who is batting .208, to dribble the ball in front of the plate to end the game.	"You want him out there in different situations, and he always rises to the occasion," Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez. "I couldn't ask for anything more."	Rick Porcello (4-7) allowed four runs in 6 1/3 innings for Boston. Dustin Pedroia had two hits, and Xander Bogaerts hit a solo homer in the seventh.	Porcello walked one and struck out five but also hit a batter and threw two wild pitches. He gave up three straight singles in the fourth and the Braves scored three times.	Freddie Freeman singled with one out, stole second and scored on Markakis' single. Uribe singled, then one out later Markakis scored on a wild pitch. Pierzynski singled to make it 3-0.	Kelly Johnson singled and scored in the seventh to give Atlanta a 4-0 lead before Bogaerts hit his first homer since May 20.	WELCOME BACK	The Red Sox played a video for Jonny Gomes, who was the left fielder for their 2013 championship team. The highlights included the emotional moment in the victory parade when Gomes placed the World Series trophy at the Boston Marathon finish line, not far from the site of the bombing a few months earlier.	Gonzalez said he was glad to have someone on the roster familiar with Fenway's left field wall.	"He's talking about dead spots and all the stuff out there," Gonzalez said. "I don't think he's the Larry Bird of Fenway Park. I don't know if he's Larry Bird of the Green Monster."	OUCH	Andrelton Simmons was hit on the right hand when he tried to bunt in the seventh inning, but he stayed in the game. In the ninth, he had a throwing error, but Gonzalez said it was the wet conditions and not an injury.	Simmons was not scheduled for X-rays, Gonzalez said after the game.	LINEUP SHUFFLING	Braves: Atlanta promoted C Ryan Lavarnway from Triple-A and recalled RHP Sugar Ray Marimon. C Christian Bethancourt and OF Todd Cunningham were optioned to Gwinnett of the International League.	Red Sox: Napoli returned to the lineup after getting two days off to rest. He entered the game batting .200, and was moved to the No. 7 spot in the order. The Red Sox activated LHP Craig Breslow from the paternity list and recalled Robbie Ross Jr. from Triple-A. INF Travis Shaw was optioned to Pawtucket and INF Jeff Bianchi was designated for assignment.	UP NEXT	Braves: RHP Julio Teheran (4-2) will be facing the Red Sox for the first time.	Red Sox: LHP Miley (5-6) will make his first start since having a screaming match with manager John Farrell in the dugout during Thursday's game against Baltimore.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

BALTIMORE --  For Wei-Yin Chen, pitching against the offensively challenged Philadelphia Phillies made up for some of the misfortune he encountered earlier this season.	Chen pitched eight innings of four-hit ball, Matt Wieters hit a three-run homer and the Baltimore Orioles beat the skidding Phillies 4-0 Monday night.	Chen (3-4) struck out nine and walked one to help the Orioles win for the ninth time in 11 games. The eight innings tied his career high and was the longest stint by an Orioles starter this month.	Zach Britton got the final three outs to seal the last-place Phillies' seventh straight defeat. Philadelphia has been blanked in three of its last four games.	Although Chen came in with a 3.21 ERA over 12 starts, he often went weeks at a time without a win. Against the Phillies, however, the Taiwanese left-hander was in complete control.	"I felt great, and all my pitches were working today," Chen said through an interpreter.	It was one of those rare times this season when he got a win for his effort.	"If you're consistently pitching well, then those things work themselves out," manager Buck Showalter said. "Over the long haul, you'll get rewarded for it."	The Phillies have lost 11 in a row on the road and are a major league-worst 7-27 in away games. The loss -- their 17th in the last 20 games overall -dropped them a season-high 21 games under .500 (22-43).	"We need to swing the bats," manager Ryne Sandberg said. "I know the guys are playing hard, hustling and trying hard.  Players grinding it out, trying to turn the page."	Rookie Maikel Franco was ejected from the game in the seventh inning by home plate umpire Eric Cooper for arguing a third-strike call. Franco also showed his displeasure in the first inning after being called out on strikes.	"I just told him three times he called that pitch a ball," Franco said. "That is what happened. I wasn't happy with the first pitch he had called."	Aaron Harang (4-8) matched zeroes with Chen until the fifth inning, when Travis Snider hit a two-out double off the glove of left fielder Cody Asche and J.J. Hardy lined a single past the outstretched arm of shortstop Freddy Galvis.	Wieters connected in the sixth to make it 4-0. After missing the first two months of the season recovering from elbow surgery, Wieters is batting 333 with two homers and seven RBI in eight games.	"Right now, I'm just trying to see the ball well and trying to take that into the game," he said.	Harang gave up four runs and five hits in six innings. He's lost five straight starts for the first time since 2009.	"It was one pitch -- a flat, cement-mixer slider there to Wieters," the right-hander said. "I throw that ball down more, he's probably going to take that pitch for a ball."	After rain delayed the start for 27 minutes, both pitchers went to work. Chen allowed a walk over the first three innings and Harang yielded a bunt single by Chris Davis, who was wiped out in a double play.	Manny Machado drew a leadoff walk in the fourth and reached third base with one out before Harang retired Adam Jones and Davis.	START ME UP	Phillies: Philadelphia starters haven't earned a win since May 23 at Washington.	Orioles: Chen's outing ended a run of 14 straight games in which Baltimore starters failed to go seven innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: RHP Chad Billingsley (forearm) is scheduled to make rehab starts for Triple-A Lehigh Valley on Tuesday and Sunday before being re-evaluated, Sandberg said.	Orioles: 2B Jonathan Schoop (sprained right knee) will launch his rehab assignment Friday with Double-A Bowie. "We're not going to activate him until we're 100 percent sure" he's ready Showalter said.	ON DECK	Phillies: Jerome Williams (3-6) seeks his first win in six starts on Tuesday night in the series finale before the teams travel to Philadelphia.	Orioles: Chris Tillman (4-7) makes his first career appearance against the Phillies.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DETROIT --  If Anibal Sanchez is indeed turning his season around, Detroit's starting rotation suddenly looks a lot more imposing.	Sanchez was outstanding for a second straight start, throwing a two-hit shutout to lift the Tigers to a 6-0 victory over the Cincinnati Reds on Monday night. Detroit has won six of eight after an eight-game losing streak that dropped the Tigers to .500.	The Tigers' starters haven't been as intimidating as in years past, but Detroit recently got Justin Verlander back from the disabled list, and Sanchez did not allow a base runner after the fourth inning Monday.	"Getting Ver, I think, was a big boost," manager Brad Ausmus said. "If we have the Anibal Sanchez we were hoping to see the rest of the way, then I think our starting rotation is very strong."	Sanchez (5-7) struck out seven without a walk. The right-hander did not get off to a good start this season, but his past two outings have been a major step in the right direction. He held the Chicago Cubs scoreless for 7 2/3 innings last Tuesday, and Monday's effort lowered his ERA to 4.65.	Cincinnati starter Jon Moscot had to leave the game in the first after dislocating his non-throwing shoulder while tagging out a runner. Pedro Villarreal (0-1) pitched 3 1/3 innings of relief and kept the Reds in the game, but Detroit scored four in the sixth off Nate Adcock.	Miguel Cabrera hit a two-run double and J.D. Martinez added a two-run homer in that inning.	Detroit is still in third place in the AL Central, but an effective Sanchez would be a big help as the Tigers try to win their fifth straight division crown. The Reds managed only two singles off Sanchez, who threw 112 pitches and faced one batter over the minimum.	It was the seventh shutout of Sanchez's career, but his first complete game since May 24, 2013, when he had a no-hit bid broken up in the ninth inning against Minnesota.	"I think right now more important is the team wins," Sanchez said. "It's not about my career or if I threw a complete game last year or two years ago. I think the more important thing is I feel really good, I'm healthy, and I'm going to continue to battle."	Moscot was making his third career start when Cabrera hit a comebacker with one out in the first. The right-hander caught Anthony Gose between second and third, and he chased the Detroit runner all the way back to second before diving forward to tag him. Moscot was slow getting up and had to leave the game.	"I've been a part of a season here or there where we've had a lot of injuries, but never anything like this back-to-back seasons," Reds manager Bryan Price said. "He does everything right, freezes the runner and even makes a diving tag, and now he's going to be out for a while. That's really tough to see."	The Tigers opened the scoring with an unearned run in the fourth. Yoenis Cespedes hit a two-out double over Brennan Boesch's head in left. Then Martinez hit a grounder to third that Todd Frazier threw away. The play was scored a single and an error, and Cespedes scored.	After the Tigers added four runs in the sixth, Cespedes hit an RBI single in the seventh to make it 6-0.	TOUGH BOUNCE	Reds C Tucker Barnhart was on deck when Eugenio Suarez fouled a pitch back and hit him. Barnhart was unhurt.	"I'm lucky it hit me in the chest -- I didn't have a chance on that one," Barnhart said. "I'll have a bruise, but that's it."	COURAGEOUS	Former Michigan football coach Lloyd Carr's grandson Chad was honored before the game at the ceremonial first pitch. He has been fighting a pediatric brain tumor.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: Moscot's injury came on the same day Cincinnati put LHP Tony Cingrani on the DL with a strained left shoulder. That move was retroactive to Sunday. Reds SS Zack Cozart had surgery Monday on his right knee. His rehab is expected to begin Tuesday and will take approximately seven to nine months.	Tigers: Detroit reinstated RP Bruce Rondon (bicipital tendinitis) from the DL and optioned him to Triple-A Toledo.	UP NEXT	Detroit LHP Kyle Ryan (1-0) faces Cincinnati RHP Michael Lorenzen (1-2) on Tuesday night.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

NEW YORK -- The Mets trailed early, blew a ninth-inning lead and fell behind again in extras -- all against baseball's hottest team.	Still, in the end, they remained perfect in New York against the Blue Jays.	Wilmer Flores singled to cap a two-out, two-run rally in the 11th inning, and the Mets ended Toronto's team record-tying 11-game winning streak, beating the Blue Jays 4-3 Monday night.	The Mets improved to 10-0 at home against the Blue Jays with the comeback victory.	"It's resiliency," Michael Cuddyer said. "We know we're always going to be in the game."	The Blue Jays trailed 2-1 in the ninth before Jose Bautista tied it with his second home run of the game, connecting against Jeurys Familia.	Toronto took the lead in the 11th on Dioner Navarro's sacrifice fly off Hansel Robles (1-1). The Mets then rallied for their fourth win in five games. They trailed 8-3 Sunday before beating Atlanta.	With Ruben Tejada on first and one out, Cuddyer hit a potential game-ending double-play grounder to second baseman Danny Valencia. Tejada smartly slowed up and Valencia tagged him, but too late to throw onto first.	"That piece of baserunning, that's how you're supposed to run the bases," manager Terry Collins said.	Lucas Duda followed by slicing a shift-busting single to shallow left field, and the 36-year-old Cuddyer hustled all the way home.	Duda took second on the throw, Liam Hendriks relieved and Flores lined the first pitch up the middle, setting off a raucous celebration near second base.	"We're not giving up," Flores said. "That's what good teams do."	The Mets were the only other team in the majors with an 11-game winning streak this season. New York's perfect 10-0 record against Toronto is tied with Cleveland for third longest in interleague play. San Francisco has two 11-game runs, against Oakland and Texas, according to information provided by the Mets from the Elias Sports Bureau.	Familia was trying for a four-out save for the second straight day. He wound up with his second blown save this season, spoiling a dominant start by Noah Syndergaard.	"It wasn't a bad pitch. This guy is just one of the great home run hitters in baseball," Collins said of Bautista's homer off Familia.	Pitching on an extra day's rest, the rookie right-hander nicknamed Thor struck out a career-high 11 and allowed two hits in six overpowering innings. Syndergaard, traded by the Blue Jays to the Mets, left with a 2-1 lead against the team that racked up 88 runs in reeling off 11 consecutive wins.	"The kid tonight was great," Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. "They shut down a hot offense, and that hasn't been easy to do lately."	Bautista hit a mammoth homer into the second deck in left field with two outs in the first, but Toronto's relentless offense was stifled by Syndergaard and relievers Carlos Torres and Jack Leathersich through 7⅔ innings.	Syndergaard was the starter a week ago when San Francisco's Chris Heston pitched a no-hitter at Citi Field. This time against Mark Buehrle, the Mets went without a baserunner until Duda led off the fifth with a sharp grounder that hopped over the glove of first baseman Edwin Encarnacion, who went down to one knee to try to catch the ball.	New York broke through against Buehrle in the sixth, taking advantage of former Mets star Jose Reyes' throwing error from deep shortstop on Kevin Plawecki's grounder to open the inning.	Juan Lagares and Tejada each had RBI doubles in the sixth.	Buehrle allowed four hits and two runs in seven innings. The Mets are the only team Buehrle hasn't beaten in his 16-year career, all in the American League, except for one season with Miami.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: RHP Aaron Sanchez was put on the 15-day disabled list with a mild lat strain. Gibbons hopes Sanchez will miss just one more start and will be able to pitch the next time his turns comes up on June 21, the day he is eligible to come off the DL.	Mets: RHP Vic Black has a minor groin injury, which has delayed his rehab from a shoulder injury, general manager Sandy Alderson said.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays: RHP Scott Copeland will make his second start in place of Sanchez. In his first career start Wednesday, Copeland gave up one run and six hits over seven innings against the Marlins.	Mets: RHP Matt Harvey is coming off a poor start, allowing seven runs and nine hits in six innings. He was tagged for three homers and has given up 12 longballs in his first 12 starts.	UMPIRE HURT	Home plate umpire Marty Foster left the game after being hit in the facemask by a foul ball in the third inning. The game was delayed for 11 minutes. Foster was struck squarely on the mask by a ball off the bat of Toronto's Josh Donaldson with one out. Crew chief Mike Winters, who was working at second base, took over at home in the bottom half.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MIAMI --  When Alex Rodriguez emerged from the dugout to pinch-hit with two out in the ninth inning Monday, the resulting roar from his hometown fans gave Miami Marlins closer A.J. Ramos a boost of adrenaline.	"That was the loudest I've heard in this stadium," Ramos said. "I kind of took it in. You've got to take those moments in. I was like, `Man, this is really cool."	The conflicted crowd was cheering again moments later, this time for the home team. Ramos got Rodriguez to fly out, and the Marlins beat the New York Yankees 2-1.	Rodriguez, who batted for Stephen Drew with a runner at first, said the last time he received such a rousing ovation as a visiting player might have been in high school. He lofted a 1-1 slider to right field and remained five hits shy of 3,000.	"It was an incredible moment," Rodriguez said, "an absolute awesome situation to be in. Fun. Exciting. I had a good pitch to hit and just popped it straight up."	Playing in his hometown for the first time since 2009, Rodriguez didn't start because there was no DH for the interleague game. But manager Joe Girardi gave him a chance to be a ninth-inning hero.	"It would have been a nice little story," Girardi said. "Didn't happen, though."	Rodriguez is not expected to start in the Yankees' final game in Miami on Tuesday either.	Tom Koehler pitched seven innings for Miami and was helped by acrobatic defense. Derek Dietrich, recalled from the minors last week, hit his first home run of the season in the seventh to put Miami ahead against Masahiro Tanaka.	The crowd of 33,961 -- Miami's largest since opening day -- included a busload of Rodriguez's family and friends, as he described it. Fans seemed evenly divided in their support of the Marlins and the Yankees.	Mark Teixeira hit his 18th homer for the Yankees in the second inning. That was the only run allowed by Koehler (5-4), who limited the AL East leaders to three hits thanks to his teammates.	Shortstop Adeiny Hechavarria had two leaping catches of line drives to rob Chase Headley of hits, and second baseman Dee Gordon also contributed two nifty stops.	"Hech made two great plays, and Dee didn't want to be outdone," Koehler said.	The Yankees tied a season low with three hits.	"Really good defensive plays on their part," Girardi said. "I though we actually swung the bats pretty good, and really didn't have much to show for it."	Tanaka (4-2) allowed nine hits and two runs in seven innings.	The Marlins' Ichiro Suzuki had two hits against former teammate Tanaka in an all-Japanese matchup. The game was televised in Japan.	Miami's Carter Capps struck out the side in the eighth and topped out at 100 mph. A.J. Ramos pitched around a leadoff walk in the ninth for his ninth save in 12 chances.	"It's probably the coolest save I've gotten so far," Ramos said. "Hopefully I get cooler ones, but as of right now this is probably the best one."	Giancarlo Stanton, who leads the majors in homers and RBI, went 1 for 3. Stanton, who suffered a season-ending beaning last September, was hit in the lower back by Jose Ramirez in the eighth inning but stayed in the game.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: RHP Ivan Nova will make at least one more rehabilitation start in the minors before rejoining the rotation, Girardi said. Nova is recovering from Tommy John surgery in April 2014. "We just think it's better that we know he's ready to go and ready to handle the rigors of starting every fifth day," Girardi said. ... OF Carlos Beltran was held out of the starting lineup because of a sore hamstring. He pinch-hit in the eighth and struck out.	Marlins: 3B Martin Prado sat out with a sore right shoulder. He's at least a day or two away from trying to throw, and a stint on the disabled list hasn't been ruled out.	UP NEXT	Yankees RHP Nathan Eovaldi (5-1, 4.13) and Marlins RHP David Phelps (3-3, 4.11) swapped teams as part of a five-player trade in December, and they're scheduled to start against each other Tuesday.	"It would work out that way," Phelps said.	Eovaldi went 6-14 at Marlins Park with Miami.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Strong pitching has the Tampa Bay Rays in first place.	Erasmo Ramirez pitched six scoreless innings and the Rays beat the Washington Nationals 6-1 on Monday night.	Ramirez (6-2) won for the sixth time in his last seven starts following a winless stretch of 25 games that included 15 starts.	"Just happy with what's going on right now," Ramirez said.	Tampa Bay won for the 12th time in 16 games to take a one-game lead in the AL East over the New York Yankees, who lost 2-1 at Miami. The Rays have held opponents to two or fewer runs in 32 of 65 games.	Tampa Bay slugger Evan Longoria left with a bruised left wrist after being hit by a Taylor Hill pitch in the fifth. X-rays were negative. The ball hit the same sore spot that kept him out of the lineup for three games early this month.	"I wouldn't rule out the possibility of playing (Tuesday)," said Longoria, who had the wrist wrapped postgame. "There's nothing seriously wrong there. It's a matter of seeing how I feel when I wake up."	Gio Gonzalez (4-4) gave up five runs and eight hits over 3 1/3 innings for the Nationals.	"You've got team that's red-hot right now," Gonzalez said. "You fall behind and give them a chance to score some runs, they're going to do it."	Washington slugger Bryce Harper returned to the lineup and went 0 for 4 with two strikeouts and a walk as the designated hitter. He got hit on the inside of his left leg above the knee in the ninth inning Saturday by a 95 mph fastball from Milwaukee reliever Michael Blazek and didn't play Sunday.	The Nationals got a bases-loaded RBI single from Yunel Escobar in the ninth before Harper lined into a game-ending double play.	The Rays chased Gonzalez in the fourth when Longoria had a sacrifice fly and Logan Forsythe added a run-scoring single to make it 5-0.	Tampa Bay went up 3-0 with a two-run third as Forsythe had an RBI single that went off Gonzalez's heel and Jake Elmore hit a sacrifice fly.	Kevin Kiermaier's hustle helped the Rays take a 1-0 lead in the second. Running hard out of the box, Kiermaier turned what looked a routine single to center into a double. He then stole third and scored on Rene Rivera's sacrifice fly.	Brandon Guyer had a fifth-inning RBI triple for the Rays.	Harper drew a two-out walk in the third to load the bases, but Ramirez got out of the jam by getting a grounder from Wilson Ramos. Clint Robinson lined out to first with the bases loaded to end the fifth.	Tampa Bay's Steven Souza Jr. tied a team record by walking five times. Strangely. He was left stranded on base all five times.	"That's the way the game is sometimes," Souza said. "It's just weird.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: Escobar got hit on the right hand by Ramirez's pitch in the third, but remained in the game.	Rays: LHP Matt Moore (elbow ligament replacement surgery) had his third rehab start for Class A Charlotte postponed by rain.	UP NEXT	Rays RHP Alex Colome (3-2) and Nationals RHP Tanner Roark (2-2) are Tuesday night's scheduled starters. Colome has gone six or more innings three times this season and is 0-2 with a 7.00 ERA in those outings.	MOVING DAY	Rays C Bobby Wilson cleared waivers and accepted an outright assignment to Triple-A Durham. He will join the International League club Thursday.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Rougned Odor spent five weeks back in the minor leagues after struggling early in the season for the Texas Rangers.	The young second baseman made an impactful return Monday night, with a big two-run single among his three hits, while Yovani Gallardo threw seven scoreless innings in the Rangers' 4-1 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers.	"How about the young man coming back, first night with the hits, but more importantly the big one," manager Jeff Banister said with a smile. "Get him back up here on night one, you see the adjustments, and it paid off for us."	Odor was recalled from Triple-A Round Rock earlier Monday when outfielder Delino DeShields was put on the 15-day disabled list with a strained left hamstring.	Gallardo (6-6) struck out four and walked three while allowing four hits.  The right-hander has won all three of his decisions over his last five starts, and has allowed only five earned runs over 32 innings in that span.	After walking the first two batters of the sixth in what was still a scoreless game, Gallardo got Yasiel Puig on an adventurous flyball before Adrian Gonzalez grounded into a double play.	"I'm throwing the ball well right now. I had a good slider and cutter," Gallardo said. "I think I was just trying to be a little bit too fine (in the sixth). ... But I made some pitches. The guys played great defense behind me."	The Rangers got all of their runs in the bottom of that same inning off Carlos Frias (4-4).	"He was cruising and then all of a sudden a four-pitch walk," manager Don Mattingly said. "And he got himself in trouble quick with the next guy. ... He kept leaving the ball up."	Fielder and Mitch Moreland, with a 10-game hitting streak, had consecutive RBI singles before Elvis Andrus' sac bunt. Odor greeted reliever Adam Liberatore by going the opposite way through the left side of the infield to make it 4-0.	"I've been working in Triple-A a lot on that, hitting the ball to the other side," Odor said. "I feel good with everything right now."	When sent down, he had hit .144 with 25 strikeouts after starting 25 of the Rangers' first 31 games at second base. He then hit .355 with five homers in 107 at-bats in 30 games at Round Rock.	Shawn Tolleson worked the ninth for his ninth save in as many chances, a day after giving up a ninth-inning run in a tie game that became a 4-3 home loss to Minnesota.	Rangers reliever Tanner Scheppers gave up a long homer to Yasmani Grandal on the first pitch he threw after taking over in the eighth.	The Dodgers still had two on with one out in the eighth when Puig struck out for the third time and then snapped the bat over his leg in frustration. Puig also shattered a light in the tunnel leading out of the dugout when he slammed the broken bat there.	With two on the sixth, Puig hit a towering flyball to right that Shin-Soo Choo initially couldn't find. Choo recovered, backpedaling with his glove arm extended as far as possible when making the catch.	KERSHAW GETS HOMETOWN TEAM AT HOME	Three-time NL Cy Young Award winner and Dallas native Clayton Kershaw is scheduled to pitch against the Rangers -- on Wednesday in Dodger Stadium, instead in the stadium he grew up going to games. The only game he has played at the Rangers' ballpark was while in high school, and he was at first base.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: RHP Pedro Baez (pectoral muscle) is scheduled to throw live BP on Tuesday and then likely a bullpen session in Los Angeles after that.

MILWAUKEE --  Kansas City's collection of former Brewers made a triumphant return to Milwaukee, though normally lights-out reliever Greg Holland made the win more difficult than expected.	Lorenzo Cain hit a two-run homer, but the Royals needed Wade Davis to finish off an 8-5 win Monday night after Holland struggled in the ninth.	"I left some pitches in the middle of the plate that you can't do when you're ahead in the count," Holland said.	The Royals held on in manager Ned Yost's first regular season game back in Milwaukee since being fired by the Brewers late in the 2008 campaign.	A couple of other former Brewers chipped in with Cain and shortstop Alcides Escobar each getting two hits and two RBI.	But Holland's difficult night turned what was an 8-2 game going into the bottom of the ninth into an unexpected thriller.	After running into tough luck at the plate for much of the night, the Brewers were finally able to string together hits in a three-run ninth off Holland. The closer pitching in a non-save situation had his first outing in six days.	"It's rust. That's my fault," Yost said.	Jonathan Lucroy's second double of the game made it 8-5 to chase Holland from the game. Holland's ERA ballooned from 1.76 to 3.52 after allowing three runs on four hits and a walk.	Adam Lind nearly broke through against Davis with a liner up the middle that was snared by Escobar for an out. Davis held on for his eighth save, stranding runners on second and third.	"Our guys put good at-bats together against two really good pitchers," manager Craig Counsell said. "We made them work for it."	The Royals had set the tone until the ninth. Mike Moustakas drove in leadoff hitter Escobar with a single in a three-run first inning with Escobar running on the pitch from first.	Cain tacked on his two-run shot in the fifth, his fifth of the season, off starter Kyle Lohse (3-8) for a 5-0 lead.	It was just enough of a cushion for starter Edinson Volquez (6-4), who allowed six hits and two runs in five shaky innings. The damage could have been worse if not for a couple inning-ending double plays and other well-hit balls right at fielders.	ROYAL RETURN	Cain and Escobar each played last played for the Brewers in 2010. They've turned into key players for the Royals.	"Every day I go out and play hard, try the best I can do," Escobar said. "Don't try to be too much, just play, enjoy the game."	In the first, Escobar was originally ruled out on a play at the plate before Yost's challenge led to the call being overturned to give Kansas City a 1-0 lead.	LOSING LOSHE	Lohse gave up five runs and five hits in five innings. His ERA rose to 6.44.	He had some bad luck, too, after a couple bouncers glanced off the gloves of fielders for hits.	Home runs, though, continue to be a problem. Cain's shot was the 16th allowed by Lohse this season.	"I'm not that far away. I know it is ugly, but it is just make a pitch here and there," the veteran said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals: Yost said SP Yordano Ventura (right hand weakness) threw the ball well during a 35-pitch bullpen session. He left Saturday's game against St. Louis because of the injury. A rainout Sunday with the Cardinals gave the Royals more flexibility with their rotation, and Yost said he would likely push Ventura's next start back to Friday against the Red Sox in Kansas City.	Brewers: CF Carlos Gomez was scratched from the lineup with right leg tightness. The leg has bothered Gomez since he spent two weeks on the disabled list in late April with a hamstring injury. Gomez also missed a few games last week because of an injury that now seems to be concentrated to the upper part of the leg. Gomez might miss a couple games this week, manager Craig Counsell said.	UP NEXT	Royals: Chris Young (5-2) makes the start on Tuesday in his first appearance since carrying a no-hitter into the seventh inning of a 2-0 win at Minnesota on June 9. Young has a 2.08 ERA in 26 innings on the road this year.	Brewers: Matt Garza (4-7) is 2-5 with a 3.45 ERA in nine career starts against Kansas City.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

HOUSTON --  On a night when he homered twice, George Springer was more proud of his defense for the Houston Astros.	"Because that's an opportunity to help us out even more," Springer said.	Springer made two nifty catches in right field to pair with his big night at the plate, Colby Rasmus hit a three-run homer and the Astros beat the Colorado Rockies 6-3 on Monday night.	"George is playing complete baseball I think on both sides of the ball and we're watching him mature right before our eyes and he's an exciting player when puts things together like this," manager A.J. Hinch said of the second-year player.	Rasmus gave the Astros a 4-0 lead with his shot in the first inning and Springer hit solo home runs in the second and seventh. Rasmus was placed on the bereavement list after the game following the death of his grandmother and outfielder Domingo Santana was recalled to take his spot on the roster.	Dallas Keuchel (8-2) retired the first 15 Colorado batters. He wound up allowing four hits and left after an RBI double by Nick Hundley pulled the Rockies within 5-3 with two outs in the seventh.	Luke Gregerson allowed one hit in a scoreless ninth for his 16th save.	Chad Bettis (2-2) gave up seven hits and a season-high five runs in five innings. He hadn't allowed a homer this season and the two he gave up on Monday tie a career high.	"This team in general is just very aggressive," Bettis said. "That was kind of their motto coming into the game and it showed. Didn't have a very good feel for my off-speed and got hurt for it."	The Astros, who lead the majors with 88 home runs, improved to 24-0 this season when hitting more than one homer.	It was the second career multihomer game for Springer, who finished with three hits. Rookie Carlos Correa had his first career three-hit game, all singles.	Houston opened the game with three straight singles, capped by one from Preston Tucker, to make it 1-0. The homer by Rasmus came with one out.	Springer's homer to the Crawford Boxes in left field pushed the lead to 5-0 in the second.	Keuchel was perfect through five innings before walking Rafael Ynoa to start the sixth. Hundley followed with a single.	"I just ran out of gas there in the sixth inning and that was unfortunate," Keuchel said.	Ynoa was robbed of a hit in the third inning when Springer made a diving grab in shallow right. Springer displayed his sparkling defense again in the sixth when he made another diving catch, this one on a ball hit hard by DJ LeMahieu.	Troy Tulowitzki and Nolan Arenado hit back to back RBI singles after that to cut the lead to 5-2.	Springer's second homer came off LaTroy Hawkins to start the seventh inning.	This was Keuchel's 25th straight start of six innings or longer, the longest such streak in the majors.	TUCKER AND TUCKER	The Astros signed Kyle Tucker, who was the fifth overall pick in this year's draft. The left-handed outfielder joins brother Preston in the organization. Kyle was thrilled to take batting practice with his big brother before the game.	"It was awesome," Kyle said. "I got to hit with him a little bit and talk to some of the guys and get a little bit of a relationship with them."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: All-Star second baseman Jose Altuve sat out for the third straight game with a strained right hamstring. Manager Hinch said Altuve was feeling "great" on Monday, but that he decided to give him an extra day off as a precaution. He expects him to be back in the lineup on Tuesday.	UP NEXT	Houston rookie Vince Velasquez opposes left-hander Chris Rusin when the short two-game series wraps up on Tuesday. Velasquez pitched five scoreless innings in his major league debut on Wednesday, but didn't factor into the decision.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

ST. LOUIS --  Yadier Molina finally got ahold of one, and the six-time All-Star catcher called a pretty good game, too.	Molina homered for the first time this season and John Lackey worked eight strong innings for the St. Louis Cardinals, who won their fourth in a row with a 3-2 victory over the Minnesota Twins on Monday night.	Manager Mike Matheny said it's been a bigger issue outside the team, but noted "Sooner or later that wears on you, especially a guy that's been able to hit 20 before.	"And everybody wants to talk about everything on the outside that might be influencing it, whether it's his diet or his exercise program -- whatever it is that's not giving him the power."	Molina left Busch Stadium without speaking with reporters. His manager said it for him.	"He hit four balls on the button and finally got one that carried a little better," Matheny said.	Mark Reynolds connected three pitches ahead of Molina in the fourth, giving the Cardinals back-to-back homers.	Randal Grichuk tripled, singled and scored for St. Louis, which is 42-21 overall and 25-7 at home -- both major league bests. The Cardinals have won 15 of 20.	"It was a National League-type game and it's the type of games the Cardinals have been winning consistently this year," Twins manager Paul Molitor said. "Well pitched and well defended. Their bullpen stood up after Lackey gave them a very good outing."	Twins rookie Byron Buxton tripled for his first career hit with one out in the eighth and scored on a sacrifice fly by Brian Dozier that cut the gap to a run. Buxton also slammed into the wall, but didn't stay down long, after just missing a running catch on Grichuk's triple leading off the third.	"I was just giving it my all and trying to help my pitcher out," Buxton said. "I'm OK. Nothing is sore."	Fellow rookie Trevor May, the starter, appreciated the effort.	"I told him, `Man, that's not what we're asking," May said. "He's a guy who's not afraid to run through a wall to get you an out."	Molina dropped about 20 pounds in the offseason, reporting at 220 pounds, and his power profile has suffered. Manager Mike Matheny said before the game the lack of a long ball likely bothered Molina more than fans or teammates.	He averaged 16 homers over a three-year period from 2011-13 before dropping off to seven last season.	Lackey (5-4) bounced back smartly on six days' rest after getting torched for 10 earned runs in four innings at Colorado. Lackey, whose start was postponed a day by a rainout Sunday, allowed two runs on five hits with six strikeouts and a walk.	Lackey said he missed Reynolds homer live because he was "in the bathroom," but added, "The replay was nice on both of them."	Kevin Siegrist finished for his second save in three chances. Closer Trevor Rosenthal, who leads the NL with 21 saves, was unavailable due to stiffness and did not warm up.	Matheny said Rosenthal also would have been unavailable on Sunday, a game rained out against Kansas City, but was hopeful the right-hander could pitch on Tuesday.	"Just one of those days when the arm didn't feel right and we needed to give him a day," Matheny said.	May (4-5) gave up a total of four homers his first 11 starts. He allowed three runs in five innings, ending a run of five consecutive starts of six or more.	UP NEXT	Kyle Gibson is 1-1 with a 4.82 ERA his last three starts, all at home. The Cardinals are averaging 6.3 runs for Michael Wacha, among the best in the league.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: RHP Lance Lynn (forearm strain) remains on track to return from the 15-day DL on time June 23.	Twins: Torii Hunter returned from a two-game suspension.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  For the third time in four days, an Arizona starter held an opponent hitless through the first five innings.	Chase Anderson and Allen Webster did it during a three-game sweep in San Francisco, and Robbie Ray followed in the opener against the Los Angeles Angels.	Ray allowed two hits over seven scoreless innings in his 10th major league start, and the Diamondbacks got home runs from Paul Goldschmidt and Yasmany Tomas in a 7-3 victory over the defending AL West champions on Monday night.	"Robbie did a great job tonight," Goldschmidt said. "When a guy's putting up a lot of zeros, you're going to get a chance offensively because it puts pressure on their pitcher to be perfect as well. And when we have the lead, Robbie can be a lot more aggressive and not worry about solo homers and stuff like that."	Ray (2-1) struck out three and walked two in his fourth start of the season, dropping his ERA to 1.09. The 23-year-old left-hander allowed only one batter to reach base through the first 5 2/3 innings. That was on a four-pitch walk in the fourth to reigning AL MVP Mike Trout, who was quickly erased on an inning-ending double-play grounder by Albert Pujols.	"I didn't throw many off-speed pitches and I just stayed on the fastball and attacked hitters," Ray said. "Me and my catcher (Wellington Castillo) had a game plan going, we stuck to it, and the team was making plays behind me."	Ray retired his first two batters in the sixth on popups to first base before No. 9 hitter Daniel Robertson -- the only player Angels player who had faced him before -- broke up the no-hit bid with a clean single to right-center field. Erick Aybar then singled inside third base, but was thrown out at second by left fielder Cliff Pennington.	Pennington was in the game because D-backs right fielder and leadoff hitter Ender Inciarte was taken out with a right hamstring strain, after trying to beat out a first-inning grounder to first that Pujols fielded wide of the bag before tossing to pitcher Jered Weaver. Inciarte was placed on the 15-day disabled list after the game.	"I've never had a hamstring issue, so it's really disappointing," Inciarte said. "Nobody wants to go on the DL. ... But they're doing what they know is best for me, so I'll do whatever they say. ... Hopefully I'll get better soon and start playing games again in 15 days."	Weaver (4-7) was charged with five runs -- four earned -- and eight hits in seven innings, including Goldschmidt's 18th homer and Tomas' third, which helped Arizona build a 5-0 lead.	"I don't know what it is. Maybe my stuff is a little flat. Maybe I'm going with too many off-speed pitches," said Weaver, who has given up 16 homers this season and seven in his last four starts. "It's obviously frustrating. ... I've just gotta find my way out of it and keep grinding."	The Angels pulled to 5-3 with three runs in the eighth. Kyle Kubitza scored on Addison Reed's bases-loaded wild pitch to Trout, who doubled home two more against the right-hander before Pujols' bid for a tying two-run homer was caught on the warning track by center fielder A.J. Pollock.	The D-backs tacked on two runs in the ninth on Pennington's suicide-squeeze bunt single and Pollock's sacrifice fly, but Reed got the last four outs for his third save of the season.	Goldschmidt gave Arizona a 3-0 lead in the third with a towering drive to center field after Weaver gave up a leadoff walk to Castillo and a two-out walk to Pollock. Goldschmidt, a two-time All-Star, had three hits to ncrease his major league-leading average to. 366 and has reached base safely in 25 straight games.	Goldschmidt, who leads the D-backs with 53 RBI, was denied another one in the seventh when Robertson fielded his two-out single and threw out Pennington at the plate. Robertson was playing in his second game with the Angels, who acquired him from Texas last November.	Weaver called trainer Rick Smith to the mound in the fourth inning to attend to a problem he was having with his thumb after giving up a one-out single by Jake Lamb, but was given the green light to continue.	Weaver came in 16-5 with a 2.68 ERA in his 31 previous interleague starts, including a 12-3 win against the D-backs at Chase Field on June 26, 2009.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: 3B David Freese was limited to DH duty for the second straight game because of a hamstring issue. Manager Mike Scioscia said he would be back at third on Wednesday and Thursday nights, when the Angels play at Arizona and there is no DH.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: RHP Jeremy Hellickson (4-3) has failed to pitch seven full innings in any of his last 21 starts since Aug. 6, 2014. He is 3-0 in his last four outings despite a 4.84 ERA during that stretch.	Angels: RHP Garrett Richards (6-4) is coming off a 6-2 road victory against Tampa Bay in which he allowed two runs over seven innings and struck out seven.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN FRANCISCO --  The Seattle Mariners pushed it on the bases and produced the timely hits to add on late in the game, and they got a stellar start from Taijuan Walker.	"A little life in this team, how about that?" manager Lloyd McClendon quipped.	Kyle Seager hit his 11th home run with a solo shot in the eighth, Walker struck out six in seven innings and the Mariners beat the San Francisco Giants 5-1 on Monday night.	Logan Morrison hit a go-ahead single in the fifth to support Walker (4-6), who outpitched Tim Hudson to win consecutive starts for the first time all season. The right-hander earned his first interleague victory after going 0-3 in his first three.	Afterward, ace and prankster Felix Hernandez -- who will oppose World Series MVP Madison Bumgarner on Wednesday when the interleague series shifts to Safeco Field -- tossed pop-its in the lively, loose clubhouse.	The Mariners bounced back after they were blanked 13-0 a day earlier at Houston, sending San Francisco to its ninth straight home defeat. That's the longest in San Francisco history and worst since the franchise's 11-game skid at New York's Polo Grounds from Sept. 11-19, 1940.	World Series champion San Francisco lost its fifth straight overall for its third losing streak of five or more this season.	The Mariners added on in the fifth on a fielding blunder when second baseman Joe Panik scurried backward and tried to catch Austin Jackson's popup in shallow center but missed the ball. It didn't appear center fielder Angel Pagan called him off, while right fielder Jarrett Parker also hustled to the play.	Jackson singled home an insurance run in the ninth.	"Listen, it's been an adventure at times for us on the bases," McClendon said. "We have to have the ability to add on. That's what keeps teams at bay. When we have a lead and add on, it quiets their spirit a little bit."	The teams played once previously at AT&T Park, during the ballpark's opening season in 2000 when Seattle took two of three from June 9-11 that year. It was 58 degrees for first pitch this time in mid-June, pretty typical for a San Francisco summer.	Seattle's leadoff hitter reached on a single in four of the first six innings against Hudson (4-6), who allowed eight hits and three runs in five innings.	"We need more of that," Morrison said of aggressive baserunning.	Hudson, receiving one or zero runs of support for the eighth time in 13 starts, lost his 23rd career interleague game to match Derek Lowe and Barry Zito for most all time.	Nori Aoki hit an infield single in the second for the Giants' lone run after Seattle went ahead in the first on Nelson Cruz's grounder.	The Giants have been outscored 45-17 during their home skid. They lost against the American League at home for only the third time in 14 regular-season games since the beginning of 2014.	"You get in a skid like this, sometimes they do press," manager Bruce Bochy said. "Why at home? That is hard to explain. ... We just can't generate anything."	San Francisco's Angel Pagan snapped an 0-for-19 hitless stretch with his first-inning single.	CRAWFORD'S GLOVE	Giants shortstop Brandon Crawford made a trio of snazzy plays in a 1-2-3 seventh. He made a diving stop on Morrison's grounder, then another nice throw on a groundball by Jackson before catching Robinson Cano's hard liner.	"Pretty impressive," McClendon said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: LF Mark Trumbo was receiving treatment for his back spasms after they forced him to be a late scratch from Sunday's game. ... RHP Hisashi Iwakuma threw a three-inning simulated game at Safeco Field and is set to start for Class-A Everett on Saturday. He also will join Triple-A Tacoma before rejoining the Mariners from a stint with a strained lat muscle. ... LHP James Paxton, on the DL since May 29 with a strained left middle finger, is set to begin playing catch next week.	Giants: OF Gregor Blanco hasn't experienced any dizziness since Sunday morning and was riding the stationary bike again Monday as he recovers from a concussion. He is eligible to come off the seven-day list Tuesday, but it likely will be more like Wednesday or Thursday. ... RHP Matt Cain (elbow) struck out seven, walked two and allowed three earned runs on six hits in 3 1/3 innings in his rehab start for Triple-A Sacramento. ... RHP Jake Peavy (lower back) will start for Sacramento on Tuesday.	UP NEXT	Mariners: LHP J.A. Happ (3-2) looks to bounce back from the shortest start of his career at 2 1/3 innings at Cleveland on June 11.	Giants: Tim Lincecum (6-3) will face his hometown team in the afternoon finale before the clubs shift to Seattle for two games.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ST. LOUIS --  Before the first pitch, manager Mike Matheny noted there are distractions every day for the St. Louis Cardinals. This, he maintained, was just another one.	A federal investigation into possible computer hacking by the team becoming news Monday failed to slow down the team with the major leagues' best record.	The Cardinals extended their winning streak to five by beating the Minnesota Twins 3-2 behind Michael Wacha's pitching and Mark Reynolds' two-run single.	"We're cooperating and I think they understand it really has nothing to do with us inside the clubhouse right now," Matheny said. "Our job is to stay focused on what we can do each day, and let that process take care of itself."	Before the game, Matheny said he was in the weight room when he first learned of the investigation into whether the Cardinals had hacked Houston's computer database. The Cardinals then completed a soggy homestand in which three games were delayed and another against Kansas City was postponed until July 23.	St. Louis is 43-22 overall and 26-7 at home, both tops in the majors, and matched a franchise best by reaching 43 wins in 64 games.	Minnesota has lost seven of eight and was 1-4 on a trip that featured the debut of Byron Buxton, the second overall pick in 2012.	"He is just one player and he's played really well and it's been awesome to see him up here, that's for sure," Twins starter Kyle Gibson said. "We're definitely excited for how he's going to help the team, and he's going to."	Wacha (9-2) halted warmups before the first pitch was delayed 45 minutes and didn't return after a 47-minute rain delay with one out in the seventh and the Cardinals leading 3-1. He allowed two runs on three hits in 6 1/3 innings.	Wacha endured six weather delays totaling more than six hours last season, so the rain Tuesday was nothing new.	"You just kind of have a sense of what to expect," Wacha said. "I just stayed mentally ready as well as physically.	"You know, it's not the first time I went through it."	Kevin Siegrist stood in for Trevor Rosenthal, who is sidelined by a knot in his biceps, and pitched the ninth for his third save in four chances.	Matheny thought Rosenthal looked better but needed another day, and didn't think the injury would require a stint on the 15-day disabled list.	"They've ruled out anything structural, it's just one of those times during the season and it just so happened on two nights when he typically would be needed," Matheny said. "It's great to see Kevin Siegrist step up once again."	Yadier Molina doubled for his fourth hit in two games and scored on Randal Grichuk's sacrifice fly in the second, and Reynolds' single gave St. Louis a 3-1 lead in the third.	Trevor Plouffe had an RBI double in the first and Kurt Suzuki doubled in a run in the seventh after Seth Maness relieved. Gibson (4-5) allowed three runs and six hits in six innings.	Buxton was easily thrown out stealing by Yadier Molina after reaching on an infield hit leading off the eighth. Matheny said reliever Matt Belisle made it difficult for the rookie to get a good jump.	"The guy was really quick to home," Twins manager Paul Molitor said. "It didn't work out."	UP NEXT	The teams play at Minnesota on Wednesday and Thursday. Tommy Milone worked seven innings his last time out, allowing only a two-run homer to Elvis Andrus. In his only prior appearance against the Cardinals, he matched a career high surrendering three homers on June 30, 2013, in Oakland. With Carlos Martinez pitching, the Cardinals are 10-2. He's 7-2 with a 2.93 ERA in his first year in the rotation.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: Rosenthal has been unavailable the last three games. Lance Lynn, on the DL with a forearm strain, played catch Tuesday and remained on track to return in late June.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

HOUSTON --  All Luis Valbuena does is hit home runs. At least that's what it seems like to his teammates.	With his rookie pitcher needing an offensive boost Tuesday, Valbuena homered in consecutive innings -- including a three-run shot in a five-run third -- to help the Houston Astros beat the Colorado Rockies 8-5.	"This guy is like the kid who only hits homers," said catcher Hank Conger, who homered in the fifth inning.	Valbuena has 41 hits this season, including a team-leading 16 homers.	"Big boost for us especially when we get down early right there and for him to hit that pitch out right there," Conger said, "especially against a tough lefty today that was throwing pretty well through his first couple of innings, was really huge for us."	Valbuena hit a solo homer in the second off Chris Rusin (2-2) and added the three-run drive the next inning. His first homer landed in the Crawford Boxes in left field and showed his new patient approach at the plate.	"That's where I tried to hit it," the lefty-hitting third baseman said. "Right now I try to stay back and hit the ball that way. Everybody's aggressive if you throw a pitch in the strike zone everybody tries to hit it. Don't hit the pitch he wants you to hit, hit the pitch you want."	Will Harris (3-0) pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings in relief of rookie Vince Velasquez, who gave up five runs and seven hits in 4 2/3 innings. Luke Gregerson threw a perfect ninth for his 17th save in 19 chances.	Rusin (2-2) wasted a 3-1 lead and gave up seven runs and nine hits in four innings.	"Their averages aren't good but they live and die by the home run," Rusin said. "They hit a couple today. I wasn't able to keep the ball in the ballpark. Unfortunately we took the loss."	The win came on the day that reports of an FBI investigation on the St. Louis Cardinals' involvement with hacking Houston's email system surfaced.	Houston All-Star second baseman Jose Altuve went 1 for 4 with an RBI and a walk after missing three games because of a strained right hamstring. While he was back in the lineup manager A.J. Hinch was cautious about his ability to go full speed.	"I talked to him during the game and he assured me that he was just guarded more than anything else," the Astros' manager said. "I'll check with him, we'll get on the airplane, I'm not sure what I'm going to do the next day or two with him but he feels fine and was just making sure that there wasn't any mishap from what he told me."	Carlos Gonzalez hit a two-run homer for Colorado that chased Velasquez. He was also initially credited with a solo homer over the right-field foul pole in the seventh, but first-base umpire Bob Davidson's fair call was overturned in a video review.	Domingo Santana hit an RBI single to right in the third for his first major league hit. Santana, called up Monday, was 0 for 17 with 14 strikeouts last season.	UP NEXT	Rockies: Kyle Kendrick (2-8) faces the Astros on Wednesday, when the teams play in Denver.	Astros: Brett Oberholtzer (1-1) is to make his third start for Houston on Wednesday.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rockies: Rafael Betancourt, on the disabled list since June 8 with vertigo symptoms, pitched a bullpen session. Manager Walt Weiss said there is no timetable for his return.	Astros: Brad Peacock is scheduled to see another doctor regarding his right hip injury.	WAIVER WIRE	Third baseman Matt Dominguez was claimed off waivers from the Astros by the Milwaukee Brewers and assigned to Triple-A Colorado Springs.	A GIFT FOR MOM	Standing in front of his locker with a big smile, Santana knows where his first hit souvenir is going. As he showed off the ball he struck for his first major league hit he said it will land in the hands of his mother.	"I hope she keeps it safe," Santana said with a smile. "It's just really special, a dream come true."	ON SCHEDULE	With the two teams slated to fly to Denver on Tuesday night there was a watchful eye on tropical storm Bill which is currently working its way through Southeast Texas. Despite the specter of a deluge of rain both teams are on track to make their trip to the Rocky Mountain state.	TRIPLES GALORE	Rockies catcher Michael McKenry hit his third triple in five games. McKenry had gone his first 276 major league games without a triple.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN DIEGO --  Oakland's Eric Sogard took pleasure in helping ruin a big day for his former college coach, Padres interim manager Pat Murphy.	Sogard drove in the go-ahead in the ninth inning with a single off closer Craig Kimbrel, leading the A's to a 6-5 victory over San Diego on Tuesday and spoiling Murphy's major league debut.	"It's kind of neat for me to hand him his first loss," Sogard said with a broad smile. "A little bittersweet for him."	But Sogard, who played for Murphy at Arizona State, gave his former coach a lot of credit.	"I'm excited for Murph and his opportunity," Sogard said. "He helped me tremendously to get where I'm at today."	Murphy, named interim manager before the game, replaced Bud Black who was fired Monday. San Diego has lost both games since Black's firing, including Monday night's 9-1 loss to Oakland under acting manager Dave Roberts.	"A kid that I've known for a lot of years," Murphy said about Sogard. "That stings a little bit to be honest with you."	Kimbrel (1-2) issued a two-out walk to Billy Burns, who stole second and scored on Sogard's ground ball single to center.	"I thought our guys went out there and played great today and played with great energy and a great comeback in eight innings," Kimbrel said. "I just didn't go out and do my job."	The game was played on the one-year anniversary of the death of longtime Padre and Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn. The Padres played a brief video tribute to the eight-time NL batting champion before the game.	Burns not only scored the winning run but also had a two-run triple and robbed Justin Upton of a two-run homer in the first.	"He's had a knack for doing that recently," A's manager Bob Melvin said. "He just keeps getting better and better."	San Diego's Matt Kemp hit a solo homer in the eighth off Evan Scribner (2-1) to tie the game at 5-all. It was Kemp's third home run of the season.	Tyler Clippard pitched the ninth for his 10th save in 12 chances.	Ben Zobrist hit a two-run homer off Andrew Cashner to give the A's a 5-3 lead in the sixth inning.	Padres rookie Austin Hedges hit his first career home run, a solo shot in the third.	Cashner had not allowed a hit until a one-out double in the fifth by Max Muncy. After a two-out walk, Oakland starter Scott Kazmir singled sharply down the third-base line for one run. Burns followed with a two-run triple, tying the score at 3-all.	Kazmir went five innings, allowing three runs and five hits with eight strikeouts.	Kazmir cost his club a run in the fifth after Melvin Upton Jr. took off from third base with two outs when the left-hander started his windup. Kazmir stopped midway through his delivery to make a throw home and was called for a balk by home plate umpire Tripp Gibson.	Cashner gave up five runs and five hits in five innings-plus.	SIGN OF RESPECT FOR GWYNN	The Gwynn tribute video began to play while players from both teams were still stretching and running a few minutes before the game in the outfield. Both teams stopped what they were doing to watch the video.	TRAINER'S ROOM	A's: 1B Ike Davis (strained left calf) is expected to come off the 15-day DL on Wednesday. ... RHP Edward Mujica (fractured right thumb) is projected to make one more minor-league rehab appearance before being activated.	Padres: RHP Brandon Morrow (right shoulder inflammation) is still about a week away from picking up a baseball.	UP NEXT	A's: RHP Jessie Chavez (2-6, 2.64 ERA), who has the lowest run support (1.76) in the majors, starts against San Diego for the first time after six relief appearances.	Padres: RHP Odrisamer Despaigne (3-4, 4.38) makes his first career start against Oakland.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Things have been going so bad at home for the San Francisco Giants that they didn't even have a lead at any point in the first four games of the homestand.	After a pregame team meeting. Matt Duffy changed that with one swing.	Duffy helped wake up San Francisco's silent bats with a two-run homer in the second inning and added an RBI single in a three-run eighth that helped the Giants snap a nine-game home losing streak by beating the Seattle Mariners 6-2 on Tuesday.	"We had a little discussion about it today," Duffy said. "These fans are too good for us to be playing the way we have been at home. We've been playing really well on the road but for some reason or another it hasn't translated."	Casey McGehee added a two-run double and Angel Pagan hit an RBI single as the Giants snapped their longest home skid since an 11-gamer at New York's Polo Grounds in 1940. Tim Lincecum (7-3) allowed two runs and five hits in 5 2/3 innings to get the win in his second start against his hometown team.	"This is a game we needed just to kind of change momentum of how things have been going," McGehee said. "Definitely a better taste in our mouth getting on the plane this way rather than the alternative."	Brad Miller homered and drove in two runs for the Mariners, who split the two-game series in San Francisco and finished 4-4 on an eight-game road trip.	"It's perception versus reality," manager Lloyd McClendon said. "The perception is we're treading water and the reality is we're not playing as well as we should be playing. Today was a perfect example. We did not get the one hit to get us over the top."	The Giants avoided their first winless homestand of at least five games since the first one ever at AT&T Park in 2000. They did it by getting some rare offense at home.	San Francisco had scored just 17 runs during the home skid and had not homered in five straight games here before Duffy went deep in the second inning against J.A. Happ (3-3).	Lincecum, who has won five of six decisions at home, failed to make it out of the sixth inning. He allowed a solo homer in the fifth to Miller and then an RBI single to Miller in the sixth that cut the lead to 3-2.	George Kontos entered with two outs and runners on first and third and got Mike Zunino to fly out.	Pagan was ejected in the eighth inning after arguing with home plate umpire John Hirschbeck. The Giants still ended up with some insurance runs when Tom Wilhelmsen walked two batters before Duffy hit an RBI single and McGehee broke it open with a pinch-hit, two-run double.	RELIABLE RELIEF	Kontos, Javier Lopez, Sergio Romo and Santiago Casilla combined to retire all 10 batters they faced out of the Giants' bullpen. Kontos, who has appeared in 32 of 66 games, has been sharp all season and has not allowed any of the 16 runners he has inherited to score.	"He's really doing a nice job," manager Bruce Bochy said. "I've used him a lot. I get a little concerned about how much I've used him."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: LF Mark Trumbo did not start for a third straight game because of back spasms. He grounded out as a pinch-hitter in the seventh inning and could be back in the starting lineup by Wednesday.	Giants: OF Hunter Pence will wear a splint on his injured left wrist for the next five to seven days and will not swing a bat. ... OF Gregor Blanco was scheduled to run sprints and take part in baseball activity as he recovers from a concussion. He is expected to be able to play again in a day or two.	UP NEXT	Mariners: The four-game matchup shifts to Seattle for the final two games starting with a marquee pitching duel between Seattle's Felix Hernandez (9-3) and Madison Bumgarner (7-3). Hernandez allowed eight runs while retiring only one batter last Friday against Houston, matching the shortest start of his career.	Giants: Bumgarner makes his first appearance against an AL team since his five-inning save in Game 7 of the World Series last year against Kansas City that earned him Series MVP honors. Bumgarner allowed one run in eight innings of a no-decision in his only appearance against the Mariners.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

BOSTON -- Boston Red Sox fans seemed too excited about the end of a long losing streak to notice the significance of Brock Holt hitting a triple in the eighth inning.	Holt was a little surprised himself after the three-base hit meant he had hit for the cycle as the Red Sox slugged their way out of a seven-game losing streak with a 9-4 victory over the Atlanta Braves on Tuesday.	"It's a pretty special day. It's something I'll remember for a while," said Holt, Boston's first player to hit for the cycle in 19 years.	Holt's solo home run in the seventh gave Boston a 5-2 lead and left him a triple shy of completing the cycle. He wasn't really expecting to get another at-bat, let alone come through with a triple. But he knew he had a chance when he drove a fly ball into Fenway Park's famed triangle in center field.	"Once it gets in the triangle, anything's possible. I was just running," Holt said. "I tried to soak it all in. I looked in the dugout and my teammates were all pretty pumped at the top of the step."	Fenway fans didn't seem to catch on until the top of the ninth, when a message on the scoreboard announced Holt had completed the cycle.	"Any time a guy hits for the cycle he's had a stellar day," said manager John Farrell, who started Holt at second base while resting Dustin Pedroia.	It was the first cycle in the majors this season and the first for the Red Sox since John Valentin did it on June 6, 1996 against the White Sox in Boston.	Wade Miley (6-6) tied his season high with eight strikeouts in 6 1/3 solid innings and the Red Sox won for the first time since beating Oakland on June 7.	"He had great stuff. He was keeping everything down," Atlanta manager Fredi Gonzalez said.	Miley had plenty of offensive support from Holt and Alejandro De Aza. Holt had four of Boston's 18 hits and De Aza drove in three runs on two hits, including a two-run double in the sixth inning as the Red Sox rallied for three runs and broke 2-all tie.	"It's always great to get the run support like we did today," Miley said.	The Red Sox tagged Atlanta starter Julio Teheran (4-3) with six earned runs and 13 hits over 6 1/3 innings.	Juan Uribe had three hits for the Braves, who scored two runs off Koji Uehara in the ninth before Boston's closer settled down and ended the threat.	BETTER DAYS:	Miley made his first start since getting pulled early and arguing with Farrell in the dugout in a loss at Baltimore on Thursday.	"I kind of put all the stuff behind me from that last start," Miley said.	Still, Miley likely took a little heat off Boston's embattled manager by helping the Red Sox out of their longest losing streak of the season. Miley scattered five hits and allowed two runs and walked two before leaving with one out and a 5-2 lead in the seventh.	SLUGFEST:	Every Boston starter had at least one hit and six had two or more as the 18 hits were a season high. Mookie Betts finished with three hits, coming a home run short of hitting for the cycle.	The Red Sox were 6 for 14 with runners in scoring position.	"There's good hitters up and down our lineup," Farrell said. "We felt we were capable of putting up some runs."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Braves: SS Andrelton Simmons sat out after taking a pitch to the right hand while trying to bunt Monday night in the seventh inning of Atlanta's 4-2 win. Former Boston SS Pedro Ciriaco got the start.	Red Sox: Boston rested Pedroia (left knee) and LF Hanley Ramirez (back) with a short turnaround before a flight to Atlanta.	UP NEXT	Braves: LHP Alex Wood (4-4) starts as the interleague series moves to Atlanta for two games.	Red Sox: RHP Joe Kelly (2-4) faces the Braves for the third time in his career and first as a starter since he was pitching for the Cardinals in August 2013.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

BALTIMORE -- The Baltimore Orioles made history at the expense of the woeful Philadelphia Phillies, whose latest loss matched a club record for futility that had stood for 132 years.	Manny Machado and newcomer Chris Parmelee each hit two of an Orioles-record eight home runs, and Baltimore breezed past the Phillies 19-3 on Tuesday night for its eighth win in nine games.	"It's fun to watch, fun to be a part of," winning pitcher Chris Tillman said.	The defeat sealed the Phillies' first winless road trip of at least eight games since an 0-9 run in August 1883, their inaugural season. Philadelphia hosts the Orioles on Wednesday after going 0-8 in Cincinnati, Pittsburgh and Baltimore.	"Worst road trip I've ever been on as far as just the way we lost games," said right fielder Jeff Francoeur, who pitched the last two innings. "We were in a bunch of games and just lost them at the end, or one hit here or one pitch there."	Not this one.	The eight home runs are the most by the Orioles. They hit seven in a game three times previously, the last on Sept. 26, 2012, against Toronto.	"We squared up a lot of mistakes they made," Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said. "It just kind of snowballed."	Ryan Flaherty set the record with a solo shot in the eighth inning off Francoeur, who retired all three batters in the seventh after Baltimore scored in each of the first six innings.	In the eighth, though, he walked three, hit a batter and allowed two runs.	"I kind of got to experience everything that a pitcher probably experiences over a year in two innings," Francoeur said.	Machado set the tone by hitting starter Jerome Williams' second pitch into the seats in left field, sparking a six-run first inning that doomed the Phillies to their 12th consecutive road defeat.	Making his debut with the Orioles after being added to the 40-man roster earlier in the day, Parmelee set a career high with four hits and enjoyed his second career multihomer game. He scored three runs and had two RBIs.	"That's a pretty good way to start, right?" Parmelee said. "But you know, the team played phenomenal tonight."	Tillman (5-7) allowed three runs and four hits in six innings to win his third straight start.	Williams (3-7) left with a hamstring injury after getting only two outs. He was replaced by Dustin McGowan, who yielded five home runs in 3 1/3 innings: second-inning solo shots by Machado, Jimmy Paredes and Parmelee; a three-run drive by David Lough in the third; and a leadoff shot by Chris Davis in the fourth.	Parmelee added a leadoff homer off Justin De Fratus in the sixth. De Fratus' next pitch soared inside to J.J. Hardy, resulting in the right-hander's ejection by plate umpire Lance Barksdale.	"I know what it looked like. So once he pointed at me, you just walk off the mound," De Fratus said.	Maikel Franco homered for the Phillies, who were swept in a third straight series for the first time since 1989. Philadelphia owns the worst record in the majors (22-44) and worst road record (7-28).	Williams left the game after being flattened in a pileup at the plate when the two runs scored on a single wild pitch. The right-hander has surrendered 10 first-inning runs in his past two starts.	GOING DEEP	Phillies: Franco ranks second on the team with seven homers, and he's been playing in the majors only since May 15.	Orioles: Davis' HR was his sixth to hit Eutaw Street beyond the wall in right field, most in the history of Camden Yards.	TRAINERS ROOM	Phillies: RHP Chad Billingsley (shoulder) allowed one run in three innings for Triple-A Lehigh Valley on Tuesday in his first rehab appearance.	Orioles: Showalter rested CF Adam Jones, who had an MRI on his right shoulder that showed no structural damage. ... RHP Kevin Gausman (shoulder) gave up one run in two innings during a rehab start Tuesday with Class A Frederick. ... RHP Miguel Gonzalez (groin) will throw a bullpen session in Philadelphia on Thursday. If it goes well, he could pitch in a rehab game Saturday or Sunday, Showalter said.	ON DECK	Phillies: Veteran RHP Kevin Correia makes his second start for the Phillies on Wednesday night. He was signed as a free agent June 8.	Orioles: RHP Ubaldo Jimenez (4-3, 3.19 ERA) starts for Baltimore. He's 0-2 with an 11.25 ERA lifetime against Philadelphia.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PITTSBURGH -- To a man, the Pittsburgh Pirates starting rotation insists there is no sense of gamesmanship among them, no underlying need to try and outdo one another.	It just looks like it.	A week ago Charlie Morton ended a two-game skid by blanking the Milwaukee Brewers. When his spot in the rotation came up again Tuesday night against the Chicago White Sox, the spark Morton started has turned into a wave that shows no signs of slowing down.	If Morton felt any pressure, it didn't show. He worked seven efficient innings to remain unbeaten in his return from the disabled list as the Pirates rolled to a 3-0 victory. His sinker forcing the White Sox to pound the ball into the dirt, Morton (5-0) struck out three and walked just one to lower his ERA to 1.62.	On most teams, that number would be eye-popping. Not on Pittsburgh, where three starters have sub-2.00 ERAs.	"I just go out there and try to keep my team in the game," Morton said with a shrug.	That's hardly a problem at the moment for the streaking Pirates, who have won six straight, five by shutout, including the last three. It's the first time the Pirates have put up zeroes in three consecutive games since the final three games of the 1976 season against St. Louis.	"I haven't seen anything like this in all my years managing, a run like this of starting pitching," manager Clint Hurdle said.	Pittsburgh's starters have surrendered one earned run in the last 43 1/3 innings, including 14 1/3 scoreless innings by Morton.	"Nobody is going to get cut if they don't throw a shutout," Hurdle said with a smile. "They're just going out there trying to keep this thing moving."	Francisco Cervelli and Sean Rodriguez hit solo home runs for the Pirates. Starling Marte, who had two hits, is batting .600 (15 for 25) over his last five games. Mark Melancon worked a perfect ninth for his 21st save.	Jose Quintana (3-7) gave up three runs in six innings and again received little support in his 100th career start. The White Sox have dropped five straight.	"We've got to be able to swing the bats better," Chicago manager Robin Ventura said. "You tip your hat somewhat but some of it's just a funk we're in that we have to be able to find a way out of it."	The White Sox managed all of two hits while getting blanked by Francisco Liriano on Monday night. They weren't any more effective 24 hours later against Morton, who is enjoying the best stretch of his uneven career following a lengthy layoff from hip surgery and some extra time in the minors refining his mechanics.	Morton's new delivery isn't second nature yet, and he admits he spends the first couple of innings trying to refine his motion before settling in.	Chicago's best chance came in the first inning, when Adam Eaton led off with a walk and stole second. Eaton slid past third base on a fielder's choice and was tagged out by Jung Ho Kang. Three batters later Morton was out of the inning and cruising. He retired 11 straight at one point, giving Pittsburgh's offense enough time to solve Quintana.	Quintana's rough start had smoothed out recently. He came in having won his last two starts after being given four runs to work with, a stark contrast to April and May when the White Sox scored one run or less six times when Quintana's spot in the rotation came up.	The Pirates moved in front in the third when Andrew McCutchen drove home Marte with a sharp single to left. Rodriguez added a homer deep into the bleachers in left field with one out in the fourth and Cervelli continued his torrid hitting with a rare show of power, taking a Quintana offering 412 feet for his second home run of the season.	Cervelli is hitting .356 since May 1. Just as importantly, opponents haven't scored a run with Cervelli behind the plate for 51 innings and counting.	"He's just playing some backyard ball," Hurdle said. "It's fun to watch him."	SIGNING SPREE	The Pirates signed supplemental first-round draft pick Ke'Bryan Hayes and second-round pick Kevin Kramer on Tuesday.	Hayes, the son of former major league infielder Charlie Hayes, hit .436 with 27 RBI for Concordia Lutheran (Texas) High this spring. The 18-year-old will begin his career with the Gulf Coast League Pirates. Kramer, taken with the 62nd overall pick, hit .323 for ULCA in 2015 and led the Bruins with seven homers while starting 61 games at shortstop.	UP NEXT	The series shifts to Chicago for two games at U.S. Cellular Field. Jeff Locke (3-3, 4.90) starts for the Pirates. Locke pitched six scoreless innings while earning a no-decision against Philadelphia in his last start. The 27-year-old is 4-1 with a 2.82 ERA in seven interleague starts. John Danks (3-6, 5.16 ERA) will try to end a two-game losing streak. The left-hander is 10-7 with 3.01 ERA against the National League in his nine-year career.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

DETROIT --  The Cincinnati Reds still aren't clicking on all cylinders an offense, but their latest win was a step in the right direction.	Todd Frazier and Jay Bruce ended an 18-inning scoreless streak with back-to-back homers in the fifth inning and Frazier homered again in the seventh to help the Reds beat the Detroit Tigers 5-2 on Tuesday night.	Frazier's second homer was impressive, landing 425 feet away in the Reds' center-field bullpen.	"I just squared them up," Frazier said. "Not to be cocky about it, but I know I can hit a ball out of any park."	The Reds had totaled only four runs in a three-game losing streak, and didn't get on the board until the fifth against Detroit, but Michael Lorenzen and the Reds' bullpen made the homers stand up.	Lorenzen (2-2) allowed two runs -- one earned -- and six hits with three walks in six innings, only striking out one.	"He had some notable hitters in that lineup, but he made the pitches he had to make," Reds manager Bryan Price said. "I thought he used his curveball very well and managed his fastball around the zone."	Three relievers finished, with Aroldis Chapman striking out the side in the ninth -- getting James McCann to end it on a 103-mph fastball -- for his 14th save.	"There aren't a lot of guys out there who can throw 103," said McCann. "You really don't get much chance to practice hitting it."	Kyle Ryan (1-1) took his first major-league loss, giving up four runs in 6 1/3 innings. Ryan only surrendered five hits, but three were homers.	The Tigers took a 1-0 lead in the first. Anthony Gose led off with a bloop double to left, took third on Ian Kinsler's long fly to right-center and scored when Miguel Cabrera singled through the hole vacated by Cincinnati's shifted second baseman, Brandon Phillips.	For the second day in a row, the Reds didn't have any early offensive success. After being shut out by Anibal Sanchez on Monday, Cincinnati only managed one hit in the first four innings against Ryan.	Frazier and Jay Bruce, though, led off the fifth with back-to-back homers.	Detroit immediately tied the score on a strange play in the bottom of the inning. The Tigers had loaded the bases with two out on a single, an error by left fielder Ivan De Jesus Jr. and an intentional walk to Cabrera. Yoenis Cespedes hit a hard grounder off Lorenzen's leg, allowing James McCann to score, but Joey Votto scooped up the loose ball and threw Gose out at the plate.	The Tigers challenged the call, but it stood after a delay of 3:38, a decision that frustrated Ausmus.	"I definitely think that instant replay has regressed this season," he said. "I thought for the most part, they changed calls in order to get the play right, and they did that on a regular basis.	"I'm not seeing that this year."	An MLB spokesman said that the replay official wasn't able to tell if Brayan Pena's tag was on time or not.	"After viewing all relevant angles, the replay official felt that he could not definitively determine that the runner touched home prior to being tagged," Mike Teevan said in an email to the Associated Press.	Frazier led off the seventh with a homer, this time a 425-foot shot that landed in the Cincinnati bullpen in center. Billy Hamilton made it 4-2 later in the inning with a bloop single that scored Bruce.	"Billy coming up and getting that two-out hit -- that's big for us," Price said. "For whatever reason, when he gets up there with runners in scoring position, he gets them in."	Cincinnati added a run in the ninth on a throwing error by Jose Iglesias.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: RHP Jon Moscot went on the 15-day disabled list with a dislocated left shoulder while the team optioned OF Brennan Boesch to Triple-A Louisville. To reinforce a bullpen depleted by Moscot's seven-pitch start Monday, they brought up two pitchers from Louisville -- righties Donovan Hand and Carlos Contreras.	Tigers: DH Victor Martinez (knee) went 1 for 4 with an RBI double for Triple-A Toledo, and is now hitting .333 in three games of a rehab stint. Martinez, who underwent surgery for a torn meniscus this spring, was hitting .216 with minimal power when he went on the disabled list May 19.	UP NEXT	The teams move to Cincinnati for the second half of their home-and-home series, with aces David Price (6-2, 2.44) for Detroit and Johnny Cueto (4-4, 2.85) for the Reds. Cueto, an oft-mentioned trade target for the Tigers, will be facing Detroit for the first time, while Price is 1-0 with a 1.69 ERA in two career starts against Cincinnati.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

NEW YORK --  A pair of pitchers back from Tommy John surgery gave this New York Mets win a 2013 feel.	Matt Harvey returned to form with seven shutout innings and an RBI double, Bobby Parnell earned a five-out save and the Mets beat the Toronto Blue Jays 3-2 Tuesday night.	"Definitely fun when you match up obviously what we've been through," Harvey said.	One night after ending Toronto's 11-game winning streak, the NL East leaders held on without their top late relievers thanks in part to a major baserunning blunder by the Blue Jays. New York won for the fifth time in six games and improved to 11-0 at home against Toronto.	Wilmer Flores and Ruben Tejada each knocked in a run and scored another to help the Mets build a 3-0 cushion. Harvey (7-4), who was 1/3 with a 7.20 ERA in his previous four starts, allowed four hits against the best offense in baseball and gave a fired-up fist pump after tossing a perfect seventh.	"I saw outstanding stuff," Terry Collins said after his 340th victory as Mets manager broke a tie with Gil Hodges for third on the franchise list behind Davey Johnson (595) and Bobby Valentine (536). "Matt was bound and determined to have a good game."	The ace right-hander struck out six, walked none and was lifted after 107 pitches.	"Kind of had my slider back, which was nice. That helped with commanding my pitches. For me, it was just being able to locate," Harvey said.	With the Mets resting heavily used closer Jeurys Familia and hard-throwing rookie Hansel Robles, Carlos Torres entered to start the eighth. He issued a leadoff walk and gave up a single to Kevin Pillar before former Mets star Jose Reyes singled to right field for his first hit in nine at-bats during his return to Citi Field this week.	Ryan Goins was held at third base -- but Pillar didn't realize it. He went tearing around second and, with third already occupied, was a sitting duck to be tagged out after Curtis Granderson's throw was cut off.	"I made a mistake by not picking up the third base coach," Pillar said. "It's as embarrassing as it gets."	Torres walked Josh Donaldson to load the bases before Parnell gave up a sacrifice fly to Jose Bautista and a run-scoring single to Edwin Encarnacion. But the right-hander, who saved 22 games in 2013 before missing the final two months of the season with a herniated disk in his neck, struck out Chris Colabello on a ball in the dirt.	"Sometimes to swim you've got to jump in the deep end, right?" Parnell said.	In his third outing of the year, Parnell then worked a 1-2-3 ninth for his first save since July 30, 2013. He blew a save opportunity on opening day last season, then missed the rest of the year recovering from his reconstructive elbow operation.	"Felt good. Definitely had some adrenaline going," he said. "That ninth inning is always good."	After getting the final out, the bearded Parnell breathed a sigh of relief and flashed a smile on the mound.	"That was a big milestone," he said. "Finally had some weight off my shoulders."	Flores hit a leadoff double in the second against Scott Copeland (1-1) and scored on Tejada's single. With two outs, Harvey lashed a ringing double to left-center to make it 2-0.	It was his fifth career double and sixth RBI -- the first of each since 2013. Mets pitchers have 22 hits this season, most of any staff in the majors.	"I'm more concentrating on pitching right now," Harvey said.	Flores added a sacrifice fly in the third.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: Copeland again pitched in place of RHP Aaron Sanchez, put on the 15-day disabled list Monday with a mild lat muscle strain. Sanchez is likely to miss his next turn on Sunday as well, manager John Gibbons said. ... Rookie 2B Devon Travis (left shoulder) is 0 for 7 with a sacrifice fly in the first two games of his rehab assignment with Double-A New Hampshire. Toronto hopes to get Travis back within a week or so.	Mets: LF Michael Cuddyer was rested in favor of rookie Darrell Ceciliani, who had two hits. Ceciliani will stay in the lineup the next two nights in Toronto, Collins said, because he plans to use Cuddyer and maybe Granderson at DH to give their thirty-something legs a break on the turf at Rogers Centre.	UMPIRE OUT	Sean Barber filled in for Marty Foster on the umpiring crew and was stationed at first base. Foster was behind the plate Monday night but left the game after getting hit square in the facemask by a foul ball. He was being evaluated for concussion-like symptoms and had not been cleared to return. Major League Baseball said the substitution might last more than one game.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays: RHP Drew Hutchison (5-1, 5.75 ERA) pitches Wednesday night at home against the Mets.	Mets: LHP Jonathon Niese (3-6, 4.24) is 0-4 with a 6.82 ERA in his past six starts, though he's pitched pretty well the last two times out. Niese has permitted 11 unearned runs, second-most in the majors behind Padres RHP Andrew Cashner (13). In his only previous start against the Blue Jays, Niese gave up eight runs, eight hits and a career-high four homers over three innings in a 14-5 loss at Toronto in May 2012.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MIAMI --  Nathan Eovaldi pitched so poorly he got booed on the road.	Pouncing on their former teammate, the Miami Marlins scored a franchise record eight first-inning runs Tuesday and beat the New York Yankees 12-2 to complete a two-game sweep.	Disgruntled Yankees fans were plentiful at Marlins Park, and Eovaldi heard a chorus of jeers as he trudged to the dugout, gone from the game before the first inning ended.	"I was just keeping a whole lot of balls up in the zone," Eovaldi said. "I was looking forward to this start, and I felt good getting ready today. It's very frustrating."	Giancarlo Stanton hit a three-run homer in the fifth, his 24th, which leads the majors.	"You've got to keep throwing punches," Stanton said.	The Marlins totaled nine hits in the first, including seven in a row after leadoff batter Dee Gordon grounded out. Marcell Ozuna hit a 99-mph fastball for a bases-loaded single to drive in the first two runs, and Adeiny Hechavarria hit a two-run triple. Derek Dietrich had the first and last hits in the inning, including an RBI triple that ended Eovaldi's night.	"They hit some balls hard," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "He was finding the middle, and his split was up, and that's bad combination."	Eovaldi (5-2) was charged with all eight runs in two-thirds of an inning, the shortest start of his career. His ERA rose from 4.13 to 5.12, and he fell to 6-15 at Marlins Park.	The Marlins' batting average against Eovaldi in the inning was .818.	"That was great," Stanton said. "I don't think I've done that -- eight runs in the first."	He hadn't. The Marlins' previous record for runs in a first inning was seven, done five times.	Alex Rodriguez, back in his hometown for two nights, did not play and remained five hits shy of 3,000.	Stanton's opposite-field homer off the upper-deck facade came against Chris Martin to make the score 11-0.	"The game was out of hand already, but it put the icing on the cake," Stanton said. He has nine homers and 18 RBI this month.	Dee Gordon, who leads the majors in hits, went 3 for 5 and scored twice. The Marlins totaled 16 hits.	"A great offensive approach throughout the game," manager Dan Jennings said. "It's a lot of fun when you're able to put together something like that."	David Phelps (4-3) allowed two runs in seven innings. He and Eovaldi swapped teams when they were part of a five-player trade in December.	Miami's run total was a season high. New York gave up a double-figure total for the third time in the past 11 games.	The Marlins went 5-1 on their homestand, outscoring opponents 30-9. The Yankees went 1-4 on their trip and were outscored 37-15.	"We have not pitched well. We haven't swung the bats," Girardi said. "Hopefully going home will be good medicine for us."	The Yankees were playing in Miami for the first time since 2009. The teams now go to New York for a two-game series beginning Wednesday.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: Tropical Storm Bill forced a change in RHP Jose Fernandez's rehabilitation schedule. Anticipating that Triple-A New Orleans' game Wednesday at Red Rock will be rained out, Fernandez (elbow) will instead stay in Florida and pitch Wednesday for Single-A Jupiter at Brevard. ... RHP Henderson Alvarez (shoulder) probably won't return until after the All-Star break, Jennings said. ... 1B Michael Morse (finger) is scheduled to begin a rehab assignment Wednesday with Double-A Jacksonville.	Yankees: OF Jacob Ellsbury (right knee) is still not 100 percent and not ready for rehab games, and is unlikely to rejoin the team this month, Girardi said.	UP NEXT	Stanton will likely be the DH Wednesday in New York.	"It will be my first time in Yankee Stadium, so that'll be cool -- just the tradition they have there, the whole aura, the whole New York atmosphere," Stanton said. "I'm sure I'll be yelled and screamed at. It'll be fun."	Stanton's favorite Yankee slugger ever?	"Got to go with Babe Ruth," he said. "First one to drop the long ball, man."	Yanks RHP Michael Pineda (7-3, 3.74) is scheduled to start against RHP Jose Urena (1-2, 4.44).	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Wilson Ramos had a most unique multihomer game.	Ramos homered twice off position players, Bryce Harper and Clint Robinson also went deep, and the Washington Nationals routed the Tampa Bay Rays 16-4 on Tuesday night.	"We had a lot fun as a team," Harper said.	With the game out of reach, Rays manager Kevin Cash used infielders Jake Elmore and Nick Franklin to pitch the final two innings. Ramos hit a solo shot against Elmore in the eighth and added a two-run drive off Franklin in the ninth to finish with four RBI.	"The last two at-bats, I was very, very relaxed at the plate," he said. "I just used my hands to hit the ball. I was waiting for a good pitch and that's the position I need to be with the regular pitcher. I need to see those videos because those two at-bats will help me. That made me feel good."	When asked if Elmore or Franklin was more effective, Cash said "You'd have to ask Wilson Ramos."	Harper hit his 22nd homer this season and finished a triple shy of the cycle with a walk. His long solo shot to center off C.J. Riefenhauser during a four-run fifth that gave Washington a 10-0 lead. The ball landed on protective netting near a fish tank that is home to a group of cownose rays.	Robinson had a leadoff homer among his four hits and added an RBI double off Alex Colome during a six-run second inning that put the Nationals up 6-0.	Danny Espinosa had a career-high five hits and was hit by a pitch from Franklin, but he was the only Washington starter not to have an RBI.	Tanner Roark (3-2) allowed one run and six hits over seven innings.	Yunel Escobar drove in three runs, one of eight Washington starters driving in at least one run.	The Nationals' 23 hits were the most since relocating to Washington in 2005, and the most in franchise history since the Montreal Expos had 26 on May 7, 1997, at San Francisco.	"Everybody contributed," Washington manager Matt Williams said.	Colome (3-3) gave up six runs, seven hits and three walks over two innings as Tampa Bay lost for just the fifth time in 17 games.	Rene Rivera hit a three-run homer in the ninth for the Rays.	ampa Bay third baseman Evan Longoria had two hits one day after leaving with a bruised left wrist, the result of being hit by a pitch Monday in the fifth inning.	Franklin pinch-hit for Longoria in the fifth with the Rays down 10-1. Joey Butler had a run-scoring grounder earlier in the inning.	Cash said Longoria is fine and that he was removed due to the one-sided score.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: Williams said "we're looking at Thursday, barring some kind of issue" for RHP Doug Fister (right forearm tightness) to rejoin the rotation. ... RHP Stephen Strasburg (neck stiffness) is scheduled to start Wednesday for Double-A Harrisburg in what could be his lone minor league appearance.	Rays: LHP Matt Moore (elbow surgery) made his third rehab start for Class A Charlotte and may be back late this month. ... Reliever Enny Romero left in the seventh with lower back tightness.	MOVING DAY	Riefenhauser was optioned to Triple-A Durham. RHP Ronald Belisario had his contract purchased from the International League club.	PINCH-HITTING PITCHER	RHP Joe Ross popped out in the ninth as a pinch-hitter for DH Escobar.	DOUBLE DUTY	It was first time two position players pitched for a team in a nine-inning game since July 20, 1990, when Montreal used Junior Noboa and Dave Martinez at Houston.	UP NEXT	Nationals RHP Jordan Zimmermann (2-2) and Rays RHP Matt Andriese (1-1) are Wednesday night's starters when the home-and-home series shifts to Washington D.C.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Texas Rangers catcher Robinson Chirinos had to quickly forget about the pitch he called in the top of the ninth inning.	All that really mattered for the Rangers was the one Chirinos hit over the wall.	Chirinos homered leading off the bottom of the ninth for a 3-2 victory over the NL West-leading Los Angeles Dodgers, who got Josh Turner's tying two-run homer to deny rookie Chi Chi Gonzalez a shutout and a complete game.	"I'm just happy to come through in that situation," Chirinos said. "I've been calling eight shutout innings and one pitch tied the game so I was mad at myself. I said `Just forget it. Go out there and try to get on base and try to win this game.' That's what I did."	Chirinos' sixth homer of the season, an estimated 401 feet to left-center, came off Josh Ravin (2-1), who had just taken over after Brett Anderson's eight solid innings.	"It was a 1-1 count, and if you go back and look, it was probably right over the plate," Ravin said. "These are big-league hitters, and it doesn't matter how hard you throw, they're going to hit it."	Shawn Tolleson (2-1), who had been proclaimed the Texas closer earlier in the day by manager Jeff Banister, gave up a pair of two-out singles after taking over before Jimmy Rollins' inning-ending flyout.	Texas won both home games against the Dodgers, though the teams play again Wednesday and Thursday in Los Angeles.	"Very mature outing, was on the attack all night long. 105 pitches, one bad pitch," Banister said. "Some really good hitters taking some not-so-good swings."	Gonzalez, the 23-year-old right-hander, gave up a one-out walk in the ninth to Howie Kendrick before a visit to the mound by pitching coach Mike Maddux. But Turner homered on the next pitch, an inside fastball.	"I was questioning myself that maybe I should have went away, I should have went changeup," Chirinos said.	"We were pounding everybody in the whole game, just waiting for who was going to make the adjustment. He happened to make it," Gonzalez said. "And sure enough I give up the home run but (Chirinos) gets it back for me."	Gonzalez has allowed only three runs over 30 innings, giving him a 0.90 ERA so far in his big-league career. He struck out two and walked two while allowing five hits.	Anderson scattered eight hits and allowed two runs over eight innings. The lefty struck out four and walked three while throwing 114 pitches.	Prince Fielder scored a run, on a play after stumbling around third base and face-planting into the ground, and later drove in a run one with an infield single for the Rangers.	RANGERS TIDBITS	Texas has won nine of its last 11 home games, and is 27-14 overall since May 4 -- the best record and most wins in the majors during that span. The Ranger (35-30) are five games over .500 for the first time this season. ... Mitch Moreland has an 11-game hitting streak, matching his career high set last month. ...	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: OF Scott Van Slyke is ready to come off the DL after missing 18 games because of back inflammation. . "He's done his rehab now," manager Don Mattingly said. "As long as he doesn't trip and break an ankle between now and (Wednesday), I think he'll be activated." ... LHP Paco Rodriguez and RHP Pedro Baez and Brandon League each pitched a scoreless inning for Class A Rancho Cucamonga on Monday night. League, the only of that trio who has been out all season, was set to pitch again Tuesday night.	Rangers: LF Josh Hamilton (strained left hamstring) said he won't be traveling for upcoming games in Los Angeles and Chicago. ... OF Delino DeShields (strained left hamstring) believes he might have been "a little dehydrated" when he got hurt lunging for a ball Sunday.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: Three-time NL Cy Young winner and Dallas native Clayton Kershaw (5-3) pitches against his hometown team after watching the two games in Texas the ballpark where he grew up regularly going to games.	Rangers: For the first time since 2001, the Rangers play a game at Dodger Stadium, ending their longest gap between visits to a current stadium. They last went to Cincinnati and Pittsburgh in 2007.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CHICAGO --  Carlos Santana found his power stroke in his return to the cleanup spot for the Cleveland Indians.	Santana hit a three-run homer and an RBI double, Trevor Bauer pitched seven innings of four-hit ball, and the Indians beat the Chicago Cubs 6-0 on Tuesday night.	Santana also walked twice after he was just 3 for 28 with a home run and an RBI in his previous seven games. Touted prospect Francisco Lindor replaced Santana in the No. 2 slot and contributed two hits in his first career start.	"I know it's a long season, but regardless of where they would have been hitting, when they swing the bat like that, we're going to be just fine," manager Terry Francona said.	Santana has made 30 starts in the No. 2 hole and 25 in the No. 4 slot.	"When I'm second, I don't say nothing because, you know, I like to play," Santana said. "But I feel much better (in the cleanup spot)."	The Cubs welcomed the Blackhawks and the Stanley Cup to Wrigley Field one night after Chicago beat Tampa Bay 2-0 in Game 6 for its third NHL title in the past six seasons. Cubs manager Joe Maddon hoisted the silver trophy over his head in front of the home dugout, and the teams posed for a picture on the pitcher's mound.	"It's kind of an honor that they would present it for me to be able to do that," said Maddon, who got the Cup from Blackhawks forward Patrick Sharp.	The opener of the abbreviated two-game series was rained out in time for Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo to catch the clinching game at the United Center. Indians second baseman Jason Kipnis, who is from the Chicago suburb of Northbrook, celebrated with fellow Blackhawks fans on a packed street in Wrigleyville.	Cubs right-hander Jake Arrieta (6-5) walked six in five innings, and two of them scored on Santana's drive that just cleared the wall in right in the third. Rizzo went 0 for 3 with a walk, extending his slump to 1 for 21 over the last six games.	"Frustrated with myself for the inability to overcome some of the walks and make some pitches," Arrieta said.	Bauer (6-3) struck out seven and walked three, bouncing back quite nicely from a rough start in a 9-3 loss to Seattle last Wednesday. The right-hander is 4-2 with a 2.51 ERA in his last seven games.	"It looked like he got stronger as he went," Francona said. "Pretty impressive."	Zach McAllister pitched the eighth and Marc Rzepczynski finished the four-hitter for Cleveland's fourth shutout of the year.	Bauer also got his first career hit with a leadoff single in the fifth. He was promptly erased by a fielder's choice, but Kipnis stole second and scored when Lindor singled for his first RBI in the majors. Kipnis scored for the third time on Michael Brantley's double in the seventh.	"I threw the barrel in the middle of the zone, closed my eyes and I hit it and I was like `Oh wait, I hit it, wait, where is it? Oh, I gotta run," Bauer said of his clean single to center. "I didn't think I'd ever get a career hit."	Kyle Schwarber, another hyped prospect from Chicago's rich minor league system, was promoted from Double-A Tennessee before the game, and made his major league debut after catcher Miguel Montero was ejected before the bottom of the eighth. Schwarber struck out looking in his first at-bat in the ninth.	NOT SO HAPPY	Indians center fielder Michael Bourn looked at a called third strike in the fourth, and then was ejected by plate umpire Phil Cuzzi before the bottom half of the inning. Bourn struck out in each of his two at-bats and is hitting .212 (7 for 33) in June.	Bourn's argument with Cuzzi came at an inopportune time for Francona.	"I was trying to go to the bathroom," Francona said. "Can't even do that in peace. I heard the guys yelling and started trying to get myself in order. All I did was really kind of pee on myself. Too late to help Bourney anyway."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: LHP Zac Rosscup was visited by pitching coach Chris Bosio, and then Maddon and a trainer in the ninth. He tried a few warmup pitches, and then was promptly replaced by Justin Grimm. "A little bit stiff in the shoulder," Maddon said. "I'm waiting to hear exactly what's going on."	UP NEXT	Indians RHP Danny Salazar (6-2, 3.54 ERA) and Cubs RHP Jason Hammel (5-2, 2.81 ERA) face off in Cleveland on Wednesday. Salazar pitched seven innings of three-run ball in a 4-0 loss at Detroit on Friday in his previous outing. Hammel is 2-0 with a 2.29 ERA in three June starts.	---	Jay Cohen can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/jcohenap	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

MILWAUKEE --  Chris Young jokingly questioned the strategy of Ned Yost replacing him with a pinch hitter. Who could blame the pitcher?	Young became the first Royals pitcher to drive in three runs in a game since 1972 and worked seven innings of five-hit ball Tuesday night, leading Kansas City to a 7-2 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers.	"He said, `you know, I don't see anybody else on this team with two hits and three RBI," Yost said. "And I said, `well, you've got a point there."	The only other time Young had a multi-RBI game was when he drove in two runs on May 24, 2009, and he hadn't had a hit since Sept. 23, 2012. But Yost replaced Young with pinch-hitter Jarrod Dyson in the eighth inning.	Dyson delivered a run-scoring triple to give his team a 7-0 lead.	"Dyson came in and made Ned look good," Young said. "I had no power in my bat."	Young had a two-run single in the fourth inning and an RBI single in the fifth for the Royals, who have won six of eight after a 2-9 skid. He is the sixth Kansas City pitcher with at least three RBI and the first since Steve Busby.	Young (6-2) struck out three without any walks to improve to 12-2 in interleague starts in his career.	Lorenzo Cain and Mike Moustakas each homered for Kansas City.	Matt Garza (4-8) allowed six runs and a career-high 13 hits in 6 2/3 innings. He is 1-5 at home this year.	Milwaukee is 11-24 at Miller Park after losing its fourth game in a row.	"They hit the ball all over the place," Garza said. "It's frustrating, but what are you going to do?"	Cain hit a two-run shot to left field in the first for his second long ball in two nights.	Young, who entered with 14 RBI in his career, put Kansas City up 4-0 with his two-run hit.	"I spent a few years in the National League and I feel I can handle the bat OK," Young said. "But any base hit is a bonus."	Moustakas homered for the first time since May 27, a solo shot in the seventh.	GOOD COMPANY	Kansas City hosts Milwaukee on Wednesday and Yost needs one more victory to tie Whitey Herzog for most wins in franchise history. Herzog collected 410 victories from 1975-79.	BE CAREFUL	With runners at first and third and two outs in the third inning, Cain saved at least one run when he robbed Jonathan Lucroy of a hit with a leaping catch into the center field wall. Cain's back hit the wall hard and he could be seen grimacing as he jogged to the dugout.	UECKER MISSES GAME	Milwaukee radio broadcaster Bob Uecker missed the game after sustaining a mild concussion Monday when he was hit by a ball during batting practice. The 81-year-old spent the night in a hospital for precautionary reasons after calling most of the game Monday.	ROSTER MOVE	The Brewers claimed third baseman Matt Dominguez off waivers from Houston and was optioned to Triple-A Colorado Springs.	UP NEXT	Royals: Joe Blanton (0-0) makes his first start since July 22, 2013, filling in for Jason Vargas, who is on the 15-day disabled list.	Brewers: Mike Fiers (3-6) has posted a 2.97 ERA over his last seven starts.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals: Vargas played catch before the game to test his injured left elbow. The pitcher was placed on the DL on Saturday. He can return June 24 and Yost thinks he will not need a rehabilitation start.	Brewers: Carlos Gomez did not play for the fifth time in the last six games because of a sore groin/hip.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Angels manager Mike Scioscia rearranged his batting order, and the results weren't exactly overwhelming -- except for a game-changing home run by the new cleanup hitter.	Albert Pujols drove in the tying and go-ahead runs in the sixth inning against Jeremy Hellickson with his 539th career homer, David Freese also hit a two-run shot and Garrett Richards pitched seven innings of four-hit ball to help Los Angeles beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 4-1 on Tuesday night.	Scioscia wanted a different look offensively after watching his team total just five runs over the previous three games. Mike Trout and Pujols were moved back to third and fourth, respectively, while Kole Calhoun replaced Trout in the second spot after batting cleanup in 24 of the previous 27 games and hitting .235 with three homers and 14 RBI during that stretch.	"You don't change your approach because of where you're hitting in the lineup," said Pujols, who started in the cleanup spot for the 240th time in his career and first time since May 21, 2010, with the St. Louis Cardinals.	"It doesn't matter if you hit eighth, leadoff ... you've still got to go out there and play. I wish you guys flip that page and stay focused on the things we have to concentrate on, and that's winning -- not about where I hit, or Trout hitting third. I mean, if that's your wish, you got it tonight."	Pujols was 1 for 3, while Trout went 1 for 3 and Calhoun 0 for 4.	"The lineup wasn't a factor tonight, because we didn't get much going," Scioscia said. "I don't think we had a leadoff runner on for most of the night and that's a tough way to go. So we'll continue to try to try to move forward and find solutions and see if we can apply more pressure on teams."	The Angels managed only three hits through the first five innings -- two-out singles by Trout, Carlos Perez and Kyle Kubitza in the first, second and fifth. But Hellickson (4-4) walked Trout with two out in the sixth after getting ahead of him 1-2, and Pujols drove a 2-1 pitch to left-center for his 19th homer of the season and 11th in 18 games.	"It's really tough, but we stuck to our game plan all night," Arizona catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia said. "The plan was not to let guys on base in front of those two guys so that they could do a lot of damage. Trout's a great hitter and he had a great at-bat there. You never want two-out walks, but I'm not upset with a two-out walk to a guy like Trout."	Hellickson allowed two runs and four hits in six innings, striking out six and walking one for Arizona. The right-hander, who came in with a 5.29 ERA, hasn't pitched seven full innings in any of last 22 starts since Aug. 6, 2014.	"It's very frustrating, to say the least," said Hellickson, who retired the first two batters in every inning he pitched. "The way Richards was throwing, I've got to keep the ball in the yard right there. I'm just really mad at myself right now.	"I wanted to throw a fastball down and away to Pujols, but I just left it up a little too much," Hellickson added.	Richards (7-4) yielded an unearned run and three walks, struck out four and retired his final 11 batters after a shaky start as the Angels snapped Arizona's four-game winning streak.	The right-hander, coming off a 6-2 road victory against Tampa Bay in which he allowed two runs over seven innings, has won back-to-back starts for the first time since April 24-30 against Texas and Oakland.	Freese capped the scoring in the eighth against Randall Delgado with his 10th homer after a two-out walk to Pujols. Huston Street pitched a perfect ninth for his 20th save in 22 attempts.	Thanks in part to a fielding error by rookie Taylor Featherston in his fourth start at second base in the big leagues, Richards found himself in a bases-loaded, one-out jam in the first after just nine pitches. He got a visit from pitching coach Mike Butcher before striking out Yasmany Tomas and retiring Jake Lamb on a grounder.	Butcher went to the mound again in the second after Chris Owings led off with a single and advanced to third on a pair of passed balls by Perez with one out and Nick Ahmed at the plate -- the second one coming on ball four to the D-backs' No. 9 hitter. A.J. Pollock drove in Owings with a sacrifice fly.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: RHP Chase Anderson (2-1) will make his 13th start of the season as the scene shifts to Phoenix for the final two games of this four-game showdown. He is 2-0 with a 2.16 ERA in eight starts since losing 5-4 to Colorado on April 27 at Chase Field. Last Friday at San Francisco, Anderson pitched seven innings of one-hit ball in a 1-0 victory.	Angels: LHP Hector Santiago (4-3) is coming off his third straight no-decision since beating Detroit 2-0 with 7 1/3 innings of three-hit ball at home.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

WASHINGTON --  Tampa Bay Rays right fielder Steven Souza Jr. strode to the plate in the second inning to a loud ovation from the Nationals Park crowd.	Then came a few scattered boos after a single. And silence after his home run.	Souza belted his 13th homer of the season and had three hits to help the Rays to a 5-0 victory over the Washington Nationals in his return to his old home park.	"The way the fans responded, that was pretty emotional, pretty high moment for me," said Souza of the ovation.	Curt Casali had his first career home run and a three-hit game on a night the AL East-leading Rays pitched a two-hit shutout without using a conventional starter.	Matt Andriese (2-1) pitched four shutout innings of relief. Reliever-turned-starter Steve Geltz went six up, six down in what manager Kevin Cash called a bullpen game.	Jordan Zimmermann (5-5) took the loss, allowing three runs in seven innings.	"I thought it was good," Zimmermann said of his outing. "A couple of solo home runs. I can live with that."	The Nationals committed three errors and had just two hits, one night after belting out 23 in a 16-4 victory over the Rays in Tampa.	"Just a blip," Cash said of his team's pitching Tuesday. "And then they move on and just go pitch a tremendous ballgame. "	Souza made his major league debut with Washington last season and played in 21 games. On the final day of the season, he made a diving catch in left field to preserve Zimmermann's no-hitter against the Miami Marlins, one of the Nationals' most iconic moments.	"I know that Jordan deserves all of the honor and I deserve nothing really," Souza said of being remembered by the crowd. "But to have them do that, that was pretty cool."	The Rays acquired the 26-year-old outfielder this offseason in a three-team trade that also included the San Diego Padres.	Souza punctuated his first trip back to Nationals Park, leading off the fifth inning by blasting Zimmermann's 1-1 slider into the Rays' left-field bullpen, roughly 75 feet beyond the spot of his famous catch.	"I wanted to get him out," Zimmermann said. "Couldn't do it tonight. First at-bat he gets a base hit and the second at-bat I hang a slider and he makes me pay."	Casali followed Souza's blast two batters later with a line-drive shot that landed about eight rows deep in the left-field seats.	The Rays made it 3-0 in the sixth when Ian Desmond bobbled Logan Forsythe's potential double-play grounder.	SLIPPERY WHEN WET	It became 5-0 in the eighth after pitcher Blake Treinen and right fielder Bryce Harper each committed throwing errors on Souza's bunt single, with Treinen's throw sailing over the head of first baseman Danny Espinosa in the rain.	"He just threw it high," said Nationals manager Matt Williams when asked if Treinen should have just held the ball. "Of course it's raining cats and dogs and other creatures.slick ball, but if he throws it on the bag he's out."	BELISARIO'S BLAST	Right-hander Ronald Belisario pitched two scoreless innings in his Rays debut. And in the top of the ninth, he surprised his new club with long flyout to the left-field warning track.	"That shocked me," Cash said. "I think it shocked the whole dugout."	TRAINER'S ROOM:	Rays: LHP Matt Moore came out of his third rehab start feeling strong, Cash said. "Every outing it seems like he's getting more confident," Cash said. Moore allowed two runs on four hits in 4 2/3 innings with Class A Charlotte.	Nationals: RHP Stephen Strasburg could return to the Nationals for his next start following a successful rehab outing with Double-A Harrisburg on Wednesday. "It's a possibility," said Williams after Strasburg allowed one run over five innings. "We have to see how he is feeling after today and how he gets through his bullpen, which won't be for a couple more days." ... CF Denard Span was out of Wednesday's lineup with back tightness.	UP NEXT:	Nationals RHP Doug Fister (2-2, 4.31) comes off the disabled list to face Rays RHP Chris Archer (7-4, 2.00 ERA), who returns to the site of his first career start.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

NEW YORK --  Christian Yelich saved Joe Girardi from a difficult decision.	Yelich broke up Michael Pineda's no-hit bid with a home run on the first pitch of the seventh inning, and the New York Yankees held on to beat the Miami Marlins 2-1 Wednesday night.	Pineda had thrown 94 pitches through six innings, and Girardi knew he likely would remove the right-hander from the game before the end, even if the Marlins remained hitless.	"I don't think it's a situation where you can let a guy throw 130, 140 pitches," the Yankees' manager said. "It would be extremely difficult for me and I would feel bad, but sometimes as a manager you have to protect players from themselves."	Alex Rodriguez singled twice off Miami rookie Jose Urena (1-3) to raise his career hits total to 2,997. Marlins first baseman Justin Bour saved two runs with a diving catch, and an overturned call at home plate prevented Miami from scoring the tying run in the eighth inning.	"It was as fun a game as we played all year," Rodriguez said. "There was all types of things going on. If you like baseball, tonight was a good one."	Rodriguez lined an RBI single to center in the first inning, singled softly to center in the fifth, walked twice to reach in all four plate appearances and also was thrown out at home plate. With New York starting an eight-game homestand, he has a good chance to get No. 3,000 at home.	"It's always on your mind a little bit," he said.	Carlos Beltran hit an RBI single for a 2-0 lead in the fifth, and the overturned call helped New York win for only the second time in seven games.	Plate umpire Dale Scott ruled Adeiny Hechavarria slid home ahead of first baseman Garrett Jones' throw on Dee Gordon's grounder, but a video review concluded catcher Brian McCann grabbed the high throw and tagged Hechavarria's left knee before his foot touched home.	"You catch it and dive to where you think the slide's going to be," McCann said.	Hechavarria thought the run should have counted.	"I really thought my foot got in there," he said through a translator. "After the play happened, I came into the clubhouse and looked at the replay and still believe I was safe."	Pineda (8-3) was back on regular rest and regained his electric slider. After the Yankees skipped his turn in an effort to limit his innings, the 26-year-old right-hander allowed six runs in an 11-3 loss at Baltimore on 10 days' rest.	He retired his first 11 batters against the Marlins, then walked Yelich with two outs in the fourth and Bour with one out in the fifth.	Pineda needed 43 pitches to retire his first nine batters, but threw 20 pitches in the fourth inning and 19 in the fifth, raising his total to 82. It was only then he realized he had not allowed a hit.	Girardi had been hoping for quick innings.	"What if he got seven first-pitch outs?" he said. "I doubt that that's going to happen, but I mean it's possible, right?"	Girardi thought back to May 10, when he pulled Pineda after eight innings and a career-high 111 pitches against Baltimore.	"I was in a bad spot there. People questioned me pulling him out with 16 strikeouts, to go for the (club) record," he said.	Yelich reached down for a 91 mph fastball and sent it into the Yankees' bullpen for Miami's first ball out of the infield. Pineda retired the next two batters, then was replaced by Chasen Shreve following his 100th pitch. Pineda struck out nine.	Dellin Betances relieved Justin Wilson with runners at the corners and one out in the eighth and finished the three-hitter for his fourth save. With two on and two outs in the ninth, Jeff Mathis struck out when he swung over an 86 mph breaking ball.	"Thank goodness for review," Girardi said.	WEB GEM	Bour made a diving backhand play at first to rob Jones of a two-run hit in the seventh, the ball sticking out of his glove's webbing.	SIGNING	New York has agreed to a $1.8 million signing bonus with shortstop Kyle Holder, the 30th overall pick in the amateur draft, which is below the $1,914,900 slot value.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: First baseman Mark Teixeira sat out with a sore neck that has been bothering him for a week. ... Right-hander Masahiro Tanaka, who has made three starts since returning from the disabled list, will start Sunday against Detroit on five days' rest. Adam Warren will start Friday's series opener, and the Yankees have not said who will start Saturday. Nathan Eovaldi, knocked out in the first inning Tuesday, and Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre's Bryan Mitchell appear to be the candidates. ...

PHILADELPHIA --  The Baltimore Orioles only needed two homers this time.	A night after setting a club record with eight home runs in a defeat of Philadelphia, Chris Parmelee homered for the third time in two games and Travis Snider also went deep as Baltimore handed the Phillies their ninth straight defeat, 6-4 on Wednesday night.	"I'm seeing the ball well right now, and just trying to keep it simple and kind of ride the wave as long as you can," Parmelee said.	The Orioles still finished six homers shy of the club record they set in Tuesday's 19-3 victory over Philadelphia. David Lough doubled and had two RBI for Baltimore, which won its 12th game in the last 14.	"Usually in April and May, that's like fighters in early rounds," Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said. "Sooner or later, you've got to start throwing punches."	Ubaldo Jimenez (5-3) struck out eight and walked none while giving up four runs on eight hits in 6 2/3 innings. Zach Britton pitched a scoreless ninth for his 18th save.	"When you go against a team that is struggling, you have to put your foot on the pedal and give everything you have," Jimenez said. "We know because we've been there. The last few weeks, we've been putting everything together."	Freddy Galvis homered and Ben Revere had a pair of hits, including a triple for Philadelphia, which has lost 19 of 22 to sink to 23 games under .500. Philadelphia has been outscored 57-18 during the skid while getting outhomered 19-2.	"It's surprising," Phillies manager Ryne Sandberg said of the club's record.	The Phillies returned home after a historically bad road trip in which they lost all eight games, marking the first time since their inaugural season in 1883 that they went winless on a road trip of at least eight games.	They didn't do any better at home. At least the bullpen phone stayed on the hook this time.	Adding to the embarrassment of Tuesday's blowout in Baltimore, Sandberg was unable to get a reliever warming up to spell outfielder Jeff Francoeur, filling in as a reliever, because the bullpen phone was off the hook. Pitching coach Bob McClure ended up waiving a white towel to get the bullpen's attention. In the end, no one was called in to relieve Francoeur, who threw 48 pitches in two innings, prompting Chase Utley to bark at McClure during a mound visit. Francoeur was out of the starting lineup Wednesday and grounded into a game-ending double play as a pinch-hitter.	"It's a mishap that can happen, but can never happen again," Phillies GM Ruben Amaro Jr. said before Wednesday's game.	Parmelee, who was called up from Triple-A on Tuesday, homered off Kevin Correia (0-1) with two outs in the first inning. Parmelee had two of Baltimore's eight home runs while matching a career high with four hits Tuesday. Utley tied it in the bottom of the frame when he scored on a wild pitch.	Baltimore tallied four unearned runs in the fourth inning that started when Galvis committed his 10th error of the season when he couldn't field Snider's grounder to short.	"I don't think he should have 10 errors," Sandberg said. "That's a play I've seen him make."	Matt Wieters and Jimenez had RBI singles sandwiched around Lough's two-run double.	The Phillies had a chance to get back in the game in the bottom half when Maikel Franco singled and Ryan Howard doubled to put runners on second and third with no outs. But three straight strikeouts, by Domonic Brown, Cameron Rupp and Cody Asche, erased the threat.	"Those things add up," Sandberg said.	Snider led off the fifth with a homer to right off Correia to make it 6-1, leading to cheers from a large contingent of Orioles fans among the 26,162 fans in attendance.	Correia, who was making his second start for the Phillies and third in the big leagues since last August, allowed six runs -- two earned -- and seven hits in five innings with four strikeouts and a walk.	Jimenez retired 10 straight before Rupp's one-out single in the seventh. Asche followed by beating the defensive shift with a bunt single before Galvis pulled the Phillies within 6-4 with his second homer of the season, ending Jimenez's night.	SANDBERG'S STATUS	In spite of at least one local columnist calling for major changes to the Phillies, Amaro gave Sandberg a vote of confidence before the game.	"I come every day to try to grind out wins and improve the guys," Sandberg said. "That's my mentality."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: OF Adam Jones (shoulder) missed his second straight game. Manager Buck Showalter said before the game that Jones was available to pinch hit.	Phillies: RHP Jerome Williams was placed on the 15-day DL with a strained left hamstring. Williams was injured trying to cover home plate in the first inning on Tuesday. The Phillies recalled right-hander Hector Neris from Triple-A Lehigh Valley to replace Williams.	UP NEXT	Orioles: RHP Bud Norris (2-4, 8.29) looks to complete the sweep of the Phillies in the second of two in Philadelphia of the four-game home-and-home set. Norris has received a staff-best 3.50 runs of support over his eight starts.	Phillies: RHP Sean O'Sullivan (1-5, 5.08) is winless with an 8.64 ERA in four games, three starts, against Baltimore.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.	Jhoulys Chacín has agreed to a guaranteed $1.25 million, one-year contract with the Rockies.	The Milwaukee Brewers acquired infielder Mike Brosseau from the Tampa Bay Rays for minor league pitcher Evan Reifert on Saturday in a trade between division winners.

TORONTO --  Drew Hutchison bounced back from a brutal road start with another fine effort at home.	Danny Valencia hit a three-run homer, Kevin Pillar had a solo shot and the Toronto Blue Jays beat the New York Mets 8-0 Wednesday night behind Hutchison.	The right-hander allowed career highs of nine hits and eight runs in his previous outing, June 12 at Boston, but fared much better against the Mets. He gave up four hits in 5 2/3 innings, walked one and struck out five.	"His fastball was kind of overpowering tonight," manager John Gibbons said. "It was a good outing for him, a tight ballgame. It was what we needed."	Hutchison (6-1) improved to 5-1 with a 2.38 ERA in seven starts at Rogers Centre. He's 1-0 with a 9.46 ERA in seven road outings.	"I wasn't as sharp as I'd have liked," Hutchison said. "I threw too many pitches. I would have liked to get a little deeper into the game. But I was able to make big pitches when I needed to."	Pillar went 3 for 4 with two RBI as the Blue Jays, whose 11-game winning streak ended with Monday's 11-inning loss to the Mets at Citi Field, won the opener of a five-game homestand. Toronto is 12-3 in June.	The Blue Jays lead the majors with 369 runs. Entering play Wednesday, Arizona was second with 291.	The Mets dropped to 10-20 on the road. They've lost 12 of 15 away from home.	"We've got to start playing better on the road," manager Terry Collins said. "We've got to start winning some games."	Hutchison left after Michael Cuddyer's double in the sixth. Steve Delabar came on and got Travis d'Arnaud to ground out.	Pillar got the Blue Jays started with a two-out RBI single off Jonathon Niese (3-7) in the second. Chris Colabello singled home Josh Donaldson after his leadoff double in the sixth.	Pillar made it 3-0 with a first-pitch homer off Niese in the seventh.	Niese, who allowed three runs and seven hits in seven innings, has not won in seven starts. Even so, Collins was impressed by what Niese did against the Blue Jays, who came in batting .313 against lefties.	"That might be the best lineup against left-handed pitching that there is in the game," Collins said. "To give us seven solid innings and keep us in the game, he pitched absolutely outstanding."	Toronto put the game away with a five-run eighth against Akeel Morris, who was making his major league debut after getting called up Monday directly from Class A St. Lucie. Ezequiel Carrera's bunt single brought home a run, Russell Martin hit an RBI single and Valencia followed with a three-run drive to left.	MORRIS MOVES ON	Following the game, the Mets optioned Morris to Double-A Binghamton and selected RHP Logan Verrett from Triple-A Las Vegas. "It didn't go the way I drew it up," Morris said of his difficult debut. "You shake it off and get back at it next time."	RUNNING MAN	Blue Jays 1B Justin Smoak came on as a pinch-runner for Edwin Encarnacion in the eighth. It was the first time in Smoak's career he'd been used to pinch run.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: 2B Daniel Murphy (left quadriceps) went 1 for 3 in an extended spring game. Murphy is expected to play rehab games at Double-A or Triple-A before being activated ahead of next Tuesday's game at Milwaukee.	Blue Jays: 2B Devon Travis (left shoulder) will join Triple-A Buffalo on Thursday. Travis has played the past three games at Double-A New Hampshire after sitting out more than two weeks with lingering soreness. Gibbons said Travis could rejoin the team this weekend.	UP NEXT	Mets: RHP Bartolo Colon (9-4, 4.41 ERA) seeks to join Pittsburgh's Gerrit Cole and become the second NL pitcher with double digit wins. Colon is 10-5 with a 4.02 ERA in 25 career starts against Toronto.	Blue Jays: RHP R.A. Dickey (2-6, 5.29) faces his former team for the first time since being traded to Toronto in November 2012. Dickey won the NL Cy Young Award with the Mets in 2012, going 20-6 with a 2.73 ERA. The veteran knuckleballer is winless in four starts.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

CLEVELAND -- Kris Bryant and Kyle Schwarber provided a major boost to the Chicago Cubs' offense on Wednesday night.	Bryant had a grand slam and Schwarber was 4-for-5, including his first major league hit and RBI, and the Cubs hit four home runs to rout the Cleveland Indians 17-0.	The Cubs scored seven times in the ninth inning, which ended with Indians position players Ryan Raburn and David Murphy pitching.	The offensive outburst was the most runs scored in a shutout win by the Cubs since they blanked San Diego 19-0 on May 13, 1969.	The Indians suffered their most lopsided defeat since losing 23-2 at Minnesota on June 4, 2002.	Chicago's rising young stars stole the show on the offense's big night.	"They're going to keep getting better," Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. "I'm telling you, man, that was a nice night. You get a glimpse of what it looks like when everybody's here."	Schwarber, the fourth pick in last year's draft who was called up Tuesday, tripled in the second to key a six-run inning and added an RBI single in the third when the Cubs scored four times.	Schwarber hit into a double play in the fourth and singled in the seventh. He added an infield hit in the ninth.	Schwarber's stay in the majors is expected to be brief. The plan is for him to DH in interleague games at Cleveland and Minnesota this week and send him to Triple-A Iowa, where he will continue to be used as a catcher.	Asked if a four-hit night is making a case to stay in the majors, Schwarber said, "I'm just doing my job. I'm trying to take advantage of the opportunity I have. I'm trying to do my best and have good at-bats every day."	"He had good swings," Maddon said. "He's a kid who's a good hitter who knows he's a good hitter. He's a wise young man with an exceptional work ethic."	Bryant, who was called up from Iowa on April 17, leads National League rookies in hits, RBI, runs scored and on-base percentage.	Indians starter Shaun Marcum lasted only two innings, forcing manager Terry Francona to use six relievers to get through the eighth.	"Getting in that situation doesn't feel good," Francona said. "Early on, we started asking ourselves,  'Can we not ruin our bullpen tonight?' It turns out we had to. It's still not a lot of fun."	Raburn was given a loud ovation by the crowd of 15,572 while warming up.	In the ninth, Chris Coghlan drew a four-pitch walk before Starlin Castro flied out to deep center. After Schwarber squibbed a hit to the left side of the infield, Chris Denorfia lined out to third.	With a 2-0 count on David Ross, Murphy replaced Raburn. It appeared Murphy would get out of the inning when Ross hit a popup to shallow center. Rookie Francisco Lindor settled under the ball, but it fell behind him and he was charged with an error.	Murphy allowed a hit, walked one and hit a batter before Bryant's grand slam.	Addison Russell, another of the Cubs' highly regarded rookies, and Anthony Rizzo each hit two-run homers in the second, and Denorfia, who had four RBI, added a three-run homer in the third. Chicago sent nine men to the plate in the second and third innings.	Tsuyoshi Wada (1-1) pitched seven scoreless innings for his first win since Aug. 24, 2014.	Schwarber, 23, hit .320 with 13 home runs and 39 RBI in 58 games at Double-A Tennessee. He caught the top of the ninth and struck out in his first at-bat Tuesday.	Marcum (3-2) allowed six runs and six hits.	Coghlan led off the second with a single. With one out, Schwarber hit a hard ground ball to the right side. First baseman Carlos Santana appeared to be in position to make the play, but the ball went under his glove and rolled into the right-field corner. The play was ruled a triple and Coghlan scored.	Russell homered into the bleachers for a 4-0 lead, and Rizzo, breaking an 0-for-18 slump, homered to right.	Schwarber singled for another run in the third before Denorfia hit his first homer of the season.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: C Miguel Montero (back stiffness) was a late scratch from the lineup, but Maddon expects him to play Thursday. Ross replaced Montero.	Indians: Francona says there's no timetable for the return of OF Nick Swisher (sore left knee), who was placed on the 15-day DL on Sunday.	UP NEXT	Cubs: RHP Jason Hammel makes his first start against Cleveland since June 26, 2013. He is 0-3 with a 5.40 ERA in eight appearances, including four starts, against the Indians.	Indians: RHP Danny Salazar seeks his career-high seventh victory of the season. He has won three straight decisions at Progressive Field, posting a 3.16 ERA over 25⅔ innings.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ATLANTA --  Nothing came easily for the Braves' offense, but manager Fredi Gonzalez liked what he saw.	"We battled offensively," he said. "We had to scratch and claw for every single run."	Nick Markakis singled in the go-ahead run in the seventh inning, Pedro Ciriaco added a pair of RBI singles and Atlanta beat the struggling Boston Red Sox 5-2 on Wednesday night.	The Red Sox, who began the night in last place and eight games out in the AL East, have dropped eight of nine overall and 11 of 12 on the road.	Red Sox manager John Farrell showed his frustration in the bottom of the seventh, getting ejected for arguing balls and strikes.	Atlanta, which has won three of five, took its first lead at 3-2 in the seventh when Markakis singled to score Cameron Maybin. Markakis' hit came off Junichi Tazawa (0-3), who gave up three hits, two runs and one walk in two-thirds of an inning.	"It's first and third with one out," Markakis said. "I'm just trying to put the ball in play and not hit into a double play."	Tommy Layne relieved Tazawa and gave up a bases-loaded walk to A.J. Pierzynski that made it 4-2. Craig Breslow, the sixth Boston pitcher, allowed Maybin's RBI single that made it 5-2 in the eighth.	Nick Masset (2-1) earned the win in relief, facing four batters in the seventh, and Jason Grilli recorded his 18th save in 20 chances. Mookie Betts led off the ninth with a single, but Grilli struck out Blake Swihart, and pinch-hitter David Ortiz and Dustin Pedroia each popped up.	Farrell's ejection marked the third time he left the dugout and returned dissatisfied.	He lost an instant replay challenge in the first when Brock Holt was thrown out at second on Xander Bogaerts' fielder's choice. In the second, Farrell failed to persuade first-base umpire and crew chief Larry Vanover to request a video review after Betts was called out on a close play at first.	In the seventh, Vanover tossed Farrell for yelling from the dugout on Ciriaco's check swing.	"It was clearly a full swing, and he ran me at that point," Farrell said. "So I went out to argue my case."	Boston took a 1-0 lead in the fourth when starting pitcher Joe Kelly, batting with the bases loaded, beat out second baseman Jace Peterson's throw for a single.	Braves third baseman Juan Uribe amended his throwing error from the top of the fourth with a leadoff single in the bottom of the inning. Uribe advanced to second on a groundout and scored on Ciriaco's RBI single to make it 1-1.	Mike Napoli's 10th homer, solo shot in the sixth, put the Red Sox up 2-1.	In the bottom of the sixth, Markakis scored from third on Ciriaco's single off Alexi Ogando, the third Boston pitcher of the inning.	Kelly allowed five hits, two runs, three walks and struck out three in five-plus innings. Kelly was chased by Uribe's single in the sixth.	Braves starter Alex Wood gave up five hits, two walks, struck out seven and allowed two runs -- one earned.	It was Wood's best start at home after going 0-3 with a 6.00 ERA in his first four outings at Turner Field this year.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: RHP Justin Masterson, on the 15-day disabled list since May 13 with shoulder tendinitis, allowed four hits, two runs, three walks and struck out four in six innings in a rehab start Tuesday with Triple-A Pawtucket.	Braves: 1B Freddie Freeman went 0 for 3 before leaving after the sixth inning with a sprained right hand. Freeman said he had a cortisone shot, will miss Thursday's game and hopes to return Friday against the New York Mets. ... SS Andrelton Simmons was out of the lineup for the second straight day with a right hand injury. Ciriaco started in his place and went 3 for 4.	UP NEXT	Red Sox: RHP Clay Buchholz (3-6) allowed 18 hits and eight runs in receiving no decision in his last two starts.	Braves: RHP Shelby Miller (5-2) will try to win for the first time in his last six starts. He ranks fifth in the NL with a 2.02 ERA.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CINCINNATI --  Todd Frazier was out of the Reds' lineup on Thursday for a needed day off. The whole team got some rest when Cincinnati's game against the Detroit Tigers was postponed because of rain.	Now the third baseman can be refreshed when he resumes his push for the All-Star Game.	Frazier is making his case with a mid-June hitting tear. He hit four homers in the last two games against Detroit, including a grand slam in the 13th inning for an 8-4 win on Wednesday. His 22nd homer finally ended the game at 1:20 a.m.	The final game of the series on Thursday was called off because rain moved in before the scheduled start time and was expected to continue well into the night. It wasn't immediately rescheduled.	Manager Bryan Price expects to have Frazier back in the lineup on Friday when the Reds host Miami.	"He's a special guy, not just as a performer but as a person," Price said. "He's really taken it upon himself to be a guy who's delivering consistently in the middle of our order. It's been fun to watch from my seat, for sure."	Frazier made his first All-Star team last season and reached the final round of the home run derby, losing to Yoenis Cespedes. The game is in Cincinnati next month, and Frazier loves hitting at Great American Ball Park, where he's batting .364 with 14 homers this season.	Frazier is lagging in fan voting for the starter at third base, so he'd likely have to be chosen as a reserve.	"You've got to be confident in yourself," Frazier said. "Right now, the votes are a little tough. At the same time, I do think I deserve to be there. I think it would be a great opportunity for me.	"You want to start in whatever you do, especially in baseball. I'm not mad at anybody. That's just the way the voting is. I think it needs to be changed. Right now, that's the way we go about it. I just want to the opportunity to play, and you never know."	Frazier is on one of the best hitting tears of his career. He hit two solo homers in a 5-2 win in Detroit on Tuesday night, followed by his solo shot and game-ending grand slam a day later.	There's nothing elaborate involved.	"I don't really do too much before the game, don't look at too much film," he said. "I just go back to the basics.	"When you first start hitting, you understand you're going up there trying to crush the ball. That's basically what I'm trying to do. If you get the right pitch to hit and your mind's nice and relaxed, most of the time you're going to hit the ball hard. And that's what I'm trying to do."	RAIN, RAIN, RAIN ...	The game was called after a 37-minute delay. There have been nine rain delays at Great American this season totaling 13 hours, 40 minutes, with two games postponed. The Tigers and Reds have three common off days in August to make it up.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: Victor Martinez will join the Tigers in New York for the start of a series against the Yankees on Friday and is expected to be activated off the disabled list. He's been sidelined since May 19 with an inflamed left knee. ... Alex Avila will catch in the bullpen on Friday to test his sore left knee.	Reds: Rookie right-hander Jon Moscot will have surgery on his dislocated left shoulder. He's expected to be ready for spring training.	UP NEXT	Tigers: Justin Verlander (0-0), who was scheduled to pitch on Thursday, will open the series in New York. It's his second start after missing the first two months with a strained right triceps. It'll be his 800th career start, making him the eighth Tigers pitcher to reach the mark.	Reds: Mike Leake (3-4), who was scheduled to start on Thursday, will open the series against the Marlins.	---	Follow Joe Kay on Twitter: http://twitter.com/apjoekay	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

CHICAGO -- Less heralded than the other starters in the Pittsburgh Pirates' rotation, Jeff Locke is happy to do his part along with his more famous and accomplished teammates.	Locke allowed just two runs in six innings, Jung Ho Kang hit a two-run home run and the Pirates beat the struggling Chicago White Sox 3-2 Wednesday night for their seventh straight win.	"It just makes you proud and fortunate to be a part of it," Locke said. "I think you just try to pick up where these guys leave off and try to find anyway to come up with a win."	The Pirates, who had thrown three straight shutouts -- and five in the previous six -- saw their streak of scoreless innings end at 35.	Locke (4-3) gave up three hits and had a season-high eight strikeouts. He was followed by Arquimedes Caminero, Tony Watson and Mark Melancon, who combined for scoreless relief over the final three innings with Melancon getting his 22nd save.	"It's always strange to me when our pitchers give up a run," Pittsburgh infielder Josh Harrison said. "It had to come at some point. I'm glad it came in a win."	The White Sox, who snapped a string of 30 consecutive scoreless innings with two runs in the sixth, lost their season-high sixth straight.	White Sox starter John Danks (3-7) settled down after a shaky first inning to allow three runs on five hits in seven innings.	"Besides the first inning, Johnny pitched great," Chicago manager Robin Ventura said of Danks. "Somehow we have to get over the first inning."	The Pirates scored their three runs in the first inning. Harrison led off with a double, advanced to third on a sacrifice and scored on a single by Andrew McCutchen. Kang then homered to make it 3-0.	The White Sox have been outscored 56-19 in the first inning this season. The 56 runs are the most allowed and the 19 runs the fewest scored in the majors.	Danks got in a groove after the homer and retire 19 of the final 20 batters he faced.	"Got a couple of balls up in the first and then I was able to keep the ball down," Danks said.	Chicago didn't get its first hit until the fourth inning, and that came with two outs and nobody on -- after a double play in which Melky Cabrera struck out swinging and was called for interfering with catcher Francisco Cervelli throwing to second base. By rule, the runner, Adam Eaton, was out as well.	Ventura argued the call and was ejected by home plate umpire Alfonso Marquez.	Locke cruised into the sixth inning with a one-hitter and retired the first two batters. But just when it appeared Pittsburgh's scoreless streak would reach 36 innings, Eaton drew a two-out walk and Cabrera followed with a double down the left-field line on a hit-and-run play. Eaton easily scored to make it 3-1. After a walk to Jose Abreu, Avisail Garcia singled to score Cabrera and make it 3-2.	"He had five masterful innings," Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said. "He's working better, he's looking better. The last two outings he's been clean."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: LHP Starling Marte left the game in the ninth inning with left ankle discomfort. "He tweaked his ankle when he hit the bag (in the top of the eighth) and then he probably re-tweaked it on that ball in the outfield (in the bottom of the eighth)," Hurdle said.	UP NEXT: Pirates RHP Gerrit Cole (10-2, 1.71 ERA) leads the major leagues in wins and has won each of his last five starts with a 0.76 ERA over the stretch. Chicago counters with RHP Jeff Samardzija (4-4, 4.84), who has struggled of late.	STRANDED RUNNERS	Besides the scoreless innings streak, the Pirates entered Wednesday with a streak of 28 innings without allowing a runner to reach third base. That string also ended in the sixth at 33.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Joe Blanton's victory drought is over.	Blanton picked up his first victory in nearly two years with five solid innings and Alcides Escobar equaled his career high with four RBI as the Kansas City Royals pounded the Milwaukee Brewers 10-2 on Wednesday night.	Blanton (1-0) had not won since June 29, 2013, while with the Los Angeles Angels against Houston. He limited the Brewers to one run and five hits. The 34-year-old right-hander struck out four and walked none, throwing a season high 73 pitches.	"I don't know exactly how long, but it's been awhile," Blanton said. "At one point, it feels like a long way back. You think you have I lost it. You just don't know. I fixed some mechanical things and fortunate enough to be back."	Blanton, who made seven relief appearances after beginning the season in the minors, was making his first major league start since July 22, 2013. He finished that season with a 2-14 record and 6.04 ERA and was released by the Angels in spring training 2014 and did not pitch in the majors that year.	"It's not ideal," Blanton said. "I wouldn't recommend it, not really what you want to do, taking a year off. But in hindsight, it turned out to be a pretty good thing for me.	Ryan Madson, who had not pitched in the majors since 2011, relieved Blanton in the sixth.	"Quite frankly when you get to spring training and you look at Joe Blanton and Ryan Madson, you think, `ok well, these guys had good careers, but do they have anything left," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "It was real evident in spring training early that they both had a lot left in their tank."	Escobar tripled with the bases loaded in a four-run eighth. He also singled home a run in a three-run second. It was his third four-RBI game.	Lorenzo Cain, who homered the past two games in Milwaukee, tripled, doubled, walked twice, drove in a run and scored a run, extending his hitting streak to eight games. Cain's triple in a three-run fifth scored Kendrys Morales.	With the victory, Ned Yost ties Whitey Herzog as the winningest manager in Royals' history at 410 wins.	Right-hander Mike Fiers (3-7) took the loss, giving up six runs on eight hits and three walks in five innings.	"We just didn't get much going all night," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. "Mike wasn't sharp tonight. They put good at-bats on you and put the ball in play. He only had two strikeouts, which is a low number for him."	The Brewers have lost five straight.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: OF Carlos Gomez, who sat out the previous two games with tightness in his right leg, was the DH and had two of the Brewers' six hits.	Royals: LHP Danny Duffy (left biceps tendinitis) made a rehab start Wednesday for Triple-A Omaha, throwing 40 strikes in 65 pitches in 3 2/3 innings against Iowa. He allowed two runs on three hits, including a home run, walked none, hit a batter and struck out six.	UP NEXT	Brewers: LHP Jimmy Nelson gave up a career high 10 hits in five innings in his previous start, a 7-2 loss to the Nationals.	Royals: RHP Jeremy Guthrie, who starts the series finale, is 1-0 with a 1.50 ERA in his past three home starts.	INFANTE VOTE PUZZLING	Royals 2B Omar Infante moved to the top of the AL All-Star voting as his position, although he is hitting .227.  Yost acknowledged Jason Kipnis of the Indians and Jose Atuve of the Astros are having "great" seasons. "If you don't like it get out and vote," Yost said. "Cleveland fans vote for your man. Houston fans vote for your man. I'm not in charge of voting."	MILLION PASSED	The Wednesday crowd 33,420 pushed the Royals' season total to more than 1 million after 31 home dates. That is the earliest in franchise history to reach a million.	ROYALS SIGN TOP PICK	First-round draft pick RHP Ashe Russell signed with the Royals and will be assigned to their Burlington (North Carolina) club in the Appalachian League.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

MINNEAPOLIS --  A banner May had given way to a horrible June, and Minnesota Twins manager Paul Molitor was desperate for a win.	That meant going to closer Glen Perkins in the eighth inning. The All-Star made it interesting, but stayed perfect.	Perkins pitched four outs to improve to 23 for 23 in save chances and Tommy Milone gave up one run in seven innings to help the Twins squeak out a 3-1 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals on Wednesday night.	"He was rested," Molitor said. "And it seemed like a night where we really need a win."	Milone (3-1) gave up five hits and struck out five and Eduardo Nunez had two hits and two RBI to help the reeling Twins, who had lost seven of their previous eight games.	Carlos Martinez (7-3) gave up two runs -- one earned -- on five hits and struck out six in 6 2/3 innings for the Cardinals, who are embroiled in a federal investigation into allegations that members of the team's baseball operations hacked into the Houston Astros' personnel database.	The Cardinals had two runners on with no outs in the ninth, but Perkins struck out Mark Reynolds and Randal Grichuk and got Yadier Molina to ground out to end it.	"Whether it's three outs or four outs, it doesn't matter," Perkins said. "I want to win and we did tonight."	The Cardinals have spent the last two days swimming in deep water after news broke that the FBI was conducting an investigation into the hacking allegations involving a database compiled by former Cardinals executive Jeff Luhnow, now the Astros' GM.	Cardinals chairman Bill DeWitt and GM John Mozeliak responded forcefully on Wednesday, saying that they had no knowledge of any such actions and were conducting an internal review of their own to get to determine if there was any truth to the allegations.	Until then, Mozeliak and manager Mike Matheny vowed not to let the headline-grabbing allegations, which have called into question the integrity of one of baseball's model franchises, distract the team from the torrid pace it has set to start this season. The Cardinals entered the game with the best record in the big leagues, having beaten the Twins at home on Tuesday on the day the investigation was revealed by the New York Times.	They jumped on Milone in the second inning, getting an RBI single from Jason Heyward for a 1-0 lead.	But Reynolds was charged with an error for being unable to scoop a low pickoff attempt from Martinez at first base, which allowed Trevor Plouffe to score from third and put Eddie Rosario in position to score on a sacrifice fly from Nunez to give the Twins a 2-1 lead in the fourth.	"You can't give free bases," Matheny said. "If you don't pay any attention to the guy at first base then you've got no chance at a double play. He's got to. He's a great athlete. He can do that all day long, just made a bad throw."	A combination of the Cardinals' enthusiastic fan base and the home debut of highly touted Twins prospect Byron Buxton led to an announced crowd of 34,381, the third-largest of the season at Target Field.	Buxton went 0 for 3 with two strikeouts, but did make a nice running catch at the warning track in the third inning.	Struggling star Joe Mauer was moved from third in the order to second. He had a double in the first inning, but struck out twice, including with two outs and the bases loaded in the seventh.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Twins: GM Terry Ryan said RHP Ricky Nolasco, on the disabled list with an ankle injury, was being fitted for orthotics. The club was hopeful that the orthotics would help relieve what has been a recurring for issue for him.	UP NEXT	The Twins send RHP Mike Pelfrey (5-3, 3.18) to the mound to finish the four-game split series against LHP Jaime Garcia (2-3, 2.06). Pelfrey had been a pleasant surprise for the Twins through 11 starts, but was tagged for eight runs on 11 hits in a loss to the Rangers his last time out. Garcia missed the first 40 games while recovering from thoracic outlet surgery. He has not walked a batter in his last four starts.	ROSTER MOVES	The Twins signed first-round draft pick Tyler Jay, a left-handed pitcher from the University of Illinois. Jay was the sixth overall pick and the Twins will start him at Class-A Fort Myers in a relief role. GM Terry Ryan said Jay could eventually be converted to a starter, but not this season.	Minnesota also released RHP Tim Stauffer after designating him for assignment on June 10.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DENVER --  Carlos Correa and the slugging Houston Astros certainly enjoyed their visit to hitter-friendly Coors Field on Wednesday night.	Correa hit one of Houston's four home runs, Brett Oberholtzer pitched effectively into the seventh inning and the Astros continued their season-long power surge with an 8-4 win over the Colorado Rockies.	Chris Carter, Preston Tucker and Jake Marisnick also homered for the first-place Astros, who have won four straight and lead the majors with 95 home runs.	"It's fun. When we're on defense we're excited to get back in there and get another at-bat," Tucker said. "Everyone felt confident today."	Correa and George Springer had three hits each, but All-Star second baseman Jose Altuve left in the third inning with more discomfort in his right hamstring.	"We've got to be so cautious with him, especially at high altitude," manager A.J. Hinch said. "I want to err on the side of caution. We can't afford to mess around with Jose."	The Astros didn't need Altuve's slick defense thanks to another big night at the plate. Houston pounded out 13 hits, including seven for extra bases.	"We got hot tonight with extra-base hits," Hinch said. "It can be an explosive offense when we get going."	Oberholtzer (2-1) followed up his eight shutout innings against Seattle on Friday with another strong outing. He allowed three runs and eight hits, struck out five and didn't walk a batter in 6 1/3 innings.	Oberholtzer worked around Charlie Blackmon's leadoff double in the sixth but left after allowing Nick Hundley's RBI single in the seventh.	"The offense came out hot and got some runs for me early," Oberholtzer said. "That gives me confidence to throw strikes and if I do miss, we're still up."	Carlos Gonzalez homered and Nolan Arenado and Troy Tulowitzki had two hits apiece for the Rockies, who have lost seven of eight. Kyle Kendrick fell to 0-4 in six Coors Field starts.	Kendrick (2-9) fell behind during a 34-pitch first inning in which the Astros took control. Springer singled to lead off and Correa, the top pick in the 2012 draft, followed with his third home run since making his major league debut June 8.	"I knew they were going to be aggressive," Kendrick said. "I tried to be aggressive myself and fell behind in counts and threw a lot of pitches. I had to battle."	Springer made it 3-0 with an RBI single in the second. Colorado got two back in the fourth on a sacrifice fly from Gonzalez and a single by Arenado.	Houston padded its lead after that. Tucker hit a solo home run in the fifth, Marisnick greeted reliever Christian Friedrich with a homer to lead off the sixth and Correa made it 6-2 with a ground-rule double that scored Jason Castro.	Carter hit a two-run homer, his 12th, off John Axford in the ninth.	YER OUT	Rockies manager Walt Weiss was ejected by second base umpire Jerry Layne for excessive arguing in the bottom of the third. Weiss was upset after the Astros were allowed to challenge a safe call on Blackmon's attempted steal of second base. The call was overturned upon review, but Weiss argued the challenge by Hinch came too late.	"The pitcher on the rubber, batter in the box, it's too late to challenge the previous play. That's the way we were told before the season started. I still felt it was too late," Weiss said.	Layne said Hinch had his foot on the top step of the dugout, which was enough to indicate he was challenging the play. The replay rule was modified before the season to allow a manager to challenge without approaching an umpire in order to speed up the replay process.	"Walt was not happy that he was allowed to challenge," Layne said. "But I don't think Walt understood when he actually initiated his challenge. You don't have to come out on the field anymore."	SIGNED AND SEALED	Brendan Rodgers signed with the Rockies, agreeing to a $5.5 million bonus. Rodgers, a shortstop out of Lake Mary High School in Florida, was the third overall pick in last week's draft. The value assigned to his slot was $6,223,300.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: Altuve missed three of the previous four games with the hamstring injury, but before the game Hinch said Altuve was doing better. Altuve will get a planned day off Thursday and said he is fine. "I feel the same. I didn't make it worse. I didn't re-injure it. (Hinch) just didn't like what he saw," Altuve said.	Rockies: OF Corey Dickerson (left plantar fasciitis) went back on the 15-day disabled list after being activated last week. Dickerson played in five games but the injury, which cost him 23 games from May 19 to June 11, flared up. He said the plantar fascia has a small tear and needs time to develop scar tissue over the injured area. There is no timetable for his return.	UP NEXT	Astros: RHP Collin McHugh (6-3, 5.08 ERA) will try to give the Astros a sweep of the four-game, home-and-home series. McHugh is coming off his shortest outing when he lasted just three innings against Seattle.	Rockies: RHP David Hale (2-1, 4.56) will try to stop Colorado's slide. Hale was a tough-luck loser in a 4-1 setback against Miami on Saturday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PHOENIX --  On a night of missed opportunities, Paul Goldschmidt and Welington Castillo didn't miss theirs.	Goldschmidt and Castillo each hit a solo home run, and the Arizona Diamondbacks held on to beat the Los Angeles Angels 3-2 Wednesday night.	Both homers came off Hector Santiago (4-4).	Yasmany Tomas had three hits for Arizona, including an RBI triple. Goldschmidt's 19th home run came in the first inning.	"He is a very smart hitter, very patient and he hits your mistakes," Santiago said. "It was weird because I threw three pitches in and then the fourth one he just seemed like, `This is what I was waiting for.' It was like it was exactly like he was waiting for that pitch."	Castillo hit his fourth homer -- second since coming to the Diamondbacks -- leading off the fourth.	Goldschmidt had two hits to raise his batting average to .363, best in the majors. He has reached base in 27 consecutive games, the longest active streak in the majors. He also made a couple of diving stops at first base.	Chase Anderson (3-1) allowed two runs and seven hits in six innings for his second straight win.	"I felt good overall. My stuff wasn't there like it was my last couple of starts," he said. "That's part of the process. We have a really good defense and we made some really good plays to help me out tonight. And the home runs definitely helped."	Los Angeles' runs came on a double-play grounder and Albert Pujols' groundout. The Angels were 0 for 9 with runners in scoring position, but manager Mike Scioscia wasn't entirely displeased.	"Some parts of tonight were very frustrating," he said, "and some parts on the offensive side we saw some good signs."	Brad Ziegler gave up a leadoff single to Chris Iannetta, but induced a double-play grounder and got his ninth save in 10 tries.	The four-game interleague series shifted to Arizona after the teams split two in Anaheim.	Anderson, who allowed one hit in seven scoreless innings at San Francisco in his previous start, blanked Los Angeles through four and the Angels were hitless until Kole Calhoun lined a single over the head of second baseman Chris Owings with one out in the fourth.	Anderson had not allowed a run in 14 2/3 innings before Matt Joyce scored from third when Iannetta grounded into a double play in the fifth.	Los Angeles made it a one-run game in the sixth, but it could have been worse for Arizona.	Calhoun's single and Mike Trout's double put runners at second and third with no outs. Diamondbacks shortstop Nick Ahmed made a diving stop of Pujols' sharp grounder, got to his feet and just got Pujols at first as Calhoun scored on the play.	"He went a far way to get that ball," Goldschmidt said. "He's one of the best shortstops in the league. He's unbelievable. It might have saved the game there."	Trout advanced to third on a flyout but was stranded when Johnny Giavotella lined to third.	Both teams squandered big scoring opportunities, Arizona in the sixth and the Angels in the seventh.	Arizona had runners at first and third with no outs in the sixth when reliever Cam Bedrosian struck out Ahmed, then Owings was caught in a rundown between third and home. Owings mistakenly thought the squeeze was on.	"Just a missed sign at a bad spot," Diamondbacks manager Chip Hale said.	Pinch-hitter Cliff Pennington grounded to first to end the inning.	Los Angeles had runners at second and third with no outs following Iannetta's single and pinch-hitter Efren Navarro's ground-rule double. But Erick Aybar popped out to the pitcher on a bunt attempt and Calhoun flied out to short center. Daniel Hudson came on to face Trout, who bounced to third to end the threat.	Joyce tripled to deep center off Hudson with two outs in the eighth, but Giavotella struck out. Hudson retired the heart of the Angels' order in his 1 1/3 innings -- Trout, Pujols and David Freese.	"That's our best guy in that situation," Hale said. "We had him in the right spot at the right time and he came through for us. That was huge tonight."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: RHP Archie Bradley (right shoulder tendinitis) is slated to pitch a simulated game on Thursday.	UP NEXT	Angels: Los Angeles wraps up the four-game, home-and-home series with LHP C.J. Wilson (4-5, 3.60 ERA) on the mound in an afternoon game.	Diamondbacks: RHP Allen Webster (1-0, 3.18) is coming off a victory in his season debut at San Francisco. He was recalled from Triple-A Reno after the team moved Josh Collmenter to the bullpen.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- Jesse Chavez had already reached double digits in strikeouts for the first time in his career and was prepping to go out for the eighth inning when Athletics manager Bob Melvin decided to go to the bullpen.	With Oakland's offense in the midst of a four-run seventh, Melvin didn't want to trot his starter out for another inning following the long break.	It was about the only respite San Diego's hitters got.	Chavez struck out a career-high 11 in seven innings to win for only the second time in his last eight starts, Billy Butler had four hits including a three-run home run and the A's beat the Padres 16-2 on Wednesday night.	"This was the best changeup we've ever seen him throw, and he threw a bunch of them tonight," Melvin said. "He was going to go out for the eighth until we scored a few more runs. I'm sure he was thinking, `Why don't you save a few of these for me for a little bit later."	Chavez (3-6) went into the game with the eighth-lowest ERA in the AL but had gotten little to no run support in his previous 10 starts.	Against the Padres, however, Chavez got more than enough backing and was dominant while allowing three hits over seven innings. He fanned seven of the first 11 batters, walked one and didn't allow a runner past first base until Alexi Amarista homered on the first pitch leading off the sixth.	Chavez said he decided to ride the changeup after getting a good feel for it while warming up.	"I felt it down in the bullpen," Chavez said. "It's a pitch that I've had most of the year. As the game went on (catcher Stephen) Vogt started having confidence and started calling it to both sides of the plate."	Ben Zobrist drove in three runs with three hits for the A's. Stephen Vogt added two RBI.	Will Middlebrooks homered for the Padres, who lost their third straight since firing manager Bud Black on Monday.	Oakland, which went into the game with the worst record in the AL, set season highs for runs and hits (20) while extending its winning streak to four.	It got so bad for San Diego that interim manager Pat Murphy used Amarista -- the Padres' starting shortstop -- to pitch and get the final out of the ninth. Amarista needed two pitches to retire Billy Burns on a fly out.	"Sometimes game happen like this," Murphy said. "You guys may laugh at this but I think this was a little bit of a cleansing. Just get this stuff out."	The A's staked Chavez to a 4-0 lead in the first inning capped by Butler's fifth home run of the season.	The former Kansas City slugger, who signed with Oakland in the offseason, had been mired in an 8-for-42 funk before homering off San Diego starter Odrisamer Despaigne (3-5). Butler also singled three times.	"We just started feeding off each other, hit some balls hard and found some holes," Butler said. "I haven't had the greatest first half but this helps things turn around."	Zobrist had an RBI single in the first, tripled in the third and added a two-run double in the seventh.	Sam Fuld and Brett Lawrie drove in two runs apiece during Oakland's seven-run eighth.	Despaigne struggled in his first career start against the A's. He gave up six runs and eight hits in six innings with two strikeouts and one walk.	Former Oakland All-Star catcher Derek Norris went 0-for-4 in his first game back at the Coliseum since being traded to San Diego in December.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: CF Will Myers will undergo surgery Thursday to remove a bone spur in his left wrist. Myers missed 28 games on the disabled list earlier this season because of soreness in the wrist.	Athletics: RHP Edward Mujica (broken thumb) will pitch for Single-A Stockton on Thursday and could be activated from the DL as soon as Friday. ... Switch pitcher Pat Venditte (right shoulder strain) is doing strengthening work but has not been cleared to throw.	UP NEXT	Padres: RHP Ian Kennedy (3-5) starts the Thursday afternoon game and has a 3.00 ERA over his previous three starts after carrying a 7.15 ERA through his first eight starts.	Athletics: RHP Kendall Graveman (3-3), who has a 2.20 ERA since getting called back up from the minors in late May, will make his first career interleague start.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

SEATTLE -- It didn't take long for Felix Hernandez to bounce back from the worst outing of his career. And he did it in impressive fashion outpitching San Francisco's Madison Bumgarner in a pitcher's duel.	Making his first start since he allowed eight runs in one-third of an inning, Hernandez pitched eight innings of four-hit ball to lead the Seattle Mariners to a 2-0 win over the Giants on Wednesday night.	"I thought he was a little bit more pumped up (than usual)," Mariners manager Lloyd McClendon said. "I can't imagine that he would be more focused than he usually is, but it was a special outing."	Hernandez (10-4) struck out five and walked two. The Mariners' ace allowed a runner to reach scoring position twice, but both times he quickly retired the side by inducing a groundout. McClendon was thinking of sending him out for the ninth, but Hernandez, at 106 pitches, thought better of it.	"He asked me," Hernandez said. "I just feel I'm done, I'm good."	The right-hander is 6-0 with a 1.60 ERA in his last nine starts following a loss. Wednesday's performance came after the debacle in Houston last Friday that matched his shortest career outing. The only other time he lasted just one out was due to an injury in a 2007 start against Minnesota.	"At least I make it through one," Hernandez said with a smile. "I was not that pumped, just trying to (do) my job."	Charlie Furbush retired the first two batters of the ninth and Carson Smith struck out Matt Duffy for his fourth save in five chances.	Bumgarner (7-4) also gave up four hits in eight innings. He struck out nine and issued one intentional walk.	He lost a perfect-game bid in the fifth, and ran into trouble in the sixth. Mike Zunino singled through the left side for a one-out hit. Austin Jackson followed with an RBI triple into the right-center field gap.	It appeared Angel Pagan, who ran a long way from his position in center, had a play on the ball, but it just missed his glove. Zunino, who had to pause to make sure the ball would drop, safely avoided a tag at the plate to give the Mariners a 1-0 lead.	"I thought he was going to catch it, but once I seen it drop, I just turned on the gear and did my best to get to third," Jackson said.	Robinson Cano followed with an RBI double.	Duffy had a pair of singles for San Francisco and is 5 for 8 in his past two outings.	UP NEXT	Mariners: Rookie Mike Montgomery makes his fourth career start in the finale of a two-game set.	Giants: A struggling Ryan Vogelsong, who is sporting a 4.81 ERA, takes the mound for San Francisco.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: McClendon confirmed that RHP Hisashi Iwakuma is still scheduled for a rehab appearance with Class A Short-Season Everett on Saturday. The former All-Star is recovering from a strained lat, one that has kept him out since April 23.	Giants: OF Gregor Blanco (concussion) could be activated from the disabled list Thursday, manager Bruce Bochy said. Blanco needed to pass the final tests Wednesday, which included taking batting practice and participating in baseball drills.	ODD BOUNCE BREAKS UP PERFECTO	Bumgarner's perfect game was broken up by a ground ball that took a large hop in front of shortstop Brandon Crawford and bounced off his chest. Crawford picked up the ball and threw high to first. The play was ruled a hit for Mark Trumbo. An error was given to Crawford after his throw allowed Trumbo to reach second.	"It was a terrible bounce, one of the worst I've seen, actually," Bumgarner said. "It's frightening."	ZUNINO'S SLIDE	When Jackson tripled in the sixth, Zunino had to hold up between first and second to make sure the ball wouldn't be caught. Once it fell safely, the catcher put it in high gear, but still had to make a nifty hook slide to avoid a tag at the plate.	"I saw him starting to come off the line, so I tried to go a little bit wider," Zunino said. "When I saw him reach, I just tried to get around him."	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

LOS ANGELES --  Like many free-swinging sluggers, it's either feast or famine for Joey Gallo -- home run or strikeout. In his first confrontation with Clayton Kershaw, the Texas Rangers' 21-year-old rookie fanned twice against the reigning NL MVP and hit a very long two-run homer in between.	Prince Fielder also went deep to help Texas beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-3 on Monday night as the teams switched venues following back-to-back home wins by the Rangers.	Kershaw gave up a leadoff single in the third inning to opposing pitcher Wandy Rodriguez, then struck out his next two batters before Gallo drove a 1-1 pitch more than halfway up the right-field pavilion for a 3-0 lead.	The homer was the fifth for Gallo, who earlier this month became the first player in franchise history to homer in each of his first two big league games. This was his first one on the road.	"I didn't know what to expect. I was just looking for something I could just put any kind of barrel on," Gallo said. "He threw a slider the pitch before and I got a pretty good look at it. Then he threw it over the plate and I was able to square it up, but it wasn't easy."	Rodriguez (4-2) shrugged off leadoff doubles by Yasiel Puig and Scott Van Slyke in each of the first two innings to win his third straight decision in a span of six starts. The left-hander is 4-0 with a 2.28 ERA in seven starts on the road.	Keone Kela pitched a hitless ninth for his first major league save. Regular closer Shawn Tolleson got the night off following three consecutive appearances.	Kershaw (5-4) allowed four runs and five hits through six innings and struck out 10 after going 3-0 with a 0.94 ERA over his previous four starts. It was the first career appearance against the Rangers for the three-time Cy Young Award winner, who was born in Dallas.	"This is probably the most frustrating game that I've pitched in a long time, all things considered," Kershaw said. "It was just a lot of frustration built up, for sure."	With outfielders Josh Hamilton and Delino DeShields both on the disabled list, Texas manager Jeff Banister gave Gallo his second start in left after 11 starts at third base and one as the designated hitter. Gallo had trouble tracking a flyball to the warning track by Adrian Gonzalez in the third, but turned himself around just in time to make the putout.	Fielder, originally scheduled to get the night off against Kershaw with the Rangers playing without the benefit of a DH, made his 11th start at first base because Kyle Blanks had inflammation in both Achilles tendons.	Fielder led off the second with a double and scored from third on an unconventional fielder's choice. Rougned Odor's Texas Leaguer dropped in front of center fielder Chris Heisey, and Adam Rosales was forced at second base after playing it halfway.	Fielder led off the ninth with his 299th career homer on a 3-0 pitch from Josh Ravin, who one night earlier allowed a game-ending homer in the ninth to Robinson Chirinos in the Rangers' 3-2 victory.	It was the fifth time in his career that Fielder homered after getting the green light on 3-0.	"I think I have it pretty much anytime I want," he said.	The Rangers added a run in the fourth with the help of a wild pitch and a balk by Kershaw. Odor's RBI single made it 4-0.	Van Slyke, in his first game off the disabled list, hit a two-run homer during the Dodgers' three-run sixth. Kike Hernandez followed with a double, and Rodriguez snared a line drive by A.J. Ellis before giving up an RBI single to pinch-hitter Alex Guerrero on his 92nd and final pitch.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: Van Slyke had missed 17 games because of inflammation in his back. ... RHP Chris Hatcher was placed on the 15-day DL, retroactive to June 15, because of an oblique strain on his left side.	UP NEXT	Rangers: RHP Anthony Ranaudo (0-1) will be recalled from Triple-A Round Rock on Thursday to make his second spot start of the season, giving everyone in the regular rotation an extra day of rest. On April 15, Ranaudo gave up six runs and six hits in 1 1/3 innings of a 10-2 home loss against the Angels.	Dodgers: RHP Zack Greinke (5-2) is 0-2 in his last seven starts despite a 2.28 ERA. The Dodgers scored fewer than three runs in five of those games, including last Saturday's 2-1 loss at San Diego, when the 2009 AL Cy Young Award winner went the distance for the first time this season.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PHILADELPHIA --  A rare victory had the Philadelphia Phillies pulling pranks.	When the clubhouse opened Thursday after a 2-1 win over the Baltimore Orioles ended a nine-game losing streak, ace lefty Cole Hamels' locker was empty and his nameplate above it was gone. Since the rebuilding Phillies are trying to trade the three-time All-Star, it appeared perhaps they had struck a deal.	But it was just a joke.	No player owned up to the deed, though several guys were laughing about it. A team spokesman said he didn't know who was responsible for it.	Closer Jonathan Papelbon, a natural suspect, denied it.	"I don't know anything about Cole," Papelbon said.	For a team with the worst record in the majors at 23-45, the Phillies are trying to keep the mood light. During a 19-3 loss at Baltimore on Tuesday, the bullpen was phone off the hook while right fielder Jeff Francoeur pitched two innings.	"It feels good to get off a losing streak," Papelbon said. "It's tough losing. Nobody wants to lose. Nobody likes losing. We do anything we can to prepare to win a game, but things haven't been going our way."	Ryan Howard hit a go-ahead, two-run homer in the sixth inning to help the Phillies avoid being swept in four consecutive series. They had lost 19 of 22 and were outscored 57-18 during their skid.	"It's what the situation is," Howard said. "You have to come with the mindset of trying to compete."	Manny Machado hit his third career leadoff homer and second in three games against the Phillies. But he struck out with runners on first and third and one out in the seventh.	Jake Diekman (1-1) pitched a 1-2-3 sixth in relief of Sean O'Sullivan to earn the win in his first game back from a brief stint at Triple-A.	Luis Garcia struck out Machado and Travis Snider to escape a first-and-third, one-out jam in the seventh that followed a throwing error by second baseman Chase Utley. Snider struck out four times swinging and has fanned in five straight at-bats, going back to Wednesday.	Ken Giles tossed a scoreless eighth and Papelbon finished for his 13th save in 13 tries.	Howard hit his 12th homer, connecting on a 1-2 pitch from starter Bud Norris (2-5) to put Philadelphia ahead for the first time in its four-game, home-and-home series against Baltimore.	The Orioles outscored the Phillies 29-7 in three wins.	Norris allowed two runs and five hits in six innings. O'Sullivan struck out a career-high seven in five innings, allowing one run and four hits.	"We had some good swings, but we were just hitting the ball to the wrong parts of the park," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.	DYNAMIC DUO	The Phillies have won 26 straight games that Giles and Papelbon entered with a lead. They are 30-1 in such situations since Giles made his debut on June 12, 2014.	STREAKING	Orioles shortstop J.J. Hardy has an 11-game hitting streak in which he's batting .390 (16 for 41).	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: OF Adam Jones (shoulder) missed his third straight game.	Phillies: Hamels will miss Friday's start against St. Louis because of a mild, right hamstring strain. Righty Phillippe Aumont will be recalled from Triple-A Lehigh Valley to take his place.	UP NEXT	Orioles: RHP Mike Wright (2-2, 4.13) makes his sixth career start in the opener of a three-game series in Toronto. After not allowing a run in 14 1/3 innings in his first two outings, he has given up 13 runs in 14 innings over his last three starts.	Phillies: Aumont will make his first career start when St. Louis visits to start a three-game series Friday night. He started 10 games in the minors this season, going 3-4 with a 2.55 ERA. He was 1-5 with a 6.13 ERA in 45 relief appearances for Philadelphia from 2012-14.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

MINNEAPOLIS --  The Minnesota Twins have been struggling to score this month, with Joe Mauer and Kennys Vargas at the top of the slump list.	Well, guess who hit the home runs to tie and win the game in the last two innings?	Vargas hit a solo shot with two outs in the bottom of the ninth Thursday, lifting the Twins to a 2-1 victory and a two-game sweep of the St. Louis Cardinals.	"It's always fun to get out there and jump around," said Mauer, who went deep in the eighth to answer Jason Heyward's solo shot for the Cardinals in the seventh.	Arriving at home on the first game-ending hit of his career at any level, Vargas was showered with water and a bucket of bubble gum in celebration. He grounded into two double plays, ruining a bases-loaded rally on one of those with one out in the seventh inning, and he's only 5 for 27 since being recalled from Triple-A Rochester.	Before the game, Twins manager Paul Molitor pulled Vargas aside by the batting cage and encouraged him to refocus on having fun.	"You hope it takes some of the weight off that he's been carrying," Molitor said.	It sailed into the right-field seats on a slow 1-1 curveball from Carlos Villanueva (3-2).	"It's, for me, something special that I'm going to remember all my life," Vargas said.	Villanueva said he tried to throw the pitch on the outside of the plate so Vargas would chase it.	"The ball came back over the middle," Villanueva said.	St. Louis lost for the first time in 35 games this year when leading after seven innings.	"It was just challenge time at that point, and their guy came out on top," Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said.	Minnesota won for the first time in 25 games this season when trailing after seven innings. For Mauer, this was his third home run of the season, all of which have tied the game or given the Twins the lead. The three-time batting champion's once-sparkling average had fallen to .250 before he took Kevin Siegrist deep.	"I try to make `em count when I do hit `em," Mauer said.	The six-time All-Star said his swing hasn't "felt that bad" the last couple of weeks. Hitting one into the left-field seats was one way to beat those shifts.	"Nobody can catch a ball out there," Mauer said.	Blaine Boyer (2-2) pitched the ninth for the victory, after eight dominant innings by Mike Pelfrey in an old-fashioned duel with Jaime Garcia.	St. Louis still has baseball's best record by a comfortable margin, but the lineup has slumped lately with only 11 runs in the last five games. The Cardinals were shut out in three of Garcia's first five starts since returning from surgery last summer to alleviate numbness and tingling in his left arm and hand.	Garcia pitched into the seventh, allowing four hits and two walks while striking out four and lowering his ERA to 1.76. Seth Maness bailed him out in the seventh after a walk and a single to start the inning, getting Vargas to ground weakly to shortstop for the double play.	PELFREY'S REBOUND	Pelfrey bounced back authoritatively from his worst start of the season, when he allowed 11 hits and eight runs over 3 2/3 innings at Texas. He gave up four hits and one walk while striking out three, the home run by Heyward the only blemish.	"For it to be 0-0 before that, it made it a little bit frustrating, but overall I thought it was a lot better," Pelfrey said.	Pelfrey got Heyward to ground into a double play earlier on the same count and pitch as the home run, matching teammate Kyle Gibson for the major league lead in groundball double plays induced with 16. Pelfrey lowered his ERA to 2.97.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: RHP Lance Lynn (strained forearm) has been playing catch, but Matheny hasn't reached the point of seeking daily updates, a sign that Lynn still has a ways to go. "He's just progressing nicely," Matheny said.	Twins: RHP Ervin Santana, serving an 80-game suspension for a positive test for a performance-enhancing substance, will make three rehabilitation starts for Triple-A Rochester beginning on Saturday. "If all goes well, we'll have a decision to make," general manager Terry Ryan said.	UP NEXT	Cardinals: The Cardinals continue their road trip in Philadelphia on Friday, with Tyler Lyons starting opposite Cole Hamels of the Phillies.	Twins: The Twins host the Chicago Cubs on Friday, with Phil Hughes taking the mound against Kyle Hendricks.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DENVER --  Domingo Santana couldn't even feel his feet touch the dirt as he strolled around the bases following his first big league homer.	Another clutch hit from a recent call-up. The pipeline of promising prospects just doesn't seem to end for the Houston Astros these days.	Preston Tucker homered and drove in three runs, Santana came through in a pinch-hitting role in the eighth and the Astros beat the Colorado Rockies 8-4 Thursday for their fifth straight win.	With that, Houston became the first team in the American League to win 40 games this season. Know what that means to manager A.J. Hinch?	"That we're winning a lot of games," Hinch said. "But we need plenty more. It's a long season."	Santana was recalled from Triple-A Fresno this week when Colby Rasmus went on the bereavement list following the death of his grandmother. Santana lined a hanging slider from Scott Oberg into the bullpen for a three-run homer, giving the Astros an 8-3 lead.	"It was emotional," Santana said of his first homer in the majors. "Pretty excited."	Their young squad keeps coming up big, especially at the top of the order. Leadoff hitter George Springer extended his hitting streak to 11 games as the Astros swept the four-game, home-and-home series with the reeling Rockies. Hitting right behind Springer, Carlos Correa stole three bases and then, in the No. 3 hole, Tucker came through time and again, including a homer in the first and a double in the fifth that scored the go-ahead run.	Cleanup hitter Chris Carter also drove in two runs as Houston improved to 8-1 in interleague play this season after going 5-15 a year ago.	"It never ceases to amaze me with this team," Hinch said. "Different contributions all the way through."	Collin McHugh (7-3) surrendered a three-run homer to Carlos Gonzalez in the first inning. After that, the right-hander was virtually unsolvable.	McHugh treated himself to an early birthday present by getting the win after allowing three runs, four hits and a season-high five walks in six innings. McHugh, who turns 28 on Friday, only surrendered two hits after Gonzalez's homer.	"I told him after his outing, `If I would've told you 2 1-2 hours ago that you were going to go six strong innings, you wouldn't have believed me," Hinch said.	David Hale (2-2) allowed a season-high five runs in five innings and struck out nine. Rockies pitchers struck out 17 batters, a Colorado record for a nine-inning game.	"That club's a bit of an enigma," manager Walt Weiss said of the Astros. "They have a lot of power, a lot of athleticism, a lot of swing and miss. They have a real good bullpen and starting pitching. That's why they win games."	Another home loss for the Rockies, who are now 13-20 at Coors Field.	"For us to be a good team we have to win at home," Troy Tulowitzki said.	LET'S MAKE A DEAL	The Rockies signed two more of their draft picks Thursday, agreeing to deals with right-hander Mike Nikorak (27th overall pick) and infielder Tyler Nevin (38th). Nevin is the son of former major league infielder Phil Nevin, who was selected as the No. 1 overall pick by Houston in 1992.	Nikorak and Nevin will report to Grand Junction, the organization's rookie-level squad. Nikorak agreed to a $2.3 million bonus. The value assigned to his slot was $2,004,600.	DOWN AN UMP	Third base umpire Bob Davidson left in the third inning due to dehydration. The 62-year-old Davidson lives in Colorado.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: 2B Jose Altuve (hamstring) wasn't in the starting lineup as he goes through treatment. "He doesn't feel a lot of discomfort, which is an encouraging sign," Hinch said. "We'll be very careful with him." ... Rasmus could be back with Houston on Saturday. ... OF Jake Marisnick left the game in the eighth with left hamstring discomfort. "I'm not sure how he's going to be," Hinch said.	Rockies: RHP Brooks Brown was placed on the DL for a second time this season with shoulder inflammation. ... Weiss said there's no timetable yet for 1B Justin Morneau (concussion symptoms) to return.	UP NEXT	Astros: RHP Lance McCullers (3-1, 2.00) makes his seventh big league start when the Astros begin a three-game series Friday in Seattle.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  Pat Murphy didn't have much time to ponder his first win as the San Diego Padres manager before he was grabbed by players, carried into the shower and doused with a combination of beer, champagne and baby powder.	"I thought I was having a heart attack, I'm not joking," Murphy said following Thursday's 3-1 win over the Oakland Athletics. "The thought went through my head, `Isn't this beautiful? You get your first major league win and you have a heart attack in the shower during the celebration.' That's truly what I was thinking."	Murphy was in much better spirits afterward, and for good reason.	San Diego ended a four-game losing streak with solid starting pitching and home runs by Matt Kemp and former A's catcher Derek Norris. That was big for a ballclub just a few days removed from the firing of manager Bud Black on Monday.	"It's a little silly to make it about me today," said Murphy, who was hired Tuesday. "It was kind of a must-win, but you still have to let the game flow. If you try to force it, a lot of bad stuff can happen."	Norris homered against his former team, and Kemp hit his second home run in three days.	Ian Kennedy (4-5) gave up one run and four hits in six innings, allowing only one runner past second base. Kennedy, who struck out Stephen Vogt with the potential tying run at the third in the sixth, has a 2.63 ERA in his last four starts after compiling a 7.15 ERA in his first eight.	"I was glad to be the guy. I've faced him so many times in college, at least I was that guy to be on the mound that day," said Kennedy, whose Southern Cal teams faced Murphy's Arizona State squads. "I wanted to pitch well for him, and partially for the team, too. We needed that one."	Craig Kimbrel pitched a one-hit ninth for his 17th save in 18 chances, completing a five-hitter.	Oakland rookie Kendall Graveman (3-4) allowed two runs and five hits in seven innings, struck out six and walked one.	"He was spotting up his fastball away, his sinker and once they kind of caught on that he was throwing those for strikes, they started to swing a little more," catcher Josh Phegley said. "It was just couple pitches up in the zone that we got beat on."	San Diego struck out eight times, raising its total in four games against Oakland this week to 40.	Oakland right fielder Josh Reddick went down hard after colliding with center fielder Billy Burns while chasing Melvin Upton's triple in the eighth. Reddick -- who appeared to get hit in the face by Burns' gloved hand and absorbed a knee to the groin -- lay on the warning track for several moments as manager Bob Melvin and a team trainer rushed out from the dugout. Reddick remained in the game.	A day after setting season-highs for runs (16) and hits (20), Oakland couldn't get much going.	Kemp homered in the fourth and Norris doubled the lead when he homered leading off the sixth. He had been hitless in six at-bats at the Coliseum since he was traded to San Diego in December.	Phegley homered in the sixth for Oakland, which had won four games in a row.	Melvin Upton Jr. tripled and scored on brother Justin Upton's sacrifice fly into foul territory in the eighth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: Infielder Will Middlebrooks was kept out of the starting lineup while Norris made his first career start at first base. Yonder Alonso, San Diego's normal starting first baseman, got the start at third. ... Middlebrooks struck out as a pinch hitter in the seventh.	Athletics: 1B Ike Davis (strained left quadriceps) played for Triple-A Nashville on Wednesday and is expected to be activated from the disabled list as early as Friday.	UP NEXT	Padres: RHP James Shields (7-0) pitches the series opener in Arizona on Friday and is third in the NL in strikeouts. Shields has fanned six or more in all but two of his 14 starts this season.	Athletics: RHP Sonny Gray (8-3) takes his major league-low 1.60 ERA into Friday's start against the Angels.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

PHOENIX --  The Los Angeles Angels got another strong start from C.J. Wilson and offense from someone other than Mike Trout or Albert Pujols.	Thursday was the kind of day that makes manager Mike Scioscia feel good about the coming weeks.	Wilson struck out a season-high nine in his second straight strong outing, Taylor Featherston hit his first major league home run and the Angels beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 7-1 to split the four-game interleague series.	The first two games were played in Anaheim, the last two in Phoenix.	Wilson (5-5), after throwing seven scoreless innings in his previous start, gave up one run and scattered eight hits in eight innings. The left-hander didn't walk anyone.	Scioscia's only criticism was Wilson's head-first slide when the pitcher tried to stretch a single into a double but was tagged out on a throw from right fielder Yasmany Tomas.	"Those kinds of slides are the slides that end careers if it's on the wrong side," Scioscia said.	But, the manager said, Wilson was "athletic enough to pull it off."	Wilson made no apologies.	"He made a perfect throw and I was out," he said. "I tried to do like a Mike Trout turbo slide but he nicked me on the elbow."	Wilson said he loves to play all aspects of the game, including hitting and baserunning.	"If you're a bad athlete, then you're not going to try something like that," he said. "I'm just going to say I'm a good athlete so every time I get on base I'm either going to try to advance on a groundball or a wild pitch or break up a double play. It's the way I've always played."	Featherston and Johnny Giavotella each hit solo homers in the third off Allen Webster (1-1), making his second big league start.	Arizona's Paul Goldschmidt was 0 for 4 and struck out three times, failing to reach base for the first time in 28 games. It had been the longest active streak in the majors.	"You look at his numbers. He's hitting .360 with a .500 on-base percentage," Wilson said. "I was I guess fortunate to have really good run support today so I had a chance to challenge him. He wants to hit, he's a great hitter. I got him to chase a couple of pitches today. I don't think he's going to do that very often."	Carlos Perez had a two-run double and Efren Navarro a two-run single in the Angels' five-run sixth inning. Trout tripled in the inning's other run.	Webster was rocked for six runs on five hits and walked five, one intentional, in 5 1/3 innings. He left with the bases loaded and one out in the sixth. Josh Collmenter, who lost his rotation spot to Webster, came in and gave up the big hits to Navarro and Perez.	For the eighth time since they were 8-8 on April 24, the Diamondbacks failed in a bid to reach .500.	"I don't think anybody is thinking about that," manager Chip Hale said. "We just didn't play well enough today and they did. It's just the way it goes. You get beat some days."	Arizona had cut the Los Angeles lead to 2-1 with consecutive doubles by David Peralta and Nick Ahmed in the fifth.	Featherston, who entered the game hitting .083 in 36 at-bats, lined an 0-1 pitch into the left field seats.	"I had my head down and was thinking extra bases," he said, "and I looked up and the umpire raised his finger and starts doing the little twirly. You know you're getting into the trot. I'm just very thankful and blessed. It was a good day."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: RHP Cory Rasmus, on the 60-day DL and yet to play this season after undergoing abdominal surgery, begins a rehab assignment this week.	Diamondbacks: RHP Archie Bradley (shoulder tendinitis) pitched a simulated game on Thursday.	UP NEXT	Angels: Los Angeles opens a three-game series in Oakland on Friday night, starting Matt Shoemaker (4-5, 4.85 ERA) vs. RHP Sonny Gray (8-3, 1.60), the major league ERA leader.	Diamondbacks: The five-game homestand continues with the series opener against San Diego on Friday, Arizona's first game against the Padres since Pat Murphy, former coach at Arizona State, became their interim manager. Arizona goes with RHP Rubby De La Rosa (5-3, 5.27), who tossed eight scoreless innings in his last start. The Diamondbacks try to hand RHP James Shields (7-0, 3.59) his first loss of the season.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK -- On the brink of another major milestone during a surprisingly successful comeback season, Alex Rodriguez stood on first base and soaked in the adulation of an adoring crowd.	A-Rod certainly didn't expect it to be this good.	Rodriguez reached 2,999 hits with a pair of singles, and Carlos Beltran and Brett Gardner each had two-run homers, leading the New York Yankees to a 9-4 victory over the Miami Marlins on Thursday night.	"I don't even know how to describe it. It feels great," Rodriguez said. "Every time moments like that happen, I can just reflect on a year ago today."	Sixty-six games into his return from a yearlong drug suspension, Rodriguez hit an RBI single in the first inning for the second straight night, flied out to right field in the third and hit a sharp grounder past diving third baseman Donovan Solano in the fifth to move within one hit of becoming the 29th player to reach the 3,000 plateau.	He lined out in the sixth, his first try at joining the elite club -- swinging at specially marked balls.	Yankee Stadium speakers blared with a piece of Beethoven's famed Symphony No. 5 as Rodriguez came to bat in the eighth with nearly all of the 38,239 cheering fans rising to their feet, camera phones flashing.	"The fans just want to see the players do well, that's the bottom line, and he has done well," manager Joe Girardi said in explaining the support for Rodriguez. "Sometimes people pull for people to fight back and get back up, when they've been knocked down."	Miami reliever Sam Dyson didn't give A-Rod a chance to swing, throwing four inside pitches that sent the slugger leaping back each time.	"I threw him four fastballs inside. That was the sequence," Dyson said. "If he was gonna beat me he was gonna have to get the head out. I ended up throwing four balls kind of at his belt, not the plate."	The boos got louder with each pitch and turned to vulgar chants aimed at Dyson that lasted until he was lifted three batters later, following Chris Young's RBI double.	"It is what it is," Dyson said of the jeers. "I tried beating him with my best stuff."	The Yankees made every effort to get Rodriguez one more shot at the milestone, sending six men to the plate after his walk. Brian McCann had an RBI single and Stephen Drew added a sacrifice fly in the inning.	Gardner's longball chased Mat Latos in the sixth to tie it at 3, and Beltran, who was booed when he popped out to end the sixth, put New York ahead with a drive to left an inning later off reliever Mike Dunn (1-4) and rounded the bases to loud applause.	CC Sabathia gave up three runs in six effective innings, allowing Giancarlo Stanton's major league-leading 25th homer, as the Yankees won for their ninth time in their last 10 home games.	"It's hard for me. It's difficult not being the guy I used to be, going deep in the games," Sabathia said. " I just go out there as hard as I can until I'm done."	Chasen Shreve (4-1) gave up a hit in one inning for the win.	With A-Rod in the lineup as the designated hitter, the Yankees won the final two games of a four-game, home-and-home series that began in Miami. The three-time MVP was limited to one pinch-hit at-bat in two losses at the NL ballpark.	A night after being no-hit into the seventh by Michael Pineda, Gordon tripled for Miami's first hit off Sabathia leading off the seventh. He scored on Christian Yelich's groundout to tie it 1-all.	The Marlins then went ahead in the fifth on Jeff Mathis' sacrifice fly. Stanton's homer to left field in the sixth made it 3-1.	Stanton has 13 homers in his last 23 games.	"It just shows you how special he truly is," Marlins manager Dan Jennings said. "On any given swing he can leave the ballpark. We're watching him become more of a complete hitter."	In his second start since coming off the disabled, Latos gave up nine hits and three runs in 5 2/3 innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: INF Martin Prado (right shoulder) was put on the DL, retroactive to June 15. Jennings said Prado worked out in Florida, but is still too sore.	Yankees: CF Jacoby Ellsbury (knee) ran from first to third several times during batting practice. It was first thought that Ellsbury would go to the Yankees' complex in Florida for rehab after the series in Miami, but he returned to New York with the team. Girardi said it was not a setback.	A HALL OF A BAT	Baseball's Hall of Fame said A-Rod has donated the bat he used to get his 2,000th RBI, on Saturday in Baltimore. The bat will be displayed in the Today's Game exhibit.	UP NEXT	Marlins: RHP Dan Haren (6-3) faces the Reds. He has struggled at Great American Ballpark in Cincinnati, with a 5.59 ERA in six games, five starts.	Yankees: RHP Adam Warren (4-4) starts against the Detroit Tigers. Warren has a 2.81 ERA in his four losses.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

WASHINGTON --  As Nationals star Bryce Harper took an awkward tumble in the wet outfield Thursday night, he felt something few associate with the brawny slugger:	Fear.	Harper might have escaped a serious injury, straining his left hamstring while making a throw in Washington's 5-3 loss to the Tampa Bay Rays.	But with immense talent and injury ridden past, even Harper had trouble keeping calm.	"I've had problems with my left knee before -- I've had surgery on it," Harper said. "So you know, it was definitely really scary."	Manager Matt Williams said Harper had a mild strain and would be evaluated Friday. He gave no estimate on how long Harper might be out or whether he would need to go on the disabled list, though Harper indicated he may be day-to-day.	"Be smart about it, of course," Harper said. "I want to be in there, but if I don't feel right tomorrow, then maybe taking that day off might help me a little bit."	Harper is hitting .344 with 22 home runs and 52 RBI. A two-time All-Star at 22, he has dealt several lower body injuries through his career, and had surgery on his left knee after the 2013 season for a bursa sac. Harper also missed roughly a third of last season with a thumb ligament injury.	A prolonged absence would add to the injury difficulties for the Nationals, who lost three of four to the AL East-leading Rays to fall to one game above .500.	Doug Fister (2-3) came back from a month out with forearm tightness Thursday, but allowed five runs in 5 1/3 innings. Starter Stephen Strasburg (neck tightness) could potentially return to the team after his next bullpen session.	Outfielder Jayson Werth is aiming for an Aug. 1 return from a left wrist contusion, and infielder Ryan Zimmerman went on the disabled list last week with plantar fasciitis in his left foot.	"It's time to step up. Everybody," Williams said. "We look forward to doing that tomorrow."	Harper fell on the damp grass while trying to throw home on Asdrubal Cabrera's single in the sixth inning. As he planted to throw, his right leg slipped and his left leg buckled.	Harper held his left leg while down on the ground for a few minutes and then gingerly walked off the field under his own power, escorted by members of the Nationals' training staff.	Harper's throw went wildly into the dugout during a four-run inning for Tampa Bay. There had been a 17-minute rain delay in the fourth.	"That wet surface played a big part in that, and it's a bummer it happened," Harper said.	Said Williams: "Conditions are conditions."	Joey Butler homered and pinch-hitter David DeJesus had a two-run triple for the AL East-leading Rays.	Chris Archer (8-4) won his fifth straight decision despite allowing three runs on a season-high eight hits in five innings. Brad Boxberger pitched the ninth for his 16th save.	"I think taking three of four from anybody is big," said Rays manager Kevin Cash. "We were fortunate to come out of here with three wins."	Yunel Escobar got five hits for the Nationals for the third time this season.	REUNITED	Rays outfielder Steven Souza Jr. joined Nationals starter Jordan Zimmermann on the field pregame to accept the 2014 award for the the defensive play of the year from MLB.com. Last year with the Nationals, Souza's diving catch completed Zimmermann's no-hitter against the Miami Marlins on the final day of the regular season.	TRAINER'S ROOM:	Rays: Pregame rain prevented OF John Jaso (left wrist contusion) from taking on-field batting practice for the first time this season. "We wanted him out there and it didn't work out," Cash said. "He'll probably go ahead and take 500 swings now in the cage."	Nationals: Strasburg (neck tightness) was throwing on the field the day after a rehab start, and will throw a bullpen in the next couple days. . RHP Aaron Barrett (bicep strain) hasn't returned to throwing after going on the DL last Friday, Williams said.	UP NEXT:	Rays: A five-game road trip continues when RHP Nathan Karns (3-3, 3.67) faces Cleveland RHP Carlos Carrasco (8-5, 4.38)	Nationals: 22-year-old rookie RHP Joe Ross (1-1, 3.46) gets his third career start against Pittsburgh Pirates RHP A.J. Burnett, who will be making career start No. 418.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

TORONTO --  Youth was served in a battle of aging pitchers, giving R.A. Dickey his first victory in five starts.	The 40-year-old Dickey pitched into the eighth inning to earn the win against his former team, Chris Colabello hit a solo homer and the Toronto Blue Jays beat the New York Mets 7-1 on Thursday night.	Dickey beat 42-year-old Bartolo Colon (9-5) in the first matchup between two starting pitchers in their 40s since Aug. 15, 2008, when Philadelphia's Jamie Moyer (45) beat San Diego's Greg Maddux (42).	"I was happy that the young buck won tonight," Dickey joked.	Jose Bautista drove in two runs as the Blue Jays, who lost back-to-back games at Citi Field earlier this week, swept two against the visiting Mets. Toronto is 13-3 in June and has won eight straight at home.	Dickey (3-6) allowed one run on three hits and overcame five walks for his first victory since May 21.	"He gutted it out," Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. "He was determined."	The knuckleballer, who won the NL Cy Young with the Mets in 2012, didn't give up a hit until Juan Lagares' two-out double in the fifth. He left after Lucas Duda's one-out homer in the eighth.	"His ball was dancing a lot today," said Mets catcher Travis d'Arnaud, one of the players acquired in the November 2012, trade that sent Dickey to Toronto.	The Mets dropped to 10-21 on the road, and lost for the 13th time in their past 16 away from home.	"We're playing a little sluggishly right now," Mets manager Terry Collins said. "We need to find some energy."	The only active major leaguer who played for the Montreal Expos, Colon got roughed up in his return to Canada, giving up seven runs -- six earned -- and nine hits in 4 1/3 innings, matching his shortest start of the season.	Kevin Pillar opened the scoring with an RBI single in the second, then broke up a potential double play on Ryan Goins' RBI grounder to prolong Toronto's five-run fourth. Jose Reyes singled home a run, Josh Donaldson hit an RBI double and Bautista capped the rally with a two-run single.	"It was just that one inning that they capitalized on some mistakes," d'Arnaud said of Colon. "Other than that, he got the outs."	Colabello made it 7-0 with a leadoff drive to right in the fifth.	Duda's 10th home run snapped New York's scoreless streak at 21 innings.	SANCHEZ STILL SHELVED	Blue Jays RHP Aaron Sanchez (strained back muscle) will miss his third straight start Sunday, with RHP Scott Copeland continuing to take Sanchez's place. Sanchez, who last started June 5 and has yet to resume throwing, is likely to need a minor league rehab stint before rejoining the rotation.	DECISION TIME	Colon has received a decision in 26 consecutive starts, a Mets record. Dwight Gooden had a decision in 25 straight from June 2, 1993, to June 24, 1994.	SIGNING DAY	The Mets signed their top two selections from last week's draft. OF Desmond Linday was picked in the second round, 53rd overall, while LHP Max Wotell went in the third round, 88th overall.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: Collins said Kevin Plawecki will start at catcher Friday to give d'Arnaud a day off. D'Arnaud missed more than six weeks with a broken finger earlier this season.	Blue Jays: 1B Edwin Encarnacion got the day off. ... 2B Maicer Izturis is expected miss the rest of the season after having right shoulder surgery Tuesday.	UP NEXT	Mets: RHP Jacob deGrom (7-4, 2.33) gets the start as New York opens a three-game series in Atlanta on Friday. DeGrom is 4-0 with a 1.25 ERA in his past six starts. The Braves had yet to name a starter.	Blue Jays: RHP Marco Estrada (4-3, 4.24) starts the opener of a three-game series against Baltimore. RHP Mike Wright (2-2, 4.13) will pitch for the Orioles. After going winless in his first five starts, Estrada has won the past three.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CLEVELAND --  Cody Allen didn't get credit for a win or a save Thursday night. He did record the biggest out of the Cleveland Indians' 4-3 victory over the Chicago Cubs.	Following a rain delay of 1 hour and 16 minutes in the fifth inning, Indians manager Terry Francona went with his closer to work out of a bases-loaded jam and the score tied 3-all.	Francona's move paid off and the Indians bounced back from Wednesday's 17-0 drubbing.	Rookie Giovanny Urshela's seventh-inning single drove in the go-ahead run for the Indians and Zach McAllister (2-2) pitched 1 1/3 innings while Bryan Shaw recorded the final four outs for his first save.	Rookie Kyle Schwarber's two-run homer off Danny Salazar tied the game in the fifth.   The Cubs then loaded the bases only to have the game delayed again. During the delay, Francona decided to go with Allen, who retired Miguel Montero on a fly ball and pitched a scoreless sixth.	Francona had a simple explanation for the unorthodox strategy.	"I'd rather lose with our best in a situation when the game's leveraged," he said. "I would have been upset if we lost late, but if we had given them some runs earlier I would have been more upset."	Allen was all for it when Francona approached him during the delay.	"He asked me if I was open to it and I said `Absolutely," Allen said. "It's a big spot in the game, but whether that out is in the ninth inning or the fifth inning, there's a point where the game can be won or lost and he felt it was that point."	"He was damn excited and I got excited," Francona said.	Cubs manager Joe Maddon said of Francona's decision, "It's interesting. Thought it was fine. Just didn't do anything after that. Just a matter of what he felt among his guys. It was primarily based on the moment."	The game started 25 minutes late and the two delays totaled 1:41.	The Indians survived another big night from Schwarber, who had two hits and is 6 for 10 with four RBI in three games since being called up Tuesday.	Yan Gomes started the winning rally with a single off Travis Wood (3-3). Michael Bourn singled before Urshela's hit off Justin Grimm scored Gomes.	"It feels great," said Urshela, who was called up from Triple-A Columbus on June 9. "I'm trying to help the team win. I wasn't trying to do too much there."	Cleveland scored twice in the first inning off Jason Hammel on Michael Brantley's RBI double and Montero's passed ball. The Cubs scored in the third on a throwing error by rookie shortstop Francisco Lindor. Gomes' sacrifice fly added a run.	Francona used seven pitchers to get through the eighth inning Wednesday, forcing him to go with outfielders Ryan Raburn and David Murphy in the ninth when Chicago scored seven times.	Kris Bryant, who hit a grand slam off Murphy on Wednesday, extended his hitting streak to 14 games.	Bourn was in the lineup as he appeals his one-game suspension for making contact with umpire Phil Cuzzi in Tuesday's game at Wrigley Field.	Gomes left the game in the eighth with neck tightness.	Salazar allowed three runs in 4 2/3 innings. Hammel gave up three runs in four innings.	PITCHING SHUFFLE	After designating pitcher Shaun Marcum for assignment, the Indians need a starter for Sunday against Tampa Bay. RHP Cody Anderson or LHP Mike Roth, who are both pitching in the minors, are the main candidates. Veteran RHP Jhoulys Chacin was pitching at Triple-A Columbus, but opted out of his contract to become a free agent.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: Montero returned after missing Wednesday's game with a stiff back.	Indians: Francona said Raburn's right arm was a "little sore" after throwing 25 pitches Wednesday, but added the outfielder was fine.	UP NEXT	Cubs: RHP Kyle Hendricks will open a three-game series in Minnesota on Friday night. He will make his first career start against the Twins.	Indians:  RHP Carlos Carrasco goes for his career-high ninth win Friday night when he starts against Tampa Bay.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ATLANTA --  A strange day ended with a much-needed victory for the struggling Boston Red Sox.	Hours after benching third baseman Pablo Sandoval for using his Instagram account during a loss to Atlanta the night before, the Red Sox bounced back for its second win in 10 games, 5-2 over the Braves on Thursday.	The win came thanks in part to a dropped popup and a 10-pitch at-bat by starting pitcher Clay Buchholz that ended with a strikeout.	"Regardless of what has gone on, a win is always a good thing," manager John Farrell said after his team split a four-game, two-city series with the Braves. "We need as many as we can get, obviously. "	Buchholz (4-6) threw seven strong innings and Koji Uehara earned his 14th save. Buchholz gave up two unearned runs and struck out three.	But it was an at-bat by Buchholz, a pitcher in the league that uses the designated hitter, that may have set the stage for the key Red Sox rally as he forced extra pitches from Braves starter Shelby Miller in the fifth inning on a hot, humid night.	"Facing another pitcher, all you want to do is throw strikes," Buchholz said. "Sometimes it's hard to do that. I was able to get into a full count and foul some good pitches off. Some of those pitches, actual hitters probably would have been mad at themselves for fouling off."	While Miller got the strikeout, he ended up giving up five hits and three runs the following inning to put the Braves in a 4-0 hole.	"That's probably the toughest at-bat I had all game," Miller said. "For an American League pitcher, he did pretty well up there."	Miller ran into some bad luck as well in the sixth when third baseman Juan Uribe dropped a routine foul popup from Mookie Betts about 15 feet from home plate. Betts singled two pitches later, then David Ortiz singled to load the bases with no outs.	A run scored on Hanley Ramirez's double-play grounder, Xander Bogaerts hit an RBI single and Alejandro De Aza finished Miller's night with a run-scoring double.	Brock Holt had two hits and a walk, scored three times and made a diving stop on a grounder at second base in the seventh when Atlanta had two runners on base. Holt has reached base in 13 straight games.	"I've been saying it since Day One -- he is a huge pick up for us," Buchholz said of Holt. "He can play a lot of positions, he can hit, he has power. He's not just a bench player. He's been a big asset to this club."	The Braves scored two unearned runs in the sixth when A.J. Pierzynski hit a line drive off Buchholz's glove with the bases loaded. Buchholz scrambled after the ball, then overthrew Ortiz at first by trying to throw the ball with his glove hand. Cameron Maybin and Nick Markakis scored on the play.	The start of the game was delayed 45 minutes because of rain.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: 2B Dustin Pedroia sat out with inflammation in his left knee. He has missed two of the last three games. Farrell said it was a day-to-day situation and the Red Sox are not considering the DL yet. ... RHP Heith Hembree was placed on the 15-day DL with shoulder inflammation retroactive to June 15. Hembree had an 8.53 ERA in four relief appearances this season.	Braves: 1B Freddie Freeman missed his first game since Sept. 24, 2013, with a sprained right wrist, ending a streak of 234 straight games -- it had been the longest active streak in the majors. ... SS Andrelton Simmons returned to the lineup after missing Wednesday's game with a sore hand.	UP NEXT	Red Sox: Rookie Eduardo Rodriguez will look to bounce back from a rough start as the Red Sox open a three-game series at Kansas City. Rodriguez (2-1, 3.55 ERA) allowed nine runs in his third career start on June 14 after consecutive stellar outings to begin his career. He will be opposed by Yohan Pino, who is expected to be recalled from Triple-A Omaha and make his first start for the Royals.	Braves: The Braves will open a three-game series at home against the NL East-leading Mets. Jacob deGrom (7-4, 2.33 ERA) will start for New York. Top prospect Matt Wisler will make is Major League debut for the Braves in place of Mike Foltynewicz, who was sent to Triple-A Gwinnet on Wednesday.	RECORD-BREAKER	Markakis played his 393rd straight game in the outfield without an error, setting the all-time MLB record for consecutive errorless games by an outfielder. He surpassed Darren Lewis, who set the previous mark from 1990-94.	ORTIZ GRABS HIS GLOVE	Ortiz started at first base with no designated hitter in the National League park. Since 2003, the Red Sox are 46-20 with Ortiz starting in such situations and 21-28 when he does not. He has played 27 straight error-less games as a first baseman. He was removed in the seventh inning for a pinch-runner.	SUBBING FOR SANDOVAL	Rookie Travis Shaw filled in nicely at third base for Sandoval, throwing out Simmons after going to his knees to make a play in the fifth inning. Shaw was 0 for 4 and is still looking for his first major league hit.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

CHICAGO --  Gerrit Cole downplayed becoming the majors' first 11-game winner by crediting his Pittsburgh Pirates teammates for his terrific start.	Cole allowed two runs and three hits in seven innings and the Pirates beat the struggling Chicago White Sox 3-2 on Thursday night to extend their winning streak to a season-high eight games.	"It's a testament to how well we've played when I take the mound," Cole said. "It's more of a team stat than an individual stat."	Win No. 11 was certainly a team effort.	Cole (11-2) has won each of his last six starts, but it looked as if he would receive a no-decision after the White Sox rallied to tie the score at two in the bottom of the seventh inning.	The Pirates, though, answered with a run in the top of the eighth -- Jung Ho Kang scored on an infield groundout by Gregory Polanco -- to put Cole on the plus-side again.	"That's huge," Cole said. "It shows we're grinding out at-bats and we're staying ready every pitch."	Kang went 2-for-5 with an RBI and the run scored, and Josh Harrison and Polanco each drove in a run for Pittsburgh. The Pirates, who also won 3-2 Wednesday, have won seven times in their last 11 games while scoring three runs or less. Manager Clint Hurdle said that statistic shows how well they've pitched during that stretch.	"The length has been so good from the starters and the run totals have been small," Hurdle said. "The bullpen has come in and closed things down. There's no question the pitching has been the strength of everything we're doing."	Geovany Soto hit a solo home run for Chicago, which has dropped a season-high seven games.	Jake Petricka (1-2) took the loss in relief of starter Jeff Samardzija, who allowed two runs and 10 hits in seven innings and remained winless in his last five starts.	"I wanted to come out there and have a good strong outing and give our team a chance to win," Samardzija said. "Unfortunately, it didn't turn out that way, but we fought out there, played tough and we were going against a pretty darn good pitcher in Cole."	The Pirates took a 1-0 lead in the fourth inning on an infield single by Kang that scored Starling Marte from third base. But the White Sox tied it in the bottom half of the inning. Jose Abreu led off with a little flare down the right-field line for a double, advanced to third on a fly ball to deep center by Adam LaRoche and scored on a sacrifice fly by Melky Cabrera.	Pittsburgh reclaimed the lead in the fifth inning. With one out, Jordy Mercer hit a hard grounder up the middle. Samardzija knocked it down at his feet, but couldn't find it right away and that was long enough for Mercer to leg out the infield hit.	Mercer then went to third on a single to right by Corey Hart and scored on a sacrifice fly to center by Harrison to make it 2-1.	That's where it stayed until the bottom of the seventh when Soto tied the game with a long homer to left-center on a 3-2 pitch. With two outs and none on, Soto connected on a 98 mph fastball from Cole. It was Soto's fourth homer of the season and came on Cole's 103rd pitch.	"For him to be that close to getting out of the inning and giving up the homer, that's baseball," Hurdle said. "Our guys had the wherewithal to pick him up and scratch one back in the eighth inning to go ahead."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: 2B Neil Walker wasn't in the lineup because of a stomach ailment. ... RHP Jameson Taillon, the team's No. 1 pick in the 2010 draft who is coming back from Tommy John surgery, had a five-inning, 74-pitch outing Thursday in extended spring training.	UP NEXT	Pirates: Open a three-game series at Washington on Friday. Veteran RHP A.J. Burnett (6-2, 1.89 ERA), who had a no-decision in his last start despite tossing nine scoreless innings, will be matched against RHP Joe Ross (1-3, 3.46).	White Sox: The homestand continues as Chicago hosts the Texas Rangers for a three-game series over the weekend. LHP Chris Sale (6-3, 3.01 ERA) pitches the opener for the White Sox on Friday night against RHP Colby Lewis (6-3, 4.37 ERA) of the Rangers.

The latest win came Thursday night when Alcides Escobar had three hits and Jeremy Guthrie pitched six effective innings as the Royals beat the Milwaukee Brewers 3-2.	With the victory, Yost surpassed Whitey Herzog as the winningest manager in franchise history with 411 wins. Earlier in the month Yost moved past Dick Howser, who managed the Royals to their only World Series championship in 1985.	"It's nice, but again I don't look at it as an individual achievement," Yost said "First of all, I don't feel like I'm in the same class as Whitey Herzog and Dick Howser, one. Two, this is an organizational-wide achievement and I'm proud to be part of that. Everybody is involved."	Yost said general manager Dayton Moore could have fired him "two or three times, but didn't." Yost has a 411-427 record as Royals manager.	Escobar doubled to lead off the Royals' two-run first then scored on Lorenzo Cain's sacrifice fly. Escobar singled in the second, stole second base and scored on Mike Moustakas' two-out single.	Kendrys Morales' two-out single in the first drove in Eric Hosmer, who had doubled, with the other Royals' run.	Guthrie (5-4) picked up his first victory since May 20, allowing two runs and seven hits, walked none and struck out four.	Relievers Kelvin Herrera, Wade Davis and Greg Holland held the Brewers to one hit over the final three innings.	"I hated taking Jeremy out of that ball game after six, but when you've got a one-run lead and a fresh Herrera, Davis and Holland down there, the decision was easy," Yost said.	Davis pitched out of a bases loaded, one-out jam in the eighth. He retired Adam Lind on a foul popup then struck out Scooter Gennett looking.	Holland, who gave up three runs, four hits and a walk at Milwaukee on Monday, worked the ninth to earn his 12th save in 13 opportunities.	The Brewers got all their runs in the fifth on Gerardo Parra's sacrifice fly and Jonathan Lucroy's two-out RBI single.	Brewers starter Jimmy Nelson (3-8) surrendered three runs and a career-high 11 hits in five innings. In his past two starts, Nelson has allowed 21 hits and 10 runs in 10 innings.	"Right now I'm discouraged because we lost," Nelson said. "I don't care how many hits I give up as long as we win. It's hard to think about anything good right now after a loss."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: CF Carlos Gomez was out of the lineup for the third time in four games with a right groin and hip issue. Manager Craig Counsell said the injury "is not moving forward; it's just the same."	Royals: RHP Yordano Ventura was placed on the DL with right ulnar nerve inflammation. . RHP Kris Medlen, who missed last season after elbow surgery, begins a rehab assignment Friday with a start for Double-A Northwest Arkansas.	UP NEXT	Brewers: RHP Taylor Jungmann, a 2011 first-round draft pick, will make his third big league start Friday at Colorado.	Royals: RHP Yohan Pino, who was 0-1 with a 0.64 ERA in six relief appearances earlier this season, was recalled from Triple-A Omaha and will start against Boston.	STREAKS CONTIUNED	Alex Gordon had two hits and Cain had one as they extended their hitting streaks to nine games. Cain drove in six runs in the series against the Brewers, the team that he broke in with in 2010. Gordon has matched his longest hitting streak in the past two years.	STRUGGLING BRAUN	Brewers RF Ryan Braun has one hit in his past 23 at-bats, dropping his average to .249.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SEATTLE --  Ryan Vogelsong rebounded from a rough outing with his best start in almost a month and the San Francisco Giants bullpen made sure it wasn't wasted.	Vogelsong and three relievers combined on a five-hitter to give San Francisco its major league-leading 11th shutout, a 7-0 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Thursday night.	Staked to an early 3-0 lead, Vogelsong (5-5) allowed three singles over 6 2/3 innings, striking out six and walking two as the offensively challenged Mariners were held to two runs or less for the 26th time in 67 games.	"I just kind of found my tempo, found my rhythm and just started throwing the ball better," Vogelsong said. "Sometimes that first inning can be a little tough, getting used to the mound and trying to find your release point a little bit. So, I just got through that first inning and just kind of got everything going."	Vogelsong's performance was in stark contrast to his last start, when he allowed four runs and six hits with five walks in 3 2/3 innings in a 4-2 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks.	After going 4-0 in five starts in May with a 1.14 ERA, Vogelsong was 0-3 with a 6.61 ERA in his first three starts in June.	"I know Vogie very well," Mariners manager Lloyd McClendon said. "He settled down. We gave him an opportunity to settle down. He started hitting his spots. When he's hitting his spots, he's pretty tough."	San Francisco capitalized on a botched double-play attempt for three second-inning runs off Mike Montgomery (1-2), who allowed four runs and seven hits in 7 1/3 innings.	The Giants loaded the bases with one out on a walk to Brandon Belt and consecutive singles by Andrew Susac and Justin Maxwell.	Joaquin Arias bounced to second baseman Dustin Ackley for what looked like a possible inning-ending double play, but shortstop Brad Miller dropped the ball on the attempted relay after the force at second, allowing Belt to score and sending Susac to third.	Nori Aoki followed with an RBI single and Joe Panik's RBI double made it 3-0.	"It's always nice to have some points on the board," said Vogelsong, whose 6.31 road ERA entering the game was second-worst in the National League. "When you're going out there it gives you a chance to attack the zone a little bit more and do some things that you probably wouldn't try to do in a closer game. So, yeah, that makes a big difference."	The Mariners, who have lost nine of their last 11 at home, chased Vogelsong with consecutive two-out singles in the seventh, but Javier Lopez retired Ackley on a bouncer to first. Including Ackley, left-handed batters are 2 for 37 off Lopez, including 0 for their last 27.	"Obviously when we get the quality start, that sets things into motion, because (manager Bruce) Bochy tries to put all of us in to a position to succeed," Lopez said. "I think when it becomes a match-up game, we do pretty well."	The Giants added four runs in the eighth, keyed by Matt Duffy's two-run triple.	Hunter Strickland walked two Mariners in the eighth, but Cruz lined into an unassisted double play at second to end the inning.	Seth Smith and Mark Trumbo opened the Seattle ninth with consecutive singles off Jeremy Affeldt, but Miller struck out and Willie Bloomquist bounced into another double play.	Montgomery has pitched at least six innings in each of his four career starts, but this was the first time he allowed more than two runs.	"It was just a matter of leaving balls over the plate," Montgomery said of the second inning. "I'd get ahead and not make good pitches when I was ahead. After that inning, I settled down in a little bit, attacked the zone. We made some good plays. I just wanted to keep us in the game and get some outs."	UP NEXT:	Giants: Rookie RHP Chris Heston (6-5) makes his second start since his no-hitter against the Mets to open the three-game series against the Dodgers. In his last start, he gave up three runs -- two earned -- and seven hits in five innings in a 4-0 loss to Arizona.	Mariners: LHP Roenis Elias (3-4) opens the three-series against the Astros and looks to bounce back after allowing eight runs -- seven earned -- and seven hits in 3 1/3 innings in his last start, a 13-0 loss at Houston. Elias has last three of his last four starts, with his ERA climbing from 2.56 to 3.67 over that stretch. He is facing the Astros for the third time this season.	TRAINER'S ROOM:	Giants: OF Gregor Blanco, who has missed eight games with a concussion, is eligible to come off the seven-day DL, but could be ready by Friday, Bochy said. "Hopefully tomorrow in LA. We're going to run him pretty good, run the bases, I think. That's the really the last box he's got to check off."	Mariners: 2B Robinson Cano was a pregame scratch with a stiff lower back.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

LOS ANGELES -- One rookie pulled one of the oldest tricks in the book against another, and it worked out for the Los Angeles Dodgers on Thursday night.	Pinch runner Enrique Hernandez scored on a two-out balk by Texas Rangers reliever Keone Kela in the ninth inning, giving the National League West leaders a 1-0 victory.	"I just tried to do something to distract the pitcher," Hernandez said. "I faked him, and he fell for it."	Kela (4-4), who preserved the Rangers' 5-3 win Wednesday night with his first major league save, walked Yasmani Grandal and Andre Ethier to open the ninth. First baseman Mitch Moreland then turned Alberto Callaspo's grounder into a 3-6-3 double play, but Kela was rattled by Hernandez's bluff toward the plate with a 1-2 count on Jimmy Rollins, and was called for the balk simultaneously by plate umpire Marvin Hudson and first-base ump Jim Joyce.	"I didn't need for them to tell me. We could see it," Rangers manager Jeff Banister said. "You could see (Hernandez's) little fake-break down the line, and you saw the little shoulder turn by Leone. It was a balk. It was very slight, but it was there. We got the double-play ball and were in good shape with two strikes on Rollins, but we just came up a little short tonight."	Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen (2-0) got the victory with a perfect ninth inning.	Los Angeles starter Zack Greinke scattered four hits over seven innings, struck out eight and walked none while lowering his ERA to 1.81. The hard-luck right-hander is 0-2 with a 1.99 ERA in his past eight starts, and the Dodgers have fewer than three runs in six of them -- including Saturday's 2-1 loss at San Diego, when Greinke went the distance for the first time this season.	"There's no reason for him to be frustrated," said Grandal, the Dodgers' catcher. "He's a veteran guy and he's been doing his job. I mean, he can only do so much to keep us in the game. And that's what we're looking for from our starters -- keep us in the game, and we'll find a way to win."	Anthony Ranaudo allowed five hits in 6 2/3 innings, striking out four in his second spot start of the season after getting recalled by Texas earlier in the day from Triple-A Round Rock to give everyone in the rotation an extra day's rest. On April 15, he gave up six runs and six hits in just 1 1/3 innings of a 10-2 home loss against the Angels while filling in for an injured Derek Holland.	"It was like night and day. That was pretty obvious," Ranaudo said. "It was unfortunate that we didn't come out with a win, but I felt pretty good about my performance tonight and we played really hard. They just happened to pull it out at the end."	Dodgers manager Don Mattingly challenged a safe call by third-base umpire Chris Segal in the seventh, after Elvis Andrus advanced from first base on a two-out single to left field by Robinson Chirinos. Andrus appeared to have beaten the throw from Ethier with a headfirst slide, but TV replays showed he overslid the bag as Callaspo kept the glove on him.	The Dodgers put runners at the corners in the bottom half with a leadoff single by Ethier and a hit-and-run single by Rollins with one out. Justin Turner pinch hit for Greinke and flied out to shallow center field on Ranaudo's 100th and final pitch before lefty Ross Detwiler came in and retired rookie Joc Pederson on a flyout.	Greinke retired his first nine batters on 34 pitches without allowing a ball hit to an outfielder. Shin-Soo Choo and Rougned Odor opened the Rangers' fourth with singles, but the 2009 American League Cy Young Award winner struck out Joey Gallo, retired Moreland on a fielder's choice grounder and got Andrus to fly out.	"Zack was on his game today, man," Grandal said. "He was throwing harder than he usually does, so he must have been feeling good. ... Throughout the first three innings, I thought we might have a pretty good shot of throwing a no-hitter."	COMINGS AND GOINGS	Rangers: 1B Kyle Blanks was placed on the 15-day disabled list because of inflammation in both Achilles tendons.	Dodgers: Recalled LHP Daniel Coulombe from Triple-A Oklahoma City and optioned OF Chris Heisey.	UP NEXT	Rangers: RHP Colby Lewis (6-3) opposes Chris Sale in the opener of a three-game series at Chicago, having recorded victories in each of his previous five starts against the White Sox -- and shutouts in each of his last two at U.S. Cellular Field.	Dodgers: RHP Mike Bolsinger (4-1) gets the assignment Friday night for the opener of a three-game set against the Giants at Chavez Ravine. His mound opponent is rookie Chris Heston, who followed up his June 9 no-hitter against the Mets with a 4-0 home loss to the Diamondbacks.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

NEW YORK --  After everything he's encountered, Alex Rodriguez broke into a big smile -- all the way around the bases.	Rodriguez homered for his 3,000th career hit and the New York Yankees beat Detroit 7-2 Friday night, the highlight so far in what's become a resurgent season for the disgraced slugger.	"A year ago today, I didn't know if this day would come," he said. "There were some really dark days."	"Sometimes, I never thought I'd get the uniform back on," he added.	Out of baseball last season while serving a drug suspension, Rodriguez wasted no time, connecting in the first inning on a first-pitch, 95 mph fastball from Tigers ace Justin Verlander.	"I was happy to get it out of the way," Rodriguez said.	The solo homer made him the 29th player in major league history to reach 3,000 hits. He was the first to do it since Yankees great Derek Jeter homered from the very same batter's box in 2011.	"It's a magical number," Rodriguez said. "I'm very happy to be in the club."	A-Rod turns 40 next month. The three-time AL MVP launched his 13th homer of the season and has enjoyed a productive year as a designated hitter after returning from his suspension.	Rodriguez hit his 667th career home run after beginning the day with a .299 lifetime average in 21 seasons.	"He's obviously been very open about how appreciative he is to get the opportunity to come back and play, and a year ago he wasn't sure what the future held for him," teammate Brett Gardner said.	"He's been a lot of fun to be around and he's been having a lot of fun, and I think we've been playing pretty well and he's been playing pretty well, and it's a lot of fun to be a part of," he said.	Gardner and Didi Gregorius also homered as the Yankees won their third in a row. Detroit has lost four of six.	With the crowd at Yankee Stadium standing in anticipation, Rodriguez sent a high drive to right field. He held onto the bat as he took a few steps toward first base, and outfielder J.D. Martinez bumped into the wall as he backed up.	Fans roared as the ball sailed a half-dozen rows into the seats.	The homer was Rodriguez's fifth in 35 at-bats off Verlander.	"It's early, I wasn't really sure if he'd be swinging first pitch or not. In retrospect, I think he was trying to get 3,000 out of the way," Verlander said.	"I don't ever want to give up a hit. So I definitely don't want to be a part of the history that way," he added.	Retrieving the souvenir ball might be harder for Rodriguez than hitting it. Zack Hample, a 37-year-old who describes himself as a professional home run ball catcher, wound up with the prized souvenir.	Hample originally told the Yankees that he had no intention of giving it back. He watched the ninth inning with team president Randy Levine and chief operating officer Lonn Trost, and said he's considering what to do.	"Now, I'm thinking about it," he told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.	"There's no right thing to do," he said. "I want to enjoy the moment."	A day earlier, Hample tweeted that Rodriguez "deserves favors from no one, least of all a fan."	Rodriguez mentioned the fan who caught Jeter's home run ball for his 3,000th hit. That man was all too eager to return it to the former Yankees star.	"Where's Jeet's guy? That's the guy I needed," Rodriguez said. "I wasn't so lucky."	Rodriguez pointed to the crowd a couple of times and blew a kiss to his two daughters sitting behind the backstop after crossing the plate. He was greeted by Mark Teixeira and other teammates between the plate and the dugout, and got a big hug from manager Joe Girardi.	The only other players to hit a homer for No. 3,000 were Jeter and Wade Boggs.	"I'm enjoying this season as much as any," Rodriguez said.	Adam Warren (5-4) gave up two runs in a career-high eight innings. He beat Detroit for the second time this season.	Verlander (0-1) lost in his second start of the season and the 300th of his career. He began the season on the disabled list with a strained right triceps, and made his season debut last weekend.	Verlander gave up six runs and 10 hits in 6 2/3 innings. He fell to 0-4 at the new Yankee Stadium.	Miguel Cabrera's streak of consecutive games with an RBI ended at six.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: C Alex Avila (sore left knee) is traveling with the team on its road trip, catching bullpen sessions. When he's ready, he'll go on a minor league rehab assignment.	Yankees: OF Mason Williams jammed his right shoulder trying to get back into first base on a pickoff. He was examined and no further tests are scheduled.	UP NEXT	Tigers: RHP Alfredo Simon (7-3, 2.58 ERA) has done extremely well against A-Rod. Rodriguez is 0 for 7 in his career vs. Simon, striking out twice and walking once.	Yankees: RHP Nathan Eovaldi (5-2, 5.12) will start on three days' rest for the first time in his career. He threw just 36 pitches in his previous game, giving up eight runs while getting only two outs at Miami.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

WASHINGTON --  The Washington Nationals used a collective effort to win without Bryce Harper.	Joe Ross struck out 11 in his third major league start, and the Nationals beat A.J. Burnett and Pittsburgh 4-1 on Friday night to end the Pirates' eight-game winning streak.	Playing without Harper, who's sidelined with a left hamstring strain, the Nationals got at least one hit from every starter in the lineup -- including Ross.	More importantly, the 22-year-old Ross (2-1) allowed one run, six hits and a walk in 7 1/3 innings.	"I always thought of myself as being good enough to be up here, but I don't think I could have imagined doing so well so soon," Ross said.	Burnett (6-3) gave up 14 hits, the most in a career that began in 1999. The 38-year-old did, however, strike out seven to move past Andy Pettitte into 37th place on the career list with 2,451.	"The ball was up a little bit for A.J. tonight and we took advantage of it," Washington manager Matt Williams said. "We had a lot of opportunities out there, which we created, and that's great."	Williams talked before the game having his players be more aggressive to help boost the offense -- an approach that became evident in a two-run first inning.	Denard Span led off with a single and took third on a hit-and-run single by Anthony Rendon. With Yunel Escobar batting, Rendon broke for second and reached the base on a run-scoring groundout before Ramos capped the uprising with an RBI double.	That turned out to be all the runs Washington needed to back Ross.	"A good formula for us tonight," Williams said.	David Carpenter got the final two outs in the eighth inning and Drew Storen worked the ninth for his 20th save.	Wilson Ramos had two hits and two RBI for the Nationals, who ended a four-game home losing streak. Washington stranded nine and went 4 for 17 with runners in scoring position.	Yet the Nationals won anyway on a day Harper avoided the disabled list, although that could still happen if he's slow to recover from the injury.	"It was a good work day for him today," Williams said. "We'll see where he is (Saturday)."	Burnett gave up four runs, three earned, in 6 2/3 innings. It was a struggle from the outset.	"You can't give up," he said. "It was different, but I was still able to get a groundball here and there."	Pittsburgh pitchers had a 0.69 ERA during the eight-game run, including a five-hit shutout by Burnett against Philadelphia on Sunday.	In this one, Burnett gave up six hits by the second inning and 10 after five.	"It wasn't his A-stuff," manager Clint Hurdle said. "The fastball command was in and out, the balls were more elevated tonight. He didn't have the curveball he's had from start to finish at times. His will to compete got things done out there on the mound and kept us in the ballgame tonight."	After Washington jumped ahead in the first inning, Gregory Polanco singled in a run for Pittsburgh in the second. Ramos made it 3-1 with a third-inning RBI single.	Washington went up 4-1 in the seventh with an RBI triple by Danny Espinoza. Polanco left the game after banging into the wall in right field trying to make the catch, but Hurdle said that was merely a precautionary move that enabled him to make a double-switch while removing Burnett.	TRAINERS ROOM	Pirates: Jung Ho Kang started at 3B and Josh Harrison moved to 2B because Neil Walker was experiencing "stomach discomfort," according to Hurdle.	Nationals: RHP Stephen Strasburg (neck) is scheduled to throw a bullpen session on Saturday.	ON DECK	Pirates: Francisco Liriano (4-5, 2.94 ERA) starts Saturday against the Nationals. He's 3-1 with a 1.29 ERA in his last five starts.	Nationals: Max Scherzer (7-5, 1.93) looks for an encore to his last outing, a one-hit shutout of Milwaukee with 16 strikeouts.	BABY ON BOARD	Nationals RHP Tanner Roark was placed on the paternity list and RHP Taylor Hill was recalled from Triple-A Syracuse.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PHILADELPHIA --  After all the negative attention they've received this week, it certainly felt good for the Cardinals to bust out of their slump.	Randal Grichuk homered and had three hits, and Kolten Wong and Yadier Molina also went deep as St. Louis set season highs for runs and hits in a 12-4 rout of the Philadelphia Phillies on Friday night.	The Cardinals avoided their second three-game losing streak of the season while breaking out of the offensive funk that followed Tuesday's news of a federal investigation into whether club officials illegally hacked into the Houston Astros' player database.	The Cardinals batted .211 with five runs in the first three games after the story broke. If the investigation had any bearing on the lackluster offense, they certainly put it out of their minds against the Phillies.	St. Louis pounded out 16 hits, including six for extra bases. Jhonny Peralta doubled and had three RBI, Mark Reynolds had a two-run double and 10 Cardinals got hits.	"It's good to see these kind of days to give everybody a good shot in the arm, confidence-wise, about our offense," manager Mike Matheny said.	Ryan Howard homered for Philadelphia, which snapped a nine-game losing streak on Thursday. The last-place Phillies sank 23 games under .500.	"Tough, tough game," manager Ryne Sandberg said. "Not much out there going right. We fell behind early and with not swinging the bats, it was a tough combination. Right from the get-go it was a tough game."	Tyler Lyons (2-0) won his second straight after going 13 consecutive starts without a win dating back to 2013. He earned a victory Saturday over the Royals and cruised to his latest one behind double-digit run support.	Lyons allowed three runs and seven hits in five innings with five strikeouts and one walk. He also helped himself with the bat, singling twice with an RBI and scoring three runs.	"He had a good all-around day," Matheny said. "It got a little hairy a couple times. He was able to pitch his way through it, which is something he hasn't been able to do in the past, which is a great sign."	Even if running the bases tired him some, Lyons was happy to contribute on offense.	"I mean, ideally, sit there, relax, get your time in between innings," he said. "But being on base is obviously a good thing, too. You get to hopefully score a few runs or help the team score a few runs. I guess at the end of the day you take the runs, for sure."	Phillippe Aumont (0-1) struggled in a spot start for injured Philadelphia ace Cole Hamels, allowing six runs and five hits in four innings.	It was the first career start for Aumont, who entered 1-5 with a 6.13 ERA in 45 big league relief appearances. He switched to a starting role this spring in an attempt to improve his command and had some success in the minors, going 3-4 with a 2.35 ERA in 14 outings (10 starts). But against the Cardinals, Aumont walked seven and threw a wild pitch. Forty-eight of his 104 pitches were balls.	Aumont continues to show glimpses of promise, but wildness derails any consistency -- something he said is mental.	"It has to be between the ears," Aumont said. "It's frustrating to be in the position, fighting it. It was just a constant battle with myself. That's what it's been my whole career -- just me, myself and I out there. Because when I execute my pitches, I get these guys out."	Two-run homers by Wong and Molina highlighted a four-run second inning that gave the Cardinals a 4-0 lead. In the fourth, Peralta drove in Matt Carpenter and Lyons -- both of whom walked -- to put St. Louis up by six. And the Cardinals scored five runs on six hits against Justin De Fratus in the fifth.	Aumont and De Fratus combined to throw 162 pitches in six innings, 67 of which were balls.	HAPPY HOWARD	Howard homered for the second straight game, putting the Phillies on the board with a three-run shot in the fifth. A Missouri native whose favorite team growing up was the Cardinals, Howard homered for the 21st time in 62 career games against St. Louis.	STARTERS STRUGGLING	Phillies starters have gone 24 straight games without a victory, dating to May 23. They are 0-15 with a 5.97 ERA during that stretch.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: Matheny said there's no timetable for the return of RHP Lance Lynn (forearm), who has been on the DL since June 8.	Phillies: Hamels indicated he will make his next scheduled start Wednesday against the Yankees. Hamels missed Friday's turn with a strained right hamstring.	UP NEXT	Cardinals: RHP John Lackey (5-4, 3.59 ERA) looks for his first road win of the season Saturday night in the middle game of the series. Lackey is 0-3 with a 6.49 ERA in 11 starts away from home.	Phillies: RHP Aaron Harang (4-8, 3.24) will try to halt a five-game losing streak. Harang, whose last win came on May 15, has a 6.07 ERA during his skid. He is 7-16 with a 4.39 ERA in 28 starts against St. Louis.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

TORONTO --  Marco Estrada's brilliant start overshadowed the latest round of bad blood between the Blue Jays and Orioles.	Estrada took a no-hitter into the eighth inning, Edwin Encarnacion had two RBI and Toronto won its ninth straight home game Friday night, beating Baltimore 5-4.	"He had everything working," Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said of Estrada.	Batting for Steve Pearce, pinch-hitter Jimmy Paredes broke up Estrada's no-hit bid with a bloop single to left to begin the eighth, ending a streak of 15 straight outs.	Bench coach DeMarlo Hale, filling in for the ejected Gibbons, immediately came out and replaced Estrada with Roberto Osuna. Estrada, who threw a season-high 118 pitches, left to a standing ovation from the crowd of 32.322.	"I wanted to keep going," Estrada said. "If I had to throw 200 pitches today, I would have."	Estrada (5-3) won his fourth straight start, allowing one run in seven-plus innings. He walked four and struck out six.	"We knew the changeup was a big pitch for him," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. "He's got great arm speed on it. It's one of those that you can know it's coming and still not get a good pass at it."	Dave Stieb still has thrown the only no-hitter in Blue Jays history, doing it against Cleveland on Sept. 2, 1990.	Adam Jones hit a two-out, two-run single off Brett Cecil in the ninth, but Cecil struck out Chris Davis for his fifth save.	The nine-game streak is Toronto's longest run at home since 1998, when they also won nine. The Blue Jays won a record 10 straight at home in 1985.	The Blue Jays and Orioles, AL East rivals who have feuded several times in recent seasons, wasted no time in turning up the tension.	Toronto's Jose Bautista was hit by a pitch in the first and Gibbons was ejected for arguing after both benches were warned.	Orioles right-hander Mike Wright (2-3) brushed Bautista back with an 0-1 pitch, prompting warnings from plate umpire CB Bucknor. Gibbons came out and was ejected before engaging in a lengthy discussion with crew chief Dale Scott.	Orioles manager Buck Showalter came out at the end of the first to speak with Bucknor, but was not ejected.	Osuna and Hale were ejected after Osuna hit Jones to load the bases with one out in the eighth.	Gibbons said he was "a little bit shocked" at the spate of ejections.	"There was a little paranoia or something there," he said.	Bautista has a history with Orioles reliever Darren O'Day dating to 2013, but several different incidents have fueled the rivalry. The most recent came in an April 21 game at Toronto when Bautista argued with Jones after Orioles rookie Jason Garcia threw behind the Blue Jays slugger.	Bautista, who traded words with Baltimore's dugout after being hit, didn't bite when asked how he felt about the incident.	"I'm not going to contribute to turn this into TMZ or a gossip column," he said.	Jones wasn't too bothered about being hit, but did say the warnings might have been premature.	"I wasn't too happy when the warnings came out immediately," Jones said. "The umpires are trying to get a hold of the game. I understand it."	Wright lost his third straight start, giving up four runs and three hits in 1 1/3 innings, his shortest start of the season.	"I feel like my last three outings have been a battle," Wright said. "I've got to figure some stuff out to give my team a chance."	DICKEY'S HEAVY HEART	Toronto placed RHP R.A. Dickey on the bereavement list following his father's death. Harry Lee Dickey died Tuesday at 63. Dickey went 7 1/3 innings and allowed one run in Toronto's 7-1 home victory Thursday night over the New York Mets. He's expected to make his next start, Tuesday at Tampa Bay. The Blue Jays recalled INF Munenori Kawasaki to take Dickey's spot.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: Jones returned as DH after missing three games with a sore right shoulder. He's expected to play the outfield Saturday. ... 2B Jonathan Schoop (right knee) went 0 for 4 with three strikeouts in his first rehab game at Double-A Bowie.	UP NEXT	Orioles: RHP Kevin Gausman is expected to be activated from the 15-day DL to start Saturday. It will be the first start of the season for Gausman, who made eight relief appearances before landing on the DL with a sore shoulder. He went 0-1 with a 5.40 ERA in three rehab starts.	Blue Jays: LHP Mark Buehrle is 3-0 with a 3.50 ERA in three starts against the Orioles this season. However, he's gone 1/3 with a 4.67 ERA in day games. Buehrle's lone daytime victory came April 10 at Baltimore, his 200th career win.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

CLEVELAND --  Asdrubal Cabrera's return to Cleveland couldn't have gone much better.	Cabrera, who played eight seasons with the Indians, hit one of three solo home runs for Tampa Bay, leading the Rays to a 4-1 victory Friday night.	Cabrera, who played for the Indians from 2007 until being traded to Washington last July, broke a 1-all tie with a two-out homer in the second inning.	"It was special," said Cabrera, who also singled in the seventh. "Earlier in the first inning I was a little nervous, but after I hit the homer I felt better."	Joey Butler homered in the first inning and Steven Souza Jr. added a home run in the ninth for Tampa Bay, which has won seven of eight.	Cabrera admitted playing against his former teammates and being in the visitors' clubhouse was a different feeling.	"It was kind of weird," he said. "All your friends are on the other side, but as soon as you play ball you have to forget about it and do your job and try to win."	Rookie right-hander Nathan Karns (4-3) allowed one run in 5 1/3 innings for his first win since May 13.	Four relievers followed with Brad Boxberger pitching the ninth for his 17th save. Boxberger walked two, but struck out Michael Bourn to end the game.	The Rays lead the AL East by one game over the New York Yankees.	Carlos Carrasco (8-6) gave up three runs in 6 2/3 innings. Cleveland fell to 13-20 at home and hasn't won consecutive games since a three-game winning streak May 30-June 2.	Jason Kipnis was 3 for 4, extending his hitting streak to 14 games. He has hit safely in 23 consecutive home games.	Rays rookie manager Kevin Cash was Cleveland's bullpen coach on manager Terry Francona's staff the last two seasons. Cash was a catcher for Boston when Francona managed the Red Sox.	"Really happy for Asdrubal Cabrera coming back," Cash said. "These fans got to see him play and really play well. I know they probably didn't like the home run but it's nice to come back to your home team that you grew up in and play well, so we're happy for him."	Cabrera, who signed with the Rays in January, came into the game batting .204. The homer was his fourth of the season.	Butler's one-out homer gave Tampa Bay the lead. Karns' wild pitch with Carlos Santana batting scored Kipnis from third base and tied the game in the bottom of the inning.	Jake Elmore added a sacrifice fly in the seventh.	Francona thought Carrasco pitched well enough to win.	"Overall, actually pretty good," Francona said of Carrasco's performance. "Two solo homers. You never want to see the homers, but two solo homers and a sac fly. On a lot of nights, we're probably saying he pitched pretty well."	Kipnis started the eighth with a single off Jake McGee, but was doubled up when Souza made a sliding catch of Francisco Lindor's fly ball near the right field line and threw to first.	GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN	The Indians showed a "welcome back" video for Cash during batting practice that featured the Rays manager being body-slammed by Indians reliever Marc Rzepczynski in the bullpen last season.	Francona called Cash "one of the most special people I've come across in this game," but he found some humor in the matchup. Asked if he and Cash would try to out-think one another, Francona said, "I'm not very smart and he's not much smarter."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: OF/DH John Jaso (bruised left wrist) took batting practice for the first time since being injured on opening day.	Indians: C Yan Gomes (stiff neck) was out of the lineup, but is expected to play in the next day or two.	UP NEXT	Rays: RHP Erasmo Ramirez has won six of seven decisions since April 19. He recorded his career-high sixth in his last start against Washington.	Indians: RHP Corey Kluber, who has lost his last three starts, will go against the Rays.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

CINCINNATI --  Fastball, slider, curve -- everything was working for Mike Leake. It showed in the Miami Marlins' futile swings.	Leake allowed only two singles through seven innings Friday night, and Marlon Byrd homered in his return from a broken wrist, leading the Cincinnati Reds to a 5-0 victory.	The Reds have won 10 of their last 13 against the Marlins. Miami has been held to four runs or less in each of their last 11 games against Cincinnati.	Leake (4-4) has a history of success against the Marlins, going 4-1 in five career starts. He retired the first 13 batters Friday before giving up two walks. Christian Yelich singled through the hole at shortstop with two outs in the sixth for Miami's first hit.	Marcell Ozuna singled in the seventh off Leake, who walked three, hit a batter and threw 92 pitches. Pedro Villarreal pitched the ninth, completing a four-hitter.	It was Leake's best performance since pulling out of a three-game losing streak in May.	"During those three games, I just kind of lost my head," Leake said. "I don't know how to explain it. I just couldn't think, I guess. I feel like I'm getting it back."	All the way back.	"He had really good stuff," manager Bryan Price said. "In the first inning, he did something he usually doesn't do. He was able to establish his breaking ball. He had better velocity today."	Byrd returned from a broken right wrist and homered in his second at-bat off Dan Haren (6-4), a solo shot to center. Byrd's wrist was hit by a pitch on June 2, and he made a faster-than-expected recovery.	Byrd is 14 for 30 career off Haren with five doubles, a triple and three homers.	"Byrd's hit me in the past," said Haren, who gave up four hits in 6 1/3 innings. "I fell behind in the count and he put a good swing on it.	"This is a tough place to pitch, but Mike Leake was on tonight. He had it going, for sure."	Jay Bruce broke the game open with a two-run double in the eighth off Brad Hand, leaving the outfielder 8 for 12 in his last three games.	Todd Frazier doubled and singled, extending his hitting streak to seven games.	Frazier had hit two homers in each of his last two games, the first Red to do so since Barry Larkin in 1991. The major league record is three straight multi-homer games.	CENTURY MARK	Miami's Dee Gordon singled in the eighth for his 100th hit of the season in only 65 games. He became the sixth NL player since 1961 to get 100 hits in so few games, according to STATS.	WEARING GREEN	The Reds wore green trim and shamrocks on their jerseys as part of their annual Irish Heritage Night promotion	MAKE IT 40	Ichiro Suzuki pinch hit in the eighth, completing his ballpark circuit. Great American was the only current ballpark he had never played in. It's the 40th ballpark/stadium he's played in during his career.	ANOTHER MOVE	The Reds optioned reliever Donovan Hand to Triple-A Louisville to open a roster spot for Byrd. The right-hander pitched three scoreless innings during Cincinnati's 8-4, 13-inning win over Detroit on Wednesday.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: C J.T. Realmuto was back in the lineup after missing two games with back soreness. He went 0 for 4.	Reds: Rookie starter Jon Moscot had surgery on his non-throwing shoulder Friday. He dislocated his left shoulder while tagging a runner on Monday in Detroit. He can begin throwing in three months.	UP NEXT	Marlins: Tom Koehler (5-4) has lost his only other start against the Reds, giving up two runs and five hits in seven innings last season.	Reds: Anthony DeSclafani (5-4) makes his first appearance against the Marlins, who traded him in December in the deal for starter Mat Latos.	---	Follow Joe Kay on Twitter: http://twitter.com/apjoekay	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

ATLANTA --  Backed by a big hit from his former Triple-A roommate, Matt Wisler enjoyed a major league debut that ranked with the best in Atlanta history.	Wisler allowed only one run in eight innings to outpitch Jacob deGrom, and Jace Peterson hit a two-run double in the eighth to lift the Atlanta Braves to a 2-1 win over the New York Mets on Friday night.	"At no point did he ever look out of place or intimidated by the moment," Braves catcher A.J. Pierzynski said of Wisler.	Even Wisler was surprised the nerves he felt warming up before the game didn't follow him to the mound.	"I honestly felt more calm than I probably should have," Wisler said, adding ultimately it felt like "another game."	The only other pitcher in Atlanta history to pitch at least eight innings and allow only one run or less in his debut was John Smoltz, who also held the Mets to one run in eight innings on July 23, 1988.	Wisler (1-0) allowed six hits and walked none. The NL East-leading Mets' only run off Wisler came on Michael Cuddyer's run-scoring single in the sixth.	"For my big league debut, to have a night like that was unbelievable," Wisler said.	Wisler and Peterson came to the Braves from the Padres in separate offseason trades. Wisler was San Diego's top prospect before coming to the Braves as a big part of the April 5 trade that sent closer Craig Kimbrel to the Padres.	Wisler and Peterson were Triple-A teammates in the San Diego organization. Wisler, 22, was called up from Triple-A Gwinnett before the game.	"We talked when I got here," Wisler said. "He promised to get me a couple runs."	Until the eighth inning, deGrom (7-5) was dominant on his 27th birthday. He allowed two runs and four hits, including two in the eighth.	After deGrom departed, left-hander Sean Gilmartin gave up Peterson's two-run double over the head of Juan Lagares in center field.	The Mets have scored a combined two runs in three straight losses, dropping their lead over second-place Washington to a half-game.	"We've gotten some very good pitching," Mets manager Terry Collins said. "We just aren't scoring runs."	Andrelton Simmons, who had a second-inning single for Atlanta's first hit, led off the eighth with a double to left field. One out later, pinch-hitter Pedro Ciriaco's infield hit left runners at first and third. Peterson gave Atlanta the lead with his double off Gilmartin.	DeGrom took his first loss since May 11.	Ruben Tejada led off the sixth with a double to left field and moved to third on Lucas Duda's fly ball to right. Cuddyer's grounder took a high bounce over Chris Johnson at third base for a run-scoring single.	It was the only inning Wisler allowed more than one baserunner.	ROSTER MOVE	Right-hander Sugar Ray Marimon was optioned to Gwinnett to clear a spot for Wisler.	SAVE FOR GRILLI	Jason Grilli pitched the ninth for his 19th save. With one out, Wilmer Flores reached on third baseman Juan Uribe's fielding error. With Flores still on first, Grilli struck out pinch-hitter Darrell Ceciliani to end the game.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: RHP Zack Wheeler, out for the season following Tommy John surgery, is from the Atlanta area and traveled from Florida to be with the team. Wheeler said his rehab has been slow and he hopes that starting to throw next month "will speed up the process a little bit."	Braves: 1B Freddie Freeman (sprained left wrist) missed his second straight start, but was "a lot better" and available as a defensive replacement, according to manager Fredi Gonzalez.	UP NEXT	Mets: Rookie RHP Noah Syndergaard, 0-3 with a 6.46 ERA in three road starts, will look for his first win away from New York when he faces the Braves on Saturday night. Syndergaard is 2-4 overall with a 3.76 ERA.	Braves: Atlanta also will start a rookie as RHP Williams Perez (3-0, 2.29) looks to continue his string of strong starts. Perez threw six scoreless innings in a win at Boston on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Eduardo Rodriguez went from awful to awfully good in five days.	Rodriguez pitched capably into the seventh inning, Mookie Betts had a career-best four hits and the Boston Red Sox beat the Kansas City Royals 7-3 on Friday night.	Rodriguez (3-1), who gave up nine runs in 4 2/3 innings against Toronto on Sunday, allowed one run and six hits in 6 1/3 innings.	"A back bounce start for him, there's no doubt," Red Sox manager John Farrell said. "He threw three quality pitches for strikes, but most importantly his fastball location was outstanding.	"We put up the five runs in the second and he pitches as if it was a nothing-nothing game. There's fluidity, concentration and quality execution. He backed up a rough outing a few days ago with a solid outing tonight."	Alcides Escobar's RBI-double in the fifth was the first run he allowed on the road in 18 1/3 innings.	"I mixed my pitches," Rodriguez said. "I threw to both sides of the plate with a slider and changeup."	The Royals could not solve the rookie left-hander.	"He was 96 with the fastball and 86 with the changeup," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "When you have an 8 to 10 mile-per-hour variation on your fastball and changeup and can command it, you're going to be tough."	The Red Sox batted around in the five-run second inning, which included an RBI-single by Betts. Blake Swihart contributed a two-run double, while Mike Napoli drove in two runs with a single.	Betts is 13 for 22, .590, in his past five games, raising his average to .267.	Boston's Hanley Ramirez hit his 14th home run in the fifth.	Yohan Pino (0-2), who was making his first start, was roughed up for six runs and 11 hits in 5 1/3 innings. Pino was recalled from Triple-A Omaha to fill in for Yordano Ventura, who went on the disabled list with ulnar nerve inflammation.	"You have to forget that (second) inning, keep working and make your pitches," Pino said.	The Red Sox' 16-hit attack featured five players with multi-hit games, including Pablo Sandoval, who doubled and singled to extend his hitting streak to nine games. Sandoval, who hit .429 against the Royals in the 2014 World Series, was benched Thursday after he used his cellphone during Wednesday's game in Atlanta.	The Red Sox have won seven of their past eight games against the Royals.	Eric Hosmer homered in the eighth for Kansas City, which added a run in the ninth on a double by Mike Moustakas.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: 2B Dustin Pedroia (left knee inflammation) was not in the lineup for the third time in four games, but is expected to play Saturday.	Royals: RHP Kris Medlen (reconstructive elbow surgery) made his first rehab start Friday for Double-A Northwest Arkansas, going four innings and allowing three runs, one earned, and four hits, while striking out five, walking none and hitting two batters. He threw 39 strikes in 60 pitches.	UP NEXT	Red Sox: RHP Rick Porcello, who is 0-5 with a 6.97 ERA in his past five outings, starts Saturday.	Royals: RHP Edinson Volquez, who starts the middle game of the series, is three strikeouts shy of 1,000.	LENGHTY CHALLENGE	The Red Sox challenged Swihart was safe when he was called out attempting to steal second in the fourth inning. After a 4-minute, 37-second delay, the ruling on the field was not overturned.	DOUBLING UP	The Red Sox grounded into five double plays, including David Ortiz and Swihart twice each.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MINNEAPOLIS --  The first half of June for Trevor Plouffe and the rest of the Minnesota Twins was quite the swoon.	This week, they have taken a few steps toward recovery.	Phil Hughes held the Chicago Cubs to two hits over eight innings, Plouffe doubled twice and drove in four runs and the Twins breezed to a 7-2 victory Friday night.	"We're over struggling. We don't want to do that anymore. We want to score some runs," said Plouffe, who moved into the team lead with 38 RBI.	Brian Dozier and Eddie Rosario had two hits each and scored twice and Eduardo Escobar drove in a run and hit one of six doubles by the Twins, who won for the third straight time after losing 11 of their first 15 games in June. They are 23-12 at home, tied for the best mark in the league with Toronto.	During the first half of the month, the Twins averaged a mere 2.47 runs per game. Plouffe's batting average was one of a bunch that took a big dive.	"I knew that something like that was coming. It just happens during the season," Plouffe said, citing insight from hitting coach Tom Brunansky about shortening slumps as a sign of progress: "It took me a couple of weeks. Maybe a couple years ago that might've taken a month."	Anthony Rizzo homered twice for the Cubs, including in the ninth against reliever J.R. Graham after manager Paul Molitor pulled Hughes after 95 pitches. After Rizzo's leadoff shot in the fourth, Hughes retired the last 15 batters he faced, working quickly against the free-swinging Cubs.	Hughes, who has given up a league-high-tying 16 home runs, has tried to work on incorporating a changeup into his arsenal without worrying about his velocity as much.	"It's not what I can be and it's not my best, but it was good to get me through a pretty good lineup," said Hughes (5-6), who struck out four without a walk for his first win in his last four turns.	The Twins stretched their errorless streak to eight straight games. Rosario made a slick running catch to the warning track in right on a drive by Castro to end the seventh, and they were flawless in the field.	The Twins met Kyle Hendricks (2-3) with three straight singles in the first inning and never stopped.	Hendricks, though, had no help behind him.	Shortstop Starlin Castro let a right-to-him ground ball hit by Plouffe get between his legs with the bases loaded while one run scored. Then, while Castro stared and sulked with the ball still in his glove, Rosario raced home, too. Hendricks flashed Castro an incredulous look, yelling at him to try to get his attention.	"I have no excuse for that," Castro said. "That kind of thing can't happen again."	Rosario has impressed the Twins with his instincts and hustle, whether it's making the right read on the bases or in the field. The rookie is hitting .284 with 10 extra-base hits in 116 at-bats, which doesn't hurt his cause, either.	"I like those plays. They can be a little bit of momentum shifters for you," Molitor said.	Cubs manager Joe Maddon saw that, too.	"If the other team feels an edge, so be it, but you can't permit it to cut into your will that particular night," he said.	Catcher Miguel Montero's throwing error in the sixth led to another run for the Twins. Hendricks has failed to finish six innings in nine of his 13 starts this year, including his last three turns. He allowed 11 hits and a walk while being charged with six earned runs and striking out only one.	QUIET DEBUT	Twins CF Byron Buxton dropped to 2 for 20 since being recalled from Double-A Chattanooga, but Molitor said he hadn't considered giving the organization's top prospect a rest yet.	"I don't think it's defeating him," Molitor said. "He still brings an element out there."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: Mike Olt, the forgotten opening day starter at 3B who's been out since the first week of the season with a broken right wrist, began rehab work on Friday with Double-A Tennessee. Standout rookie Kris Bryant is now entrenched at that position, but Maddon said he wasn't sure if Olt would play elsewhere on assignment.	Twins: RHP Ricky Nolasco, fitted for an orthotic to help his ailing right ankle that landed him on the DL two weeks ago, will start a throwing program Wednesday.	UP NEXT	The Cubs will send LHP Jon Lester to the mound on Saturday afternoon, opposite RHP Trevor May.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DENVER --  Taylor Jungmann started the game by throwing 31 consecutive fastballs.	Hey, it's his bread-and-butter pitch. It was working. So, why not bring heater after heater?	Ryan Braun hit a two-run homer and Jungmann threw six effective innings to help the Milwaukee Brewers snap a six-game losing streak with a 9-5 victory over the scuffling Colorado Rockies on Friday night.	Jungmann (2-1) didn't throw his first curveball until the third inning. Then again, he knows from experience that curves really don't break with the same kind of bite at this higher elevation. That's from experience after spending the first part of the season pitching down the road at Triple-A Colorado Springs.	"I think anytime you can get through the lineup on a fastball, if you're spotting it, especially the first time around, it's something you want to do," Jungmann said.	So catcher Jonathan Lucroy kept calling for a pitch that consistently hit mid-90s and had plenty of movement. Jungmann handcuffed Colorado's potent offense early before losing steam. The right-hander allowed four runs and eight hits.	"His fastball is deceiving," Lucroy explained. "It's tough to square up for a hitter."	Aramis Ramirez added a solo shot as the Brewers rediscovered the long ball after hitting only one homer in their losing streak. They had two off Jorge De La Rosa (4-3) in a three-run first inning.	Ben Paulsen finished a homer shy of the cycle for the Rockies, who have lost five straight.	"We just need to get better," Carlos Gonzalez said. "We're not hitting. We're not pitching. You can't win that way."	De La Rosa, who became the franchise's all-time wins leader in his last outing, allowed six runs and 11 hits in five innings. He gave up a combined 11 hits and six runs over his previous three June starts.	The Brewers tied a season high with 16 hits. Everyone in the lineup had at least one, including the first of Jungmann's career -- a bloop single in the fifth. He had the souvenir ball in his locker and plans to give it to his mother for safe keeping.	Ramirez and Shane Peterson had three hits each to help manager Craig Counsell pick up a win against the organization that selected him in the 11th round of the 1992 draft. Counsell played two seasons with Colorado before being traded.	Jungmann retired nine of his first 10 hitters, the only hiccup a quirky infield single by Paulsen in the second. A pigeon that landed near second baseman Hernan Perez flew away as the ball rolled toward it.	Up 6-0 in the fourth, Counsell had a feeling that might be enough.	"This is a place where you assume the tying run, no matter what's going on, is going to come to the plate at some point in the game," Counsell said. "That's kind of your thought. You do have to keep scoring."	He was nearly right. Nolan Arenado hit a two-run triple and Paulsen added an RBI double. In the sixth, Paulsen's RBI triple made it 6-4.	Milwaukee added three runs in the seventh to quiet the crowd and quell any thoughts of a rally.	"When you lose it never looks good," Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. "It always looks like you're flat when you don't score."	ROLE MODEL	As a young player, Counsell said he tried to model his game after Weiss, his former teammate.	"He was the first player I saw that I tried to say, `Hey, that's who I want to be when I got into professional baseball," Counsell said before the game.	Weiss was just as complimentary of Counsell.	"A gamer. Great professional," Weiss said. "It's great to see him back in uniform."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: OF Carlos Gomez (right groin, hip) ran Friday and "felt pretty good doing it," Counsell said. "It's a positive step." Counsell is hopeful Gomez can avoid a stint on the DL. "We can probably get through the weekend, but then probably have to make a decision."	Rockies: Reliever Rafael Betancourt (vertigo symptoms) will pitch Sunday in a rehab assignment with Triple-A Albuquerque. ... Sent down to work on his swing, OF Drew Stubbs is making some progress with Albuquerque. Stubbs is hitting .250. "He's in a pretty good place," Weiss said.	UP NEXT	Brewers: RHP Kyle Lohse (3-8, 6.44) gave up eight runs in an opening day loss to Colorado at Miller Park.	Rockies: RHP Chad Bettis (2-3, 3.74) faces the Brewers for the first time Saturday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  Albert Pujols doesn't like talking much about his swing when he's struggling. The Angels' slugger is even more reticent to discuss it when things are going well.	Even after hitting his 12th home run this month -- a grand slam that highlighted an eight-run seventh inning -- Pujols was reluctant to talk about his most recent power surge.	"I don't want to talk about that, I'm just seeing the ball good and putting my best swing," Pujols said after driving in five runs to help the Angels come from behind for a 12-7 victory over the Oakland Athletics on Friday night. "Same thing I've been doing all year long. I'm just getting better breaks, I guess."	Pujols hit his 20th home run of the season on a 1-1 pitch from reliever Edward Mujica (2-2), who was activated from the disabled list before the game. It was the 540th career home run for the Angels' slugger and his 13th grand slam.	The Angels, who trailed by five runs heading into the seventh, scored 10 runs over the final three innings while taking advantage of Oakland's sloppy defense. The A's committed three of their four errors in the seventh when Los Angeles sent 12 men to the plate.	"It's a great come-from-behind win," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "These guys didn't quit. Good at-bats the whole night and obviously big hits from Albert. Hopefully a win like this gives some guys, especially some guys that are struggling, a little confidence moving forward."	Johnny Giavotella drove in three runs for Los Angeles, which has won five of the last six games between the clubs.	Ben Zobrist and Stephen Vogt homered for the A's, who have lost two straight.	Fernando Salas (1-1) retired one batter for the win, the Angels' first in four games this season in which Oakland ace Sonny Gray has started.	Los Angeles trailed 7-2 before breaking out against Gray and three relievers in the seventh.	Gray walked the first two batters in the inning then gave up an RBI-single to Matt Joyce. Two batters after pinch-hitter Daniel Robertson drew a bases-loaded walk off reliever Drew Pomeranz, Mike Trout hit a sacrifice fly to left that deflected off Zobrist's glove, allowing Joyce to score without a throw.	Pujols followed with his 12th home run in the last 21 games. He had an RBI-double in the ninth.	"I knew I had a pretty good chance to go (out), especially down the line," Pujols said. "I've hit a couple of balls here that way. I was just praying to stay fair."	Giavotella, who had an RBI double in the second and a sacrifice fly in the fourth, added an RBI single to make it 10-7.	The A's committed three of their four errors in the inning, raising their total this season to 69, the most in the majors.	"We weren't very good defensively today," Oakland manager Bob Melvin said. "We have been better recently, but you're not going to win many games when you're making four errors."	Trevor Gott, Joe Smith and Cesar Ramos pitched one inning apiece to complete the win for Los Angeles.	Gray, who took a majors-low 1.60 ERA into the game, was in line for his ninth win until the Angels' outburst. He allowed six runs and five hits in six-plus innings while matching his career-low with two strikeouts. The Oakland ace also dodged a potential serious injury in the fourth when he speared Joyce's two-out line drive just as the ball neared his head.	Zobrist hit a three-run home run in the first inning off Angels starter Matt Shoemaker who allowed five runs and eight hits with two strikeouts in four-plus innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: 1B Ike Davis was activated from the DL before the game. Davis started and batted sixth. He went 1 for 4. ... To make room on the roster, RHP Arnold Leon was optioned to Triple-A Nashville and INF Andy Parrino was designated for assignment.	UP NEXT	Angels: RHP Jared Weaver (4-7) pitches the middle game of the series Saturday looking to end a three-start losing streak. Weaver has 13 career wins against Oakland.	Athletics: RHP Jesse Hahn (4-5) is winless in six starts against teams from the AL West this season.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PHOENIX --  Rubby De La Rosa had two things going for him Friday night -- a better handle on his two-seam fastball and a good rapport with catcher Welington Castillo.	That was all De La Rosa needed to fluster the San Diego Padres, who left 11 runners on base in Arizona's 4-2 win as the Diamondbacks handed James Shields his first loss of the season.	"Pitching down, down in the zone, and me and Castillo were staying on the same page. I just tried to stay focused and throw to him," De La Rosa said after allowing one earned run and five hits in seven innings. He struck out six and walked three.	"He is a young guy finding his way. It's the first time someone is allowing him to go out there," Diamondbacks manager Chip Hale said of the 26-year-old De La Rosa, new to the club this season. "If he has two or three bad outings he goes back to the minor leagues (in the past). We have committed to him."	Arizona scored three times in the third on RBI doubles by Aaron Hill and Castillo, along with Nick Ahmed's run-scoring single. Paul Goldschmidt walked and David Peralta doubled to start the rally.	Another run was taken off the board when Goldschmidt, originally ruled safe on a passed ball and tag play at home plate, was called out after a Padres challenge and replay review.	"You get two outs and a man on third you're thinking, we had a golden opportunity to really put something on them," Hale said. "Then we got the three hits in a row, beautiful. That was probably the biggest part of the game for us."	Shields (7-1) struggled with control for much of his outing, walking four, hitting a batter and uncorking two wild pitches. He allowed four runs and eight hits over six innings in his 15th start of the season.	"It wasn't his best outing, but he's a fighter," Padres interim manager Pat Murphy said. "We could have done some things to help him a little bit more, but I always feel great when you have a winner out on the mound."	De La Rosa (6-3) ran into some trouble in the fifth when two singles and two walks, all with two outs, produced the Padres' first run. De La Rosa had a 12-inning scoreless streak until then.	San Diego scored again in the eighth on Cory Spangenberg's sacrifice fly after a pair of Diamondbacks throwing errors and a walk.	Brad Ziegler earned a save in his 500th career appearance, escaping in the ninth after the Padres put runners on second and third with two outs.	The Diamondbacks, winners of six of their last eight games, went ahead in the first when Goldschmidt drove in A.J. Pollock with a groundout.	PADDED DOUBLE	Pollock was credited with a ground-rule double leading off the first when he hit a drive to left field and the ball got stuck between pieces of padding on the wall on the fly.	BACK IN THE BIGS	The Padres called up infielder Brett Wallace from Triple-A El Paso and optioned right-hander Cory Mazzoni in a corresponding move.	The 28-year-old Wallace was added to the 40-man roster when the club designated pitcher Eury De La Rosa for assignment. Wallace, who entered as a pinch-hitter late in the game, is back in the majors for the first time since 2013 with Houston. He's reunited with Murphy, his head coach in college at Arizona State.	Mazzoni allowed 20 earned runs in 8 2/3 innings over eight appearances.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: RHP Josh Johnson, coming back from Tommy John surgery, threw a simulated game Monday and left early with tingling in his fingers. Murphy said he didn't know more beyond Johnson being scheduled for an MRI.	Diamondbacks: RF Yasmany Tomas was hit on the left elbow by a first-inning pitch from Shields that registered 89 mph. Tomas was checked by trainers but stayed in the game for the moment. He made a diving catch of a sinking liner from Yangervis Solarte for the first out of the third inning, then was replaced by Danny Dorn to start the fourth. Tomas has a bruise and X-rays were negative, the club announced. Hale said he'll likely give Tomas off on Saturday. ... RHP Archie Bradley threw 54 pitches in a simulated game Thursday. He's been on the 15-day disabled list since June 4 with right shoulder tendinitis.	UP NEXT	Padres: RHP Tyson Ross pitches Saturday against the Diamondbacks. Ross (3-7) has lost his last two starts and leads the team in walks with 42 and wild pitches with seven.	Diamondbacks: LHP Robbie Ray will make his fifth start of the season and the first of his career against the Padres. He's 2-1 with a 1.09 ERA.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SEATTLE --  Roenis Elias gave up home runs on his first and last pitches of the game. He was more than good enough in between.	Elias settled down after the first-pitch home run, allowing four hits over seven-plus innings, and Mark Trumbo drove in three runs to pace the Seattle Mariners to a 5-2 victory over Houston on Friday night, ending the Astros' five-game winning streak.	"I think it probably ticked him off a little bit, the home run, and probably made him even more determined," Mariners manager Lloyd McClendon said. "He did a nice job."	Elias (4-4), who had lost three of his previous four starts, gave up two runs -- solo homers on his first and last pitches. He matched his career high with 10 strikeouts without a walk, but he hit two batters	Mark Lowe finished the eighth and Carson Smith pitched a perfect ninth for his fourth save in five chances.	"I thought he did a good job mixing in his secondary pitches," Astros manager A.J. Hinch said of Ellis. "His breaking ball was really good, change was good, velocity was up a bit. Outside of his first pitch of the game and last pitch of the game, we couldn't put a ton together."	Elias' performance was in stark contrast to his last start, also against the Astros, when he gave up a career-high eight runs, seven earned, and seven hits with four walks in 3 1/3 innings.	"I was more aggressive and had more command of all my pitches," Elias said through a translator.	Robinson Cano, who was a late scratch Thursday night with a stiff lower back, had three hits and reached on an error for the Mariners, while Nelson Cruz reached four times on two singles and two walks.	"That's the thing that we've been looking for," Cano said. "We're trying to be more consistent. That's what we're trying to do, to be more consistent. That's what we need to do."	George Springer staked the Astros to a 1-0 lead, lining the first pitch over the wall in left field wall for his 11th home run, extending his hitting streak to a career-high 12 games.	The Mariners answered with two unearned runs in the bottom half, then added one in the third and two in the fifth, all charged to starter Lance McCullers (3-2) who allowed six hits and walked three in 4 1/3 innings.	"I just think it wasn't our night," McCullers said. "A lot of things didn't go our way. Especially, you know, in that situation, they are just hit in the right spots, not hard enough to turn two, so . it was frustrating all night."	Marwin Gonzalez opened the eighth with his fourth homer for the Astros' other run.	Seattle loaded the bases in the first on Logan Morrison's opposite-field bloop single, a walk to Austin Jackson and an error by second baseman Gonzalez on Cano's bouncer.	Cruz then walked to force in a run and an RBI groundout by Trumbo, who had only one RBI in his first 12 games with Seattle.	The Mariners increased the lead to 3-1 in the third on singles by Cano, Cruz and Trumbo.	Seattle pushed across two more runs in the fifth on an RBI-single by Kyle Seager and another RBI groundout by Trumbo.	"Not all those were the prettiest ways to get it done, but they're every bit as effective at times," Trumbo said. "Especially in that first case, all the credit goes to Nelson, getting a great jump off first and forcing them to take the one out and get the RBI. That's the kind of teamwork that you look for."	UP NEXT:	Astros: LHP Dallas Keuchel (8-2, 2.04 ERA) has gone at least six innings in 25 consecutive starts, the longest active streak in the majors. He has not faced the Mariners this season, but was 3-1 with a 2.17 ERA and 25 strikeouts in four starts against them last year.	Mariners: RHP Taijuan Walker (4-6, 5.00 ERA) is 3-1 with a 1.55 ERA in his last four starts. He has walked only four in 29 innings in those four starts, after walking four in each start before his recent improved stretch.	POWER OUTAGE:	The Astros lost their first game when hitting multiple home runs this season. They had been 27-0.	CORREA STOPPED:	Houston rookie shortstop Carlos Correa, who was 0 for 4 with one strikeout, did not reach base for the first time in his 11-game career.	TRAINER'S ROOM:	Astros: OF Jake Marisnick was placed on the 15-day DL with a left hamstring strain and OF Colby Rasmus was activated off the bereavement list. 2B Jose Altuve missed his second straight game with a sore right hamstring. "He's day to day and today's not the day," Hinch said.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

LOS ANGELES --  Aside from becoming the first Giants catcher to hit a grand slam and steal a base in the same game since Roger Bresnahan in 1903, Buster Posey also got a huge kick out of the way his team continued to outplay the Los Angeles Dodgers.	Posey hit his third career slam and the defending World Series champions got two RBI each from Brandon Crawford and Matt Duffy in a 9-5 win Friday night. San Francisco's eighth victory in 10 meetings with the rival Dodgers this season put the Giants within 1 1/2 games of the NL West leaders.	"These games are fun because the fans make it fun for us," Posey said. "I mean, the Giants-Dodgers games, whether it's at AT&T Park or here, it's just an extra electricity and the passion that goes back for generations comes out."	Posey gave San Francisco a 4-1 lead in the third with his 10th homer of the season, ending a drought of 46 at-bats. The 2012 NL MVP and league batting champion drove a 2-2 pitch into the Dodgers' bullpen in left field after singles by Gregor Blanco and Nori Aoki and a two-out walk to Angel Pagan.	"I was really just trying to stay small there and not try to do too much, especially with two strikes, because you can get in trouble if you do think home run," said Posey, who stole his first base of the season in the second inning. "I was able to see some pitches in that at-bat, and fortunately I got a pitch that stayed up."	Chris Heston (7-5) allowed three runs, seven hits and no walks over 5 2/3 innings in his second start since his no-hitter against the New York Mets on June 9. The rookie right-hander was coming off a 4-0 home loss to Arizona on Sunday.	"He's been big for us," Posey said. "He's stepped in and pitched some big games for us. Every time he takes the ball, I think he expects to have a good outing."	Mike Bolsinger (4-2) gave up a season-high five runs in 5 1/3 innings, along with eight hits and three walks. Half of the right-hander's six strikeouts came in the fourth, the only inning in which he did not allow a baserunner.	"We were just able to capitalize after getting a few guys on," Posey said. "He's a guy who's not going to give in. I mean, you saw he threw maybe three breaking balls on 3-0 counts tonight. So you just can't get too aggressive with a guy like that."	Posey's slam was the first allowed by Bolsinger in 18 big league starts, and the second against the Dodgers this season.	"He's even more difficult when you've got bases loaded and you can't make a mistake," Bolsinger said. "There's a reason why he's one of the best hitters in the league. He's definitely a tough out, always, in any situation. I think I got a little too lazy on that curveball and basically just kind of served it up there to him."	Justin Turner had two doubles and a solo homer for the Dodgers after getting grazed by an 0-2 pitch his first time up. Pinch-hitter Alberto Callaspo delivered an RBI single in the ninth against Michael Broadway, but Santiago Casilla struck out Yasiel Puig for his 19th save in 22 chances.	Yasmani Grandal opened the scoring in the second with an RBI single that snapped a string of 32 consecutive scoreless innings by Giants pitchers against the Dodgers -- including a three-game sweep at San Francisco last month by scores of 2-0, 4-0 and 4-0. It was the longest shutout streak by the Giants against any team since they relocated to the West Coast along with the Dodgers in 1958.	The Dodgers closed to 4-3 in the third with three consecutive hits, including Turner's RBI double and Adrian Gonzalez's run-scoring single. Heston minimized the damage by retiring Howie Kendrick on a double-play grounder.	"That was one of those innings that can spiral out of control pretty quickly," Posey said. "So I thought he did a nice job to get that double play from Kendrick and get us back in the dugout after they got those two runs."	The Giants added a run in the sixth with consecutive doubles by Brandon Belt and Crawford. Rookie center fielder Joc Pederson robbed Blanco of extra bases with a diving grab.	The Giants increased the margin to 9-3 in the seventh with four runs, including Josh Ravin's bases-loaded walk to Crawford, a two-run single by Duffy and an RBI single by Blanco against the rookie right-hander.	Blanco was reinstated from the concussion disabled list before the game after missing the previous 10.	UP NEXT	Giants: RHP Tim Hudson (4-6) scattered five hits through 6 1/3 innings against the Dodgers on May 19 in a 2-0 victory at AT&T Park. The 17-year veteran has allowed one home run in 34 innings over his last six starts.	Dodgers: RHP Carlos Frias (4-4) gets a rematch with Hudson after yielding a run over six innings in the hard-luck defeat at San Francisco.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

TORONTO --  Darren O'Day kept his cool in a critical moment, and gave the Baltimore Orioles a big boost.	O'Day escaped a bases-loaded jam in the eighth, Caleb Joseph singled home the go-ahead run with two outs in the ninth and the Orioles beat the Blue Jays 5-3 Saturday, ending Toronto's home winning streak at nine games.	Toronto loaded the bases with no outs in the eighth before O'Day escaped by striking out Russell Martin, Dioner Navarro and Kevin Pillar.	"If you can stay calm in those situations, you have an advantage," O'Day said. "You've just got to focus on each pitch and when you do that, you can stay in the moment."	Baltimore's Manny Machado didn't expect O'Day to turn Toronto away empty-handed.	"You load up the bases with no outs, and you're already thinking at least one run is going to come in," said Machado, who had three hits, including a pair of doubles.	O'Day celebrated with a fist pump as he walked off the mound after striking out Pillar.	"We had them on the ropes, but there's nobody tougher out there than O'Day," Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said.	Half the sellout crowd of 46,018 thought Navarro had cleared the bases with a grand slam, but his deep drive to right was ruled foul, with the call confirmed by video review.	"It kind of hooked at the last second," Navarro said.	Fired up by O'Day's escape act, the Orioles rallied against Aaron Loup (2-4) to break a 2-all tie the ninth. J.J. Hardy reached on a force play and Ryan Flaherty was hit by a pitch before Joseph snapped an 0-for-9 slump with his single.	"That was a big clutch hit," Machado said.	Ryan Tepera relieved and surrendered a two-run double to Machado.	O'Day (3-0) worked one inning for the win. Zach Britton gave up Jose Bautista's RBI single in the bottom of the ninth but held on for his 19th save.	Toronto fell short of matching the longest home winning streak in club history. The Blue Jays won 10 straight at Exhibition Stadium in 1985.	The Orioles took 1-0 lead in the first on Adam Jones' grounder. Toronto tied it in the bottom half when Jose Reyes doubled and scored on Edwin Encarnacion's sacrifice fly.	Martin was hit by a pitch to begin the second, advanced to third on Navarro's single and scored on Kevin Gausman's wild pitch.	Gausman was activated off the disabled list to make his first start of the season and his first appearance since May 6. He allowed two runs and four hits in five innings.	"It was awesome for me, even just warming up thinking about it. It's only been a month and a half and it feels like it's been forever."	Toronto's Mark Buehrle came in 3-0 with a 3.50 ERA in three starts against the Orioles this season. He allowed two runs and six hits in seven innings.	"I wasn't as sharp as I've been my last four or five outings," Buehrle said.	After Flaherty's leadoff single in the third, Buehrle retired 10 straight before Baltimore tied it in the sixth. Machado singled, Snider hit a ground rule double and Jones was intentionally walked before Delmon Young hit a sacrifice fly.	SHUFFLING BIRDS	Besides activating Gausman, the Orioles also selected RHP Mychal Givens from Double-A Bowie, optioned RHPs Tyler Wilson and Mike Wright to Triple-A Norfolk and transferred RHP Jason Garcia (right shoulder) to the 60-day DL. Givens, a converted shortstop, was 3-1 with a 1.60 ERA and 12 saves in 23 games at Bowie.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: An MRI on RHP prospect Dylan Bundy (right shoulder) showed no significant decrease in inflammation and he will remain inactive. Bundy, who is at Double-A Bowie, has not pitched since May 21.	UP NEXT	Orioles: RHP Chris Tillman (5-7, 5.58) has won his past three decisions after losing the previous six. He's 0-3 with a 12.51 ERA against Toronto this season.	Blue Jays: RHP Scott Copeland (1-1, 2.57) makes his third start in place of RHP Aaron Sanchez (strained back muscle). Copeland was drafted by Baltimore in 2010 but released in 2012 before signing with the Blue Jays.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CHICAGO --  Carlos Rodon pitched six effective innings and the Chicago White Sox snapped a season-worst eight-game losing streak, beating the Texas Rangers 3-2 on Saturday.	The White Sox scored more than two runs for the first time in seven games. Adam Eaton had two singles and scored a run.	Rodon (3-1) gave up two runs and four hits, striking out five and walking three. He bounced back after giving up seven runs in 3 2/3 innings against Pittsburgh in his last start.	David Robertson pitched the ninth for his 14th save in 18 chances. On Friday night, he allowed two runs in the ninth of a 2-1 loss to the Rangers.	Nick Martinez (5-3) gave up two earned runs in six innings. He gave up seven runs in 3 1/3 innings in his last start against Chicago on June 3.	Chicago avoided losing nine consecutive games for the first time since 2013.	The Rangers struck out 11 times after fanning 16 times on Friday night. White Sox relievers Zach Putnam and Zach Duke combined to strike out five straight during the seventh and eighth innings.	The struggling White Sox offense caught a break in the third. After three straight singles, Adam LaRoche's sacrifice fly put Chicago ahead. Melky Cabrera was hit by a pitch to load the bases before Alexei Ramirez hit a groundball that bounced past shortstop Elvis Andrus for an error to allow two runs to score.	Texas closed to 3-2 in the fifth. Carlos Corporan hit an RBI single and Rougned Odor beat out a double play to allow another run to score.	Chicago had other chances to score. The White Sox left the bases loaded in the fifth when Carlos Sanchez grounded out.	Ramirez grounded out with the bases loaded to end the first. Earlier in the inning, there was a delay of 3 1-2 minutes to determine if Cabrera was hit by a pitch.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: OF Josh Hamilton (hamstring) is expected to work out at Double-A Frisco on Sunday, then take Monday off before he works out with the Rangers on Tuesday in Arlington.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Starlin Castro walked out of Target Field on Friday night with his head hanging following another rough day at shortstop.	Less than 24 hours later, he was feeling a lot better.	Castro atoned for a costly error the previous night with a two-run single in the in the 10th inning on Saturday, helping the Chicago Cubs to a 4-1 victory over the Minnesota Twins.	Castro's error and subsequent pouting at shortstop in the first inning on Friday night got the Twins rolling to a 7-2 victory. But he ripped a one-out pitch from Blaine Boyer (2-3) into center field to break a 1-1 tie, and then made a leaping grab of a liner from Brian Dozier for the final out of the game.	"Every day is a new day," Castro said. "Try to keep it going, keep the head up and try to help the team win."	Jon Lester allowed one run in 6 1/3 innings for the Cubs, and Anthony Rizzo had two hits and an RBI. Jason Motte (4-1) pitched a scoreless inning for the win and Hector Rondon picked up his 12th save in 15 chances.	Chicago improved to 7-3 in extra-inning games this season.	Trevor May gave up one run in six innings for Minnesota, which had won three in a row. Kurt Suzuki connected for this third homer.	Cubs manager Joe Maddon said before the game he was not considering a position change for Castro, who has 14 errors this season. He compounded his latest one on Friday when he was sulking after the ball went right through his legs. He retrieved the ball and stared at it in frustration while Eddie Rosario hustled home, prompting an incredulous look from starter Kyle Hendricks.	Castro apologized after the game and took the blame for the loss, then looked to be pressing early on Saturday. He singled off May in the fourth, but slammed his bat in frustration after striking out in the sixth.	"I know I'm better than that," Castro said. "Keep my focus all game and try to make every play."	He got another chance in the 10th and delivered, pumping his fist and shouting at first base. Chris Denorfia followed two batters later with an RBI single for a little more breathing room.	"I was really happy and pleased for him and for us," Maddon said. "There was no residue from yesterday. He fielded his position really well today. ... He's done pretty well over the last week or so."	The clutch hitting came after the Cubs squandered two chances for big innings earlier in the game and ensured that a strong start from Lester would not go to waste.	Suzuki put Minnesota in front in the second inning, driving a 93-mph fastball 410 feet into the seats in left. It was the 10th homer of the year allowed by Lester, which is tied with Travis Wood for the most on the team.	"They had a lot of bases runners today, it seemed like," manager Paul Molitor said of the Cubs. "And they finally capitalized there."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: OF Jorge Soler was still favoring his sprained left ankle during batting practice on Saturday, Maddon said. But Soler did some light running and could start a rehab assignment early next week.	Twins: INF Eduardo Nunez was given the day off after he was hit in the hands by a pitch on Friday night. Molitor said Nunez was available but still sore.	UP NEXT	RHP Kyle Gibson (4-5, 3.33 ERA) starts the series finale for the Twins against RHP Jake Arrieta (6-5, 3.40 ERA). In eight home starts this season, Gibson is 3-2 with a 2.84 ERA. Arrieta is coming off of a rough start in which he walked a career-high six while giving up five runs in four innings.	LESTER'S ANGST	After giving up the homer to Suzuki, Lester retired 10 in a row. He was cruising so well that he admitted to being surprised when Maddon came to get him in the seventh.	"That's just kind of the way I've always been," Lester said. "I don't want to leave games. You feel like you always have more. But that's why you have managers and pitching coaches, to make those decisions for you. I may not be happy at the time, but I'll never second-guess a manager and what they're trying to do."	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  Jesse Hahn's hopes of closing out the eighth inning ended when he walked Angels slugger Mike Trout on six pitches.	It was about the only thing the Oakland right-hander didn't finish -- a much-needed break for the Athletics' weary bullpen.	Hahn pitched into the eighth inning for his third consecutive win, Josh Reddick hit a tiebreaking double in the sixth and the Oakland Athletics beat the Los Angeles Angels 4-1 on Saturday afternoon despite committing their majors-leading 70th error.	"On a day when we probably didn't have a few guys available down there, and after last night, we needed our starter to go deep in the game and hold them down," A's manager Bob Melvin said. "He did every bit of that."	Hahn (5-5) allowed one run and four hits in 7 2/3 innings. He struck out four and walked four while winning for the first time in six starts this season against teams from the AL West.	That allowed Melvin to avoid going to his bullpen after using five relievers in the final three innings of a 12-7 loss.	"I was hoping I could finish the eighth there," Hahn said. "That's my fault for walking him, but that was good to get into the eighth there and let our pen rest a little bit."	Hahn labored early and had to pitch out of jams early when the Angels put two runners in scoring position with two outs in both the second and third. He settled down to retire eight straight until Los Angeles scored in the sixth.	The A's, who committed four errors in Friday night's loss, backed Hahn with mostly solid defense. Left fielder Ben Zobrist made a sliding catch of Matt Joyce's short fly to left in the fourth, and Marcus Semien -- who leads the majors with 22 errors -- turned a pair of double plays.	One day after blowing a five-run lead with ace Sonny Gray on the mound in a 12-7 loss, the A's pounded out five doubles -- three in the three-run sixth.	Rookie Billy Burns had two infield hits to raise his AL-leading mark to 21 while Stephen Vogt added three hits for Oakland, which won for only the second time in the last seven games between the two teams.	Tyler Clippard retired four batters for his 11th save.	The A's went into the game having committed 13 more errors than any other team in the majors but played well behind Hahn until third baseman Brett Lawrie bounced a throw to first baseman Ike Davis in the eighth.	Oakland took a 1-0 lead in the first on back-to-back doubles by Marcus Semien and Vogt.	Los Angeles tied it on Erick Aybar's RBI single in the sixth.	Reddick, mired in a 3-for-27 funk, doubled down the left field line in the sixth to drive in Ben Zobrist with the go-ahead run. Lawrie followed with a two-out double to make it 3-1 and chase Angels starter Jered Weaver.	Weaver (4-8) allowed four runs on six hits with four strikeouts and one walk. The right-hander has lost his last four starts.	"There's no doubt he wasn't as crisp today as he has been before," Los Angeles manager Mike Scioscia said. "Just trying to get a fastball in to some decent zones has been a challenge for him the last couple times. It was this afternoon."	Josh Phegley hit the first pitch from reliever Cam Bedrosian down the third base line for another RBI double.	BURNS RED HOT	With leadoff hitter Coco Crisp having missed much of the season with a variety of injuries, Billy Burns has turned out to be more than an adequate replacement. Burns has an 11-game hitting streak, has hit safely in 23 of the last 24 and went into the day leading AL rookies in hits, stolen bases and multi-hit games.	"It's tough to even describe how important he's been for us," Melvin said. "(Crisp), that's a guy we not only rely on to be our leadoff guy and hold down that position but a guy that got clutch hits for us, he stole bases for us. Billy's doing all that."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: RHP Mike Morin (left oblique strain) will begin a rehab assignment Monday in Arizona. Morin has been on the disabled list since May 24.	Athletics: Davis (quad strain) started for the second straight game since coming off the disabled list but left for a pinch-hitter in the seventh.	UP NEXT	Angels: RHP Garrett Richards (7-4), who pitches the series finale Sunday, has allowed just two earned runs over his last 14 innings after getting shelled in his start against the New York Yankees on June 6 when he gave up six runs while retiring just two batters.	Athletics: LHP Scott Kazmir (3-4) has a 1.27 ERA at home this season and a 4.20 mark on the road.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

Max Scherzer joins SportsCenter to talk about his first career no-hitter in the Nationals' 6-0 win over the Pirates and Jose Tabata's being hit by a pitch in the ninth inning. (4:46)	WASHINGTON -- Just one strike from a perfect game, Max Scherzer saw it slip away with a misplaced slider. Or, some thought, a misplaced elbow.	Scherzer lost his bid in agonizing fashion, plunking a batter with two outs in the ninth inning before finishing off a no-hitter Saturday in the Washington Nationals' 6-0 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates.	A letdown? Yeah, a little.	"I mean there is, just because you're so close, one strike away from a perfect game," Scherzer said. "But to get a no-hitter in front of these fans, there's nothing better."	Pinch hitter Jose Tabata was all that stood between Scherzer and pitching's ultimate achievement. Tabata fouled off three 2-2 deliveries, then seemed to slightly drop his left elbow and got nicked.	Scherzer grimaced as the ball ricocheted to the ground. The crowd at Nationals Park seemed stunned, too, and surely many wondered whether Tabata leaned into the 86 mph pitch with his elbow protector to get hit.	Scherzer refused to say Tabata leaned in.	"It was a slider that just backed up, and it hit him. I don't blame him for doing it," Scherzer said on SportsCenter. "I mean, heck, I'd probably do the same thing. So it was just a pitch that got away from me, and it hit him. And then I just recuperate and just focus on getting the next guy, and I was able to do that.	"I haven't seen [the replay] but when I released [the pitch] -- and I could see once I looked up where the location was on it -- I knew I had left it in," Scherzer said. "And that's just part of baseball. Those things happen."	Tabata also said the pitch was in.	"He tried to throw me a slider inside," Tabata said. "The slider, no breaking. I stayed right there, and it got me."	"That's my job. I got to get on base whatever the situation," he added.	Nationals catcher Wilson Ramos had a different view.	"His elbow was a little bit in the strike zone. That's what I saw in the videos. But it's happened," he said.	Scherzer came within one strike of throwing the 22nd perfect major league game since 1900. It was the 13th time a perfect game was broken up with two outs in the ninth inning and the first since George Wiltse in 1908 to happen on a hit by pitch.	If anything, Scherzer's teammates seemed to take it harder than he did.	"I got down into a squat and just, I don't know, I wanted to cry," right fielder Bryce Harper said. "To be able to see a perfect game, be a part of that, would've been awesome."	Said Nationals manager Matt Williams: "He hit him with the baseball. It's difficult when that happens."	As to whether he thought about discussing the play with plate umpire Mike Muchlinski, Williams said, "I think that's irrelevant at this point. The last thing I'm going to do is walk onto the field and mess up Maxie's rhythm. That would be a crying shame. I ain't doing that."	Scherzer (8-5) retired Josh Harrison on a deep fly to left for the final out and was swallowed up by jubilant Nationals near the mound.	"Pretty easy to do," Scherzer said of keeping his cool. "Probably took two seconds. I realized I lost the perfect game. You just move on. Finish this thing out."	The 30-year-old righty struck out 10 in his second straight dominant performance and was cheered by a crowd of 41,104.	Scherzer got help from his infield in the late innings.	In the eighth, shifted second baseman Danny Espinosa barely threw out Pedro Alvarez from shallow right field to end the inning.	"I got to that ball and just knew I had to get rid of it quick," Espinosa said. "I was able to get him."	Leading off the ninth, third baseman Anthony Rendon ran hard to catch a foul pop by Gregory Polanco and wound up bent over the dugout railing.	In his previous start, Scherzer took a perfect game into the seventh at Milwaukee and finished with a one-hitter and 16 strikeouts. The lone hit was a leadoff single by Carlos Gomez just beyond the reach of Rendon, who was playing second base.	Scherzer is the fifth pitcher -- and first since 1944 -- to allow one hit or fewer over two consecutive complete games, turning in perhaps the most magnificent consecutive starts in the majors since Johnny Vander Meer pitched back-to-back no-hitters for Cincinnati in 1938.	Scherzer threw his third career shutout. He had one in 210 career starts before these two in a row.	"My last few starts, this is some of the best baseball I've thrown," he said.	Signed to a seven-year, $210 million contract in the offseason after leaving Detroit, the 2013 American League Cy Young winner pitched the second no-hitter in Nationals' history. Jordan Zimmermann threw one against the Marlins last year to end the regular season.	"He's just an unbelievable pitcher, unbelievable clubhouse guy, and he's worth every penny he gets," Harper said.	It was the fourth no-hitter in the city's baseball history. Walter Johnson and Bob Burke threw them for the old Washington Senators.	This was the second no-hitter of the season -- San Francisco rookie Chris Heston did it June 9 against the Mets -- and the 11th straight no-hitter thrown by a National League pitcher; Felix Hernandez last threw one for the AL in August 2012.	Scherzer threw 106 pitches, 82 for strikes. He was throwing fastballs in the upper 90s and used a wicked slider in lowering his ERA to 1.76.	The Pirates twice hit balls to the warning track in his first time through the order.	Harper hit his 23rd homer and drove in two runs. He had missed two games after straining his hamstring.	Francisco Liriano (4-6) took the loss.	UP NEXT	Pirates RHP Charlie Morton (5-0, 1.62 ERA) has won all of his starts this season. He will pitch Sunday against Gio Gonzalez (4-4, 4.82).	Scherzer's next scheduled start is Friday against the Philadelphia Phillies, who have the lowest batting average in the NL and are 14-for-81 (.173) in three games against him this season.	BLANKED BUCS	This was the sixth no-hitter versus the Pirates and the first since Homer Bailey did it for the Reds in 2012.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: Polanco returned to the lineup Saturday. He left Friday night's game in the seventh inning after banging into the right-field wall trying to make a catch. "I think the wind got knocked out of him, which caught his attention more than anything," manager Clint Hurdle said. ... 2B Neil Walker missed his third consecutive game with a stomach illness.	Nationals: INF Yunel Escobar was a late scratch from the lineup with a stomach illness. ... Williams said RHP Stephen Strasburg (neck tightness) could return to the Nationals' rotation following his Saturday bullpen session. Strasburg threw 71 pitches in a Double-A rehab start Wednesday night followed by nine more in the bullpen. "There's no reason he couldn't go to 95 [pitches] and get in a big league game and do that," Williams said. "We'll have to see about his health, though."	The Associated Press and ESPN Stats & Information contributed to this report.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DENVER --  Chad Bettis gave the Colorado Rockies the start they wanted while Charlie Blackmon provided the offense they needed.	Bettis pitched effectively into the seventh inning, Blackmon homered and drove in three runs and the Rockies snapped a five-game losing streak with a 5-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers on Saturday.	Colorado had lost nine of its last 10 before getting a strong outing from Bettis (3-2), who got his first win since carrying a no-hitter into the eighth inning at Philadelphia on May 29. He allowed one run and five hits, walked two and struck out five in 6 1/3 innings.	He got a big assist from reliever Tommy Kahnle, who got an inning-ending double play in the seventh with runners at the corners.	"I had to save Chad runs, make sure they don't score," Kahnle said. "That was pretty much my job. I got the ground ball we needed and got the job done."	Bettis allowed five runs in the first two innings against Houston on Monday before shutting down the Astros in his final three innings. He used that finish as a starting point for Saturday.	"I felt I had really good stuff that day and wanted to build off that," he said. "I didn't want to go completely back to the whiteboard and rewrite everything. Working on the side in between the starts was productive."	Bettis got the Rockies off to a good start by holding Milwaukee scoreless until the sixth. It was the first time in six games a Colorado opponent didn't score in the first inning.	The offense, which hit .215 in the previous 10 games, gave Bettis enough support to get the win.	Nolan Arenado led off the second with a double, moved to third on a groundout and scored on Michael McKenry's sacrifice fly to make it 1-0.	Blackmon made it 3-0 with a two-run homer off Kyle Lohse in the fifth, his ninth of the season and just his second in June. He has five extra-base hits in his last four games.	"I wasn't looking for anything in particular," Blackmon said. "I just know going up there and trying to hit the ball as hard as you could probably was not the best thing to do. I was ready for anything."	Adam Lind got a run back in the sixth with a two-out home run off Bettis. It was Lind's 10th of the season and cut the deficit to 3-1.	The Brewers mounted a rally in the seventh when Hernan Perez reached on a one-out double, went to third on a wild pitch and Martin Maldonado walked. Kahnle relieved Bettis and got pinch-hitter Jonathan Lucroy to hit a double play started by Arenado at third.	"That was a tough double play," Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. "Tough ball for Nolan and (second baseman) DJ (LeMahieu) hung in there. DJ's tough as nails and turned a difficult double play."	Colorado made it 5-1 in the seventh off reliever Michael Blazek on RBI singles by Ben Paulsen and Blackmon to get some breathing room heading into the last two innings.	"A 5-1 lead in the ninth is better than a 3-1 lead," Blackmon said. "We should have won that game with the start (Bettis) gave us, especially the way Kahnle came in and got that double play right away. Those guys did a great job."	Lohse (3-9) had his best outing in a month but is 0-5 with a 7.59 ERA in his last seven starts. He has not won since tossing eight shutout innings against the New York Mets on May 15.	"It's frustrating to lose a ballgame, but I try to look at the positives," Lohse said. "I found a lot personally out of that outing today."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: RHP Wily Peralta (strained left oblique) has started throwing but has not been on the mound. Manager Craig Counsell said Peralta should start throwing from the mound next week. ... OF Khris Davis (torn meniscus in right knee) will start swinging a bat in the next "couple of days," Counsell said. Counsell said it's the last step in his recovery.	Rockies: Reliever Rafael Betancourt (vertigo symptoms) will pitch Sunday in a rehab assignment with Triple-A Albuquerque. Weiss said Betancourt would need just one outing, two at the most, before he's ready. ... 1B Justin Morneau (concussion symptoms) has begun off-field activities but there is no timetable for his return.	UP NEXT	Brewers: RHP Matt Garza (4-8, 5.07) is 2-4 with a 5.25 ERA in six career starts against Colorado. He was the pitcher of record in a 5-2 loss to the Rockies on April 7.	Rockies: LHP Chris Rusin (2-2, 5.14) has allowed 13 earned runs and 20 hits in his last two starts. His ERA has risen 3.69 in that span.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PHILADELPHIA --  The Cardinals seem to have gotten a hitting bug in Philadelphia.	Randal Grichuk hit two home runs, doubled and drove in four runs, and John Lackey pitched seven strong innings to lead the St. Louis Cardinals to a 10-1 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Saturday night.	Jason Heyward had three hits with a double and two RBI, Jhonny Peralta had three singles with an RBI, and Yadier Molina singled, doubled and drove in a run for the Cardinals, who won their seventh in nine games while beating Philadelphia for the fifth straight time. The Cardinals pounded out 16 hits, tying their season-high set in Friday's 12-4 win over Philadelphia.	"Hitting is contagious," Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said. "I've seen real good at-bats. It's probably the first time this year we've had this much hitting. We're fortunate that we have a lineup that guys know their roles."	Lackey (6-4) allowed one run on five hits to earn his first victory on the road this season away from Busch Stadium. He entered 0-3 with a 6.27 ERA in six road starts.	"I thought I pitched pretty good," Lackey said. "I was locating my fastball well."	Cody Asche homered for the Phillies, who have lost 11 of 12.	"These aren't fun games," Asche said of the last two losses.	Aaron Harang (4-9) lost his sixth straight start for the first time in his career, giving up four runs on seven hits in six innings. Harang struck out six and walked one. The right-hander dropped to 7-17 in 29 career starts against St. Louis.	Phillies starters extended their club-record winless streak to 25 games. The last win for a Philadelphia starter came on May 23. Since then, they are 0-16 with a 5.97 ERA.	Harang said it might be a matter of pitchers trying to do too much.	"Sometimes when you're going out there, you're trying to executive that perfect pitch and you try to put too much pressure on yourself," he said. "That's where it hurts."	Grichuk sent Harang to the defeat with a 427-foot drive in the sixth inning. After Heyward and Molina singled leading off the frame, Grichuk drove them in by belting his fifth homer of season deep into the Phillies bullpen in center field.	"I'm going up there being aggressive, trusting my abilities and just reacting," Grichuk said.	Philadelphia had taken a 1-0 in the second on Asche's solo shot to right.	But Lackey limited the Phillies to just four hits over the next 5 1/3 scoreless innings.	The Cardinals tied it in the fourth on Molina's RBI double to left field. Peralta scored from first when Asche misplayed the ball in left field, thinking it was going to carom off the railing down the line before watching it carry to the corner.	Heyward's two-run double highlighted St. Louis' four-run eighth inning. The runs were charged to Seth Rosin, who was making his Phillies debut after being called up from Triple-A Lehigh Valley in place of right-hander Phillippe Aumont. He was designated for assignment after allowing six runs in four innings on Friday.	Grichuk led off the ninth with a solo shot to left off Rosin, marking his first multi-homer game of his career. He also homered on Friday.	TOUGH DEBUT	Rosin ended up with a 22.50 ERA on the evening after allowing five runs on seven hits in two innings. In a somber clubhouse afterward, Rosin sat slumped at his locker with his head in his hands for several minutes.	STREAKING MOLINA	Molina extended his hitting streak to seven games. He is batting .462 with two homers and four RBI during the streak.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: RHP Lance Lynn, on the DL since June 8, threw a bullpen session on Saturday to test his right forearm strain. The Cardinals will assess Lynn's condition on Sunday, and then determine when he might be able to return to the rotation.	UP NEXT	Cardinals: RHP Michael Wacha (9-2, 2.48) looks to continue his road success when he takes the mound for the series finale Sunday afternoon. Wacha is 6-1 with a 2.08 ERA in eight road starts this season.	Phillies: LHP Adam Morgan will make his big-league debut on Sunday, filling in for injured No. 3 starter Jerome Williams (left hamstring strain). Morgan was winless in 13 starts at Triple-A Lehigh Valley, going 0-6 with a 4.74 ERA.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

CLEVELAND --  Evan Longoria's sore left wrist looked just fine Saturday night.	Longoria hit a three-run homer in the first inning off reigning Cy Young winner Corey Kluber and led the Tampa Bay Rays to their fourth straight win, a 4-1 victory over the Cleveland Indians.	Not only did the Rays win for the eighth time in nine games, they improved to a season-high 10 games over .500 (40-30). Tampa Bay also sent Kluber (3-9) to his fourth straight loss.	Longoria, who hit his first home run since June 10, acknowledged that the wrist has prevented him from taking extra hitting practice.	"I always say we all feel this stuff," he said. "It's taken me out of my routine a little bit, but once I get into the game, I feel OK. I felt good tonight."	Rays starter Erasmo Ramirez left in the fourth inning with a groin injury. Five relievers completed the victory, holding Cleveland to six hits. Xavier Cedeno (1-0) replaced Ramirez and completed the fourth.	Brad Boxberger allowed two hits and a walk to load the bases in the ninth, but struck out rookie Giovanny Urshela to end the game for his 18th save.	Rays manager Kevin Cash knows Longoria is hurting, but is impressed with how the three-time All-Star stays in the lineup.	"It's huge," Cash said. "Even when he's not 100 percent, he's one of our best. Not to say it's not bothering him. It's definitely affecting him."	Kevin Kiermaier drew a leadoff walk in the first and took third on Joey Butler's hit-and-run single to right. Longoria followed with his seventh homer of the season.	"Obviously a leadoff walk's no good," Kluber said. "Just didn't really execute the pitch to Longoria. We were trying to go fastball in and it just kind of stayed over the middle."	Kluber allowed four runs and four hits in seven innings. Tampa Bay scored again in the third, but the right-hander didn't give up another hit over his final four innings.	Kluber, who was 18-9 last season with a 2.44 ERA, hasn't won since May 28. He has a 3.65 ERA this season, but the Indians have scored a total of six runs in his last four starts.	Ramirez was 6-2 going into the game and had won four consecutive starts.	After Jason Kipnis led off the fourth with a single, Ramirez bent over in pain after throwing a 1-1 pitch for a ball to Francisco Lindor. Cash and a trainer went to the mound and Ramirez was pulled.	Ramirez didn't give up a run, struck out three and walked none in three-plus innings.	"We don't quite know the severity of it," Cash said. "So far, we're hearing good things that maybe we caught it early enough so we'll see the next couple of days how he responds to treatment."	Kipnis finished 2 for 3, extending his hitting streak to 15 games.	STRONG WORK	Tampa Bay's bullpen leads the majors with 238 2/3 innings pitched. Right-hander Steve Geltz struck out two in the seventh Saturday and has retired 25 consecutive batters. The bullpen has allowed one run in 20 2/3 innings during the winning streak.	"It's amazing what those guys have done thus far in the season," Cash said, "and tonight is another perfect example."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: LHP Matt Moore (Tommy John surgery) will make a rehab start Sunday for Triple-A Durham. He made three starts for Single-A Charlotte.	Indians: C Yan Gomes returned to the lineup after not playing Friday because of a stiff neck. He was hitless in three at-bats.	UP NEXT	Rays: RHP Alex Colome lasted two innings, the shortest outing of his career, Tuesday against Washington. Tampa Bay has lost each of his last five starts since he beat Oakland on May 21.	Indians: RHP Cody Anderson will make his major league debut against the Rays. Anderson has made 13 starts at Double-Akron and Triple-A Columbus, going 4-3 with a 1.89 ERA.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  It was another successful birthday for Kendrys Morales.	The slugger hit his third career homer on his birthday, and the Kansas City Royals rallied to beat the Boston Red Sox 7-4 on Saturday night.	Morales connected for a tiebreaking two-run shot in Kansas City's five-run fifth against Rick Porcello (4-8). It was the eighth homer of the season for the designated hitter, who turned 32 on Saturday.	"We're bringing him a cake and candles tomorrow, make like it didn't happen, and let him do it again," said Mike Moustakas, who had two hits and two RBI for Kansas City.	Morales powered a 1-0 sinker over the wall in right, driving in Lorenzo Cain.	"Jeremy Guthrie began to yell in the dugout, `birthday home run, birthday home run," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "For him to do it three times on his birthday is special."	The Red Sox lost third baseman Pablo Sandoval (sprained left ankle) and catcher Blake Swihart (sprained left foot) to injuries. Sandoval was in a walking boot after the game.	"Both are day to day," manager John Farrell said. "We'll check them when they come in in the morning. It's undetermined right now if we're going to need to make a (roster) move. They both had X-rays here at the ballpark. Blake's is at the base of the fifth toe. There were no fractures there. There was nothing structurally, bone-wise, with Pablo either."	Red Sox designated hitter David Ortiz was ejected in the seventh inning by plate umpire Bruce Dreckman.	"All I have to say is this situation between players and umpires is getting to the ridiculous point," Ortiz said. "It seems to me that it's more of a feeling than reality. I'm an 18-year veteran in this league. When I was coming up, it seems like you would get respect for that. It doesn't work that way anymore. In my house, I was (taught) that if you don't respect me I don't have to respect you. That's how I am."	The Red Sox scored two runs in the fifth to take a 4-1 lead, but Porcello fell apart in the bottom half with a hit batter, a balk, a walk and four hits.	Porcello was charged with six runs and eight hits in five innings. The right-hander is 0-6 with a 7.50 ERA in his last six starts.	Sandoval committed a throwing error in the inning when he hurt his ankle. Swihart was hit for in the sixth after injuring his left foot on a slide into third base the previous inning.	Salvador Perez hit his fifth home run in 12 games for the Royals.	Boston's Mookie Betts led off the game with a home run, extending his hitting streak to eight games.	Right-hander Edinson Volquez (7-4) allowed four runs, eight hits and two walks in 5 1/3 innings, but won his third straight start.	"I made mistakes when I was ahead in the count," Volquez said.	Greg Holland worked the ninth for his 13th save in 14 opportunities.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: 2B Dustin Pedroia (sore left knee) returned to the lineup after missing the previous two games. He hit third and was 0 for 5.	Royals: LHP Danny Duffy (biceps tendinitis) will come off the disabled list on Wednesday to start at Seattle.	UP NEXT	Red Sox: LHP Wade Miley (6-6) starts the series finale on Sunday. He yielded a career-high 10 earned runs in 4 2/3 innings in an Aug. 5, 2014, start against the Royals while with the Diamondbacks.	Royals: RHP Chris Young (6-2) is 4-1 with a 2.42 ERA in six home games this season.	PINO OPTIONED	Kansas City RHP Yohan Pino gave up six runs in 5 1/3 innings Friday in a loss to the Red Sox and was optioned Saturday to Triple-A Omaha. The Royals recalled RHP Aaron Brooks, who will be used in long relief. Brooks was 4-3 with a 3.42 ERA with Omaha.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ATLANTA --  Andrelton Simmons got four hits for the Atlanta Braves in a 6-4 win Saturday night over the New York Mets 6-4, who lost their fourth in a row and catcher Travis d'Arnaud to an elbow injury.	A.J. Pierzynski tripled, doubled and singled. He scored standing up on Pedro Ciriaco's tiebreaking sacrifice fly in the sixth inning, and his left leg appeared to hit d'Arnaud's left arm.	The Mets said d'Arnaud is day to day with a hyperextended left elbow. D'Arnaud, who homered and hit a two-run single earlier in the game, returned 10 days earlier from the disabled list after missing seven weeks with a broken right hand.	Williams Perez (4-0) allowed four runs on five hits in six innings.	Jason Grilli pitched around Wilmer Flores' two-out single in the ninth for his 20th save in 22 chances.	Jack Leathersich (0-1) lost in relief.	---	This story has been corrected to show that Grilli earned his 20th save in 22 chances for the Braves.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

CINCINNATI --  Justin Nicolino's major league debut was a smashing success.	Nicolino pitched seven innings of four-hit ball, Derek Dietrich homered twice and the Miami Marlins snapped a three-game losing streak with a 5-0 victory over the Cincinnati Reds on Saturday night	Nicolino became the first pitcher in franchise history to throw seven shutout innings in his major league debut, according to manager Dan Jennings.	"There've been some great arms come through this organization," Jennings said. "For a guy making his major league debut in this ballpark, his composure and presence were tremendous."	Nicolino, 23, walked two and struck out two while outpitching Anthony DeSclafani, his former roommate in the Miami organization.	"It's one of those things that's indescribable," Nicolino said. "I just wanted to go out and give us a chance to win. It's one of those games where you just take everything in and enjoy it."	Nicolino was recalled from Triple-A New Orleans to start in place of right-hander Tom Koehler, who was scratched with back and neck soreness.	The Reds got just one runner past second base against Nicolino and relievers Carter Capps and A.J. Ramos while being shut out for the fifth time this season.	"That's crazy," DeSclafani said of his former teammate in the Toronto and Miami systems. "I'm happy for him. I know how hard he's worked."	The Marlins went hitless through the first three innings for the fourth consecutive game before Dietrich launched his second homer of the season 439 feet into the seats in right. The homer snapped an 0-for-8 slump by Dietrich.	Miami added two more runs in the inning. Justin Bour had a run-scoring groundout before J.T. Realmuto lined an RBI double over Marlon Byrd's head in left field.	DeSclafani (5-5) needed 33 pitches to get through the fourth after throwing a total of 37 while facing 10 batters through the first three. He lasted five innings, allowing three runs and four hits with three walks and three strikeouts. He also hit a batter.	Dietrich added a two-run homer off Manny Parra in the seventh for his first career multihomer game. Parra had retired 21 consecutive batters since coming off the disabled list on May 25 before being greeted by Dee Gordon's double and Dietrich's 342-foot line drive down the right-field line.	"Dietrich gave us the power," Jennings said. "It was huge to hit the ball the way he did. He got the head out and made the most of it."	STAT!	Reds C Devin Mesoraco is scheduled to have surgery on June 29 in New York City to repair his left hip impingement. Mesoraco, a 2014 All-Star, hasn't caught since April 12 and has been on the disabled list since May 25. He is expected to be ready for spring training.	SPINNING TURNSTILES	The Reds' Saturday crowd of 36,755 pushed the team's total to 1,005,710 in the 33rd home date, the fastest the franchise has reached seven figures in the 13-year history of Great American Ball Park.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: RHP Bryan Morris, on the DL with a lower back strain, is expected to pitch a couple of innings Sunday for Single-A Jupiter on a rehab assignment, Jennings said.	Reds: RHP Raisel Iglesias (strained left oblique) and LHP Tony Cingrani (strained left shoulder), both on the DL, could be back before the All-Star break, manager Bryan Price said.	UP NEXT	Marlins: RHP David Phelps (4-3) hopes to extend his hot streak when he starts the finale of the three-game series on Sunday. Phelps is 2-0 with a 1.20 ERA in his last two starts, both at home against Colorado and the Yankees.	Reds: Rookie RHP Michael Lorenzen (2-2) will try to win consecutive starts for the first time. The appearance will be his first against the Marlins.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

NEW YORK -- Some of the old-timers out there were right around Alex Rodriguez's age. Hard to believe these days.	Rodriguez added to his momentous weekend with a homer and five RBIs, Carlos Beltran went deep from both sides of the plate, and the New York Yankees routed the Detroit Tigers 14-3 on Saturday night.	"It was a wonderful day," manager Joe Girardi said.	Light-hitting Didi Gregorius homered for the second consecutive game, and New York banged out a season-best 18 hits on Old-Timers' Day at Yankee Stadium. With former greats from Whitey Ford to Rickey Henderson on hand, the team presented Willie Randolph with a Monument Park plaque and surprised Mel Stottlemyre with one of his own.	"I always enjoy this day," outfielder Brett Gardner said. "Those guys really set the stage for what we have here at the stadium."	Gardner tripled, doubled and singled his first three times up against Alfredo Simon (7-4), sparking the Yankees to a laugher from his leadoff spot. He also made an outstanding catch at the fence in right-center.	"Gardy had an unbelievable night. He set the tone," catcher Brian McCann said. "I don't know if anybody's had the cycle in the fourth inning."	Chris Young homered off backup infielder Josh Wilson in the eighth and finished with three hits.	One night after he homered for his 3,000th hit with his daughters in the stands and later drank a champagne toast with teammates, Rodriguez was at it again. The three-time MVP, who turns 40 next month, drove in a run with a sharp grounder in the first, hit a sacrifice fly in the second and launched a three-run homer off reliever Ian Krol in the third to make it 8-0.	"I just think he's thriving on being back in the game, something that was taken away," Girardi said, referring to A-Rod's season-long drug suspension last year.	Gardner said it has been a lot of fun for the Yankees to watch Rodriguez this season.	"I hope he's enjoying it. I would be enjoying it if I was him," Gardner said. "He's in some pretty special company."	Beltran drove in three runs and homered from both sides for the 12th time in his career. New York matched season highs for runs and homers (5) in winning for the 11th time in 12 home games -- the club's best such streak since 2010.	The Yankees won their fourth straight overall and improved to 12-5 in June. They handed Detroit (34-34) its fourth straight defeat.	"We got our butts whooped. Not much to it," said manager Brad Ausmus, who spoke to his team after the game. "You're going to have a couple of games like this each season."	All the offense on a misty night made things easy for Nathan Eovaldi (6-2), who rebounded from a miserable outing in Miami. Starting on three days' rest for the first time in his career after throwing only 36 pitches Tuesday against the Marlins, the right-hander took a two-hit shutout into the seventh.	Bryan Mitchell worked three innings for his first major league save before the remnants of a sellout crowd that numbered 48,092.	In his previous start, Eovaldi got only two outs and was rocked for eight runs and nine hits in a 12-2 loss.	"He was great tonight. Had all his pitches working," McCann said. "He did a lot of good things."	Wilson wasn't bad, either -- all things considered. He gave up one run and two hits in one inning.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: Looking to rest some veteran stars, Ausmus pulled Ian Kinsler, Miguel Cabrera and Yoenis Cespedes in the fifth with Detroit trailing 10-0. It was the 12th anniversary of Cabrera's major league debut with the Marlins.	Yankees: RHP Ivan Nova (Tommy John surgery) is probably ready to rejoin the rotation after making his third minor league rehab start Friday, Girardi said. He wasn't sure yet when Nova will slot in but said it's possible the team will go to a six-man rotation. ... Rookie OF Mason Williams went for an MRI after jamming his right shoulder trying to get back to first base on a pickoff play Friday night. "It popped out and popped back in. We're hoping it'll only be three or four days and he'll be back in the lineup," Girardi said.	LOOKING FOR A LONG BALL	Gardner had three chances to hit a homer for the cycle but was retired each time -- including on a fly to center by Wilson in the eighth.	"I knew," Wilson said. "It looked like he was going for it."	SPECIAL GUEST	Juventus midfielder Andrea Pirlo was at the game, a sign he is negotiating to sign with MLS's NYC team that is co-owned by the Yankees.	UP NEXT	Tigers: RHP Anibal Sanchez (5-7) starts Sunday as Detroit tries to avert a three-game sweep.	Yankees: RHP Masahiro Tanaka (4-2) has a 1.31 ERA in his past five starts.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

LOS ANGELES --  Tim Hudson and Bruce Bochy see no particular reason why the San Francisco Giants are dominating the Los Angeles Dodgers this season.	After another successful outing on another sizzling day in Chavez Ravine, the right-hander and his manager are just glad this one-sided rivalry has put the Giants in position to climb back on top of the NL West.	Justin Maxwell and Brandon Belt hit two-run homers and the Giants trimmed the Dodgers' division lead to a half-game with a 6-2 victory Saturday.	Hudson pitched six-hit ball into the seventh inning and had a key single for the Giants, who have won five straight over their archrivals and nine of 11 this season.	"It's nice to win any time here, but especially this year with such a tight race with these guys," Hudson said after his second career victory at Dodger Stadium. "Fortunately we've been able to play some good baseball against these guys when we need it. We'd love to be in first place, and we've put ourselves in a pretty good position to do that."	Los Angeles (38-31) has been alone in first place since May 30, but San Francisco (38-32) could reclaim the top spot with a series sweep Sunday.	Hudson (5-6) yielded two walks and struck out three, bouncing back after allowing back-to-back homers to Joc Pederson and Justin Turner in a rocky first inning. He singled with two outs in the fifth, allowing Maxwell to deliver the tiebreaking homer.	"He's amazing at his age to go out there on a hot day and give us an effort like that," Bochy said of the 39-year-old Hudson. "I can't explain it. We've pitched well. We've got timely hits. ... But there's a lot of baseball left. Going to be a tough division. L.A., they're the team to beat, but we're going to come in here and try to play well."	Maxwell and Belt connected against Carlos Frias (4-5), who gave up six runs and five hits. While the Giants are surging, the Dodgers have lost six of eight.	"In a big sense, it's probably going to go through those guys, and we're going to have to find a way to get it done," Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said. "We have a half-game lead in the division, but they've basically gained seven games on us in the games that we've played against them. So obviously, that's something that we have to be able to change."	The Giants went up 2-0 in the first, but Pederson put a shot deep into the visiting bullpen for his 18th homer and his first since June 3, when he homered in his fifth straight game. When Turner connected for the second straight day, the hitting-poor Dodgers had their first back-to-back homers since April 19.	Frias retired nine consecutive Giants until Hudson singled and Maxwell put a two-strike homer into the bleachers in left, snapping his 2-for-19 skid.	Belt then dropped a long fly barely over the wall in right in the sixth for his ninth homer. Right fielder Yasiel Puig could have had a shot to steal it, but lost it in the sun.	AOKI OUT	Maxwell entered the Giants' lineup in the first inning after Nori Aoki got hit in the lower leg by Frias' second pitch of the game. Aoki ran the bases and scored San Francisco's first run on Angel Pagan's sacrifice fly, but he didn't come out when the Giants took the field, sitting with a bruised leg. Aoki said he'll decide Sunday morning whether he can play.	NEW PEN	Before the game, Los Angeles recalled RHP Matt West and optioned RHP Josh Ravin. West made his Dodgers debut, finishing the game by pitching two scoreless innings. Los Angeles acquired West from Toronto last month.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Giants: Gregor Blanco moved from right field to left when Aoki got hurt. Blanco played his second game back from a DL stint with a concussion.	Dodgers: RHP Joel Peralta (right shoulder) is returning to Los Angeles after a rehab stint with Triple-A Oklahoma City.	UP NEXT	Giants: RHP Tim Lincecum (7-3, 3.31 ERA) has made it through the sixth inning just once in his last six starts at Dodger Stadium.	Dodgers: LHP Brett Anderson (2-4, 3.43 ERA) has just one win in seven starts at Chavez Ravine despite a 3.32 ERA.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SEATTLE --  Taijuan Walker has found his groove for the Seattle Mariners.	Walker struck out a career-high 11 while pitching into the seventh inning in a 6-3 win over the Houston Astros on Saturday night.	Walker (5-6) allowed three runs and five hits in 6 1/3 innings to continue a stretch of dominance in his last five starts. The 22-year-old right-hander is 4-1 with a 2.04 ERA in that span and pitched at least six innings in each of the games.	Against Houston, he most impressed himself by walking no one.	"That's the biggest thing, not giving anything away, any free passes," he said. "I felt like I was really getting ahead, and after the second inning kind of just got into a nice groove."	It's been a big shift for Walker, who started the season 1-5 with a 7.33 ERA through nine games.	"He had a great game," Seattle catcher Mike Zunino said. "It's one of those things where it just seems like everything's been building his last couple starts."	Seattle's offense also had a big night, something that hasn't happened often this season. Nelson Cruz, Seth Smith and Mark Trumbo homered for the Mariners, who have won two in a row and scored at least five runs in back-to-back games for the first time since April 19-20.	"I think it's coming," Seattle manager Lloyd McClendon said. "I think there's a lot more to be had with this offense. The last two nights have certainly been very nice."	Evan Gattis and Luis Valbuena homered for the Astros, who blew an early 2-0 lead.	Houston starter Dallas Keuchel (8-3) extended his streak of pitching at least six innings to 26 straight starts -- the longest active run in the majors -- but had his worst performance of the year. Keuchel's four walks, five earned runs, and three home runs allowed were all season highs.	Things went wrong early for Keuchel. After Gattis and Valbuena hit solo homers in the top of the second to give the Astros a 2-0 lead, Keuchel lost his control. The Mariners tied it in the bottom of the second largely due to four walks in the inning by Keuchel, two coming with the bases loaded. Keuchel hadn't given up more than three walks in any of his previous 14 starts this season, and he said he had a hard time getting a grip on the ball in the early innings.	"I just kind of lost it there in the second," Keuchel said. "I've got to figure something out, even if I can't get a grip on the ball. That's a very frustrating thing."	Carson Smith came on with two on and two outs in the eighth and closed the game, retiring all four batters he faced, for his fifth save.	YOU'RE OUT	Houston's Gattis was called out on fan interference to end the sixth inning when Seattle shortstop Brad Miller attempted to catch his foul pop-up near the seats down the left-field line. The call was held up on replay review, although Astros manager A.J. Hinch disagreed and was ejected for arguing the call. "I don't understand how you can assume a catch when a guy is running full speed from shortstop crashing into a wall," Hinch said. "To make that a guaranteed catch, I'm not sure why we wouldn't instruct all our home fans to get in the way."	LOOKING FOR A SPARK	Seattle hopes a return to the past will reinvigorate the worst hitting team in baseball, as the Mariners hired Edgar Martinez -- who played 18 years with Seattle -- as their hitting coach on Saturday and reassigned Howard Johnson to their minor league system. The Mariners entered Saturday's game with the worst batting average in the majors at .233 and ranked 28th in runs scored.	GOING YARD	The Astros have hit at least two home runs in seven straight games, a franchise record. Houston has hit 25 homers in 12 games against the Mariners this season.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Houston: 2B Jose Altuve (sore right hamstring) was out of the lineup for the third straight game.	Seattle: RHP Hisashi Iwakuma (right lat strain) made a rehab start for Class A Everett, allowing three hits and one run in 3 2/3 innings.	UP NEXT	Astros: Rookie right-hander Vince Velasquez (0-0, 4.66 ERA) will make his third career start in the final game of the three-game series with Seattle on Sunday.	Mariners: Lefty J.A. Happ (3-3, 3.79) has never lost to the Astros, as he's 3-0 in five career starts against Houston.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PHOENIX --  Tyson Ross made a couple of adjustments, one in his pitching mechanics, another in his attitude on the mound.	The result was a four-hitter, his third career complete game and an 8-1 victory for the San Diego Padres over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Saturday night.	Clint Barmes went 3-for-4 with two doubles, driving in two runs and scoring twice.	Derek Norris and Melvin Upton Jr. homered for the Padres. Upton's was his first of the season, a two-run shot off Addison Reed in the Padres' four-run ninth inning.	Ross (4-7), who matched his season high with nine strikeouts and walked one, had two complete games for San Diego last year. He also drove in a run with his first career triple, then scored on Upton's homer in the ninth.	"Today I was just trying to attack hitters and put an emphasis on getting the leadoff guy out and make them put the ball in play," Ross said. "You know I've had some troubles with command and walking guys and I just really wanted to challenge people tonight."	He had lost three of his previous four starts and walked five in his last outing.	"We made a mechanical adjustments in between starts and it carried well over into the game," Ross said, "and allowed me to execute a lot more pitches and really just get ahead of guys and put them away."	Interim manager Pat Murphy said its well established what the 6-foot-6 right-hander can do.	"We've seen it in the past," Murphy said. "He's capable of that. Nobody in the league wants to face him. I mean, you don't want to face him. He's filthy."	Arizona's Jake Lamb said Ross' slider "is one of the better ones in the game. He was on tonight and nobody was seeing it too well."	Robbie Ray (2-2) allowed four runs on six hits in 5 2/3 innings for Arizona. He struck out a career-high seven and walked two.	For the ninth time since they were 8-8 on April 24, the Diamondbacks failed in a bid to reach .500.	Matt Kemp had a single and double and scored twice for the Padres. Kemp led off the second with a double to deep center, advanced to third on a groundout and scored San Diego's first run when Barmes singled.	Norris' shot into the left field seats on Ray's 3-2 pitch with two outs in the third made it 2-0.	Kemp singled with one out in the sixth, then scored on Barmes' two-out double down the left field line. The Diamondbacks had a good chance to get Kemp at the plate but shortstop Cliff Pennington's relay throw sailed over the head of catcher Welington Castillo. Barmes took third on the errant throw and Alexi Amarista walked, ending Ray's night.	"I think it was just a lack of concentration," Ray said of his sixth inning problems. "I gave up that hit and I was mad at myself and couldn't get over it."	David Hernandez, in his fifth appearance since returning from Tommy John surgery, relieved Ray and his wild pitch allowed Barmes to score and the Padres led 4-0.	The Diamondbacks' run came when Chris Owings tripled in the seventh and scored on Castillo's double.	COACHING SHUFFLE	The Padres hired ex-major leaguer Xavier Nady as hitting coach, part of the chain reaction of personnel moves after Pat Murphy was named San Diego's interim manager. Rod Barajas moved from Elsinore hitting coach to manager at Double-A San Antonio. Jamie Quirk moved from San Antonio to Murphy's old job as manager at Triple-A El Paso. Nady played his first professional game for Elsinore.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: LHP Cory Luebke, coming back from Tommy John surgery, made his third rehab appearance Friday night, allowing a run and a hit in one inning for Class A Elsinore. It was the first hit run he had given up in the three outings.	Diamondbacks: LHP Patrick Corbin, coming off Tommy John surgery, went 5 1/3 innings for Class Double-A Mobile at Pensacola on Saturday night, his third rehab start. He allowed two runs on three hits with three walks and three strikeouts. ... 3B-OF Yasmany Tomas was out of the lineup after being hit in the elbow with a pitch Friday night. The MRI showed it was only a bruise and Tomas pinch hit late in the game.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK -- J.D. Martinez wanted that fourth home run. He had never even hit two in a major league game before, so might as well tie the record the first time he got a chance.	In his final at-bat, Martinez swung at a pitch out of the strike zone and popped up to right field. It was just about the only time he missed Sunday, when he hit three homers and drove in six runs to lead the Detroit Tigers over the New York Yankees 12-4 to snap a four-game skid.	"I definitely got anxious. I just knew that I was feeling good," Martinez said. "I don't think he threw me one strike."	Victor Martinez homered and drove in four two-out runs off Masahiro Tanaka for Detroit, outscored 21-5 in the first two games of the series.	Andrew Romine hit Jose De Paula's first major league pitch for a solo shot in the sixth.	"To be able to come back after an embarrassing night ... is big for us," Romine said of Detroit's effort only hours after losing 14-3 on Saturday.	Anibal Sanchez (6-7) lost his scoreless streak at 21 2/3 innings when Brian McCann homered with one out in the second. But the Tigers' right-hander was steady for seven innings to earn his third straight win. He yielded seven hits and three runs in handing the Yankees only their second loss in 13 home games.	J.D. Martinez connected off Tanaka (4-3) with two outs in the first. He struck out looking in the third and led off the fifth with another homer against the Japanese right-hander, who allowed three long balls for the first time in his big league career.	J.D. Martinez then went deep off Danny Burawa with two on in the sixth to give the Tigers an 11-2 lead. Burawa was making his major league debut.	"It was just one of those days where you take swings and you're actually hitting the ball how you want to hit it," J.D. Martinez said. "There's not too many of those days, so you've just got to take advantage of them."	With a chance to tie the major league record for homers in a game, he flied out to right in the eighth.	It was the first three-homer game for Detroit since Miguel Cabrera did it at Texas on May 19, 2013.	J.D. Martinez became the first Tigers player to connect three times against the Yankees since Charlie Maxwell in 1959.	"It's pretty cool just to say the first time you did it was here," J.D. Martinez said. "This is the pinnacle of baseball."	Stephen Drew had his third multihomer game this year for the Yankees, connecting in the seventh off Sanchez and ninth against Joakim Soria.	Tanaka gave up a career high-tying 10 hits and seven runs in five innings. He fell to 2-2 since his return from the disabled list on June 3.	"I was missing spots and I was missing them by a far margin so I wasn't really sharp today," Tanaka said through a translator.	After Tanaka got two quick outs to open the game, Cabrera singled and Victor Martinez sent a drive into the second deck in right field. Yoenis Cespedes reached on shortstop Didi Gregorius' ninth error of the season before J.D. Martinez went deep.	Victor Martinez had a two-run single in the second after Cabrera walked with two outs.	"It was nice to see him turn on some balls," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said of the switch-hitting Victor Martinez, who was batting left-handed.	Burawa and DePaula were optioned back to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre after the game.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: 3B Nick Castellanos was out of the starting lineup for a second straight day. He's batting .143 (9 for 63) over his last 19 games.	Yankees: CF Jacoby Ellsbury (knee) did some straight ahead running on the outfield grass and ran some short routes to make barehanded, over-the-shoulder catches of tossed baseballs.	SANTOS SURGERY	Yankees reliever Sergio Santos is going to have Tommy John surgery after making just two appearances for the team. Santos had 30 saves for the White Sox in 2011 but has been plagued by injuries since then. He was moved to the 60-day DL after the game.	UP NEXT	Tigers: Continue their seven-game road trip in Cleveland. LHP Kyle Ryan (1-1) gave up five hits over 6 1/3 innings in his first start in place of Shane Greene, who was recently demoted. But three of the hits were home runs.	Yankees: RHP Michael Pineda (8-3) took a no-hitter into the seventh inning in his last start. He faces the Phillies, the team that has scored the fewest runs in baseball this season, in the opener of an interleague series in New York.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

TORONTO -- In a game overflowing with offense, J.J. Hardy had to wait a little while to get involved.	When he did, he made his contributions count.	Hardy drove in the tying run with a single in the seventh inning, then hit a go-ahead single in a four-run ninth as the Baltimore Orioles recovered after blowing a seven-run lead to beat the Toronto Blue Jays 13-9 on Sunday.	"He was able to get two huge hits for us today," teammate Ryan Flaherty said.	Jimmy Paredes hit a three-run homer and Chris Davis added a solo shot as the Orioles used 16 hits to improve to 13-4 since June 4.	"The ball was flying," Hardy said. "Luckily we came out on top in the end."	Davis and pinch-hitter Nolan Reimold drew consecutive walks against Brett Cecil (1-4) with one out in the ninth before Hardy grounded an RBI single to center that eluded shortstop Jose Reyes, who thought second baseman Munenori Kawasaki was going to make the play.	"I got a little bit confused," Reyes said. "That's no excuse. That should be into the double play there and Cecil would be out of the inning."	Flaherty followed with a two-run triple and scored on a two-out single by Manny Machado.	Darren O'Day (4-0) got two outs to win for the second straight day.	The Blue Jays rallied from a 7-0 deficit to take a 9-7 lead on Jose Bautista's two-run homer in the fourth, but couldn't hold on. Toronto fell to 14-5 in June.	Paredes hit a three-run homer as the Orioles chased Scott Copeland with seven hits and seven runs in the second. Baltimore starter Chris Tillman, however, gave most of it back in the bottom half.	Ezequiel Carrera hit a three-run homer and Kevin Pillar also went deep as the Blue Jays went back-to-back for the fourth time. Tillman left after Reyes doubled and was replaced by Tommy Hunter. Josh Donaldson walked to load the bases before Bautista hit a two-run single, cutting it to 7-6.	Toronto tied it on Pillar's RBI single in the third, then went ahead on Bautista's homer off Brad Brach.	Davis cut it to 9-8 by connecting off Phil Coke in the fifth.	Baltimore tied it in the seventh when Travis Snider's hit to center skipped past Pillar and rolled to the wall for a triple. Steve Delabar replaced Aaron Loup and gave up an RBI single to Hardy.	"J.J.'s two-out hit kind of knocked a little wind back into us and maybe a little from them," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.	Both starters got just four outs in the shortest start of the season for each. Copeland allowed seven runs and eight hits, while Tillman gave up six runs and six hits.	Tillman is 0-3 with a 15.00 ERA in four starts against the Blue Jays this season.	The Blue Jays put the potential go-ahead run at second with one out in the eighth but O'Day, who escaped a bases-loaded jam Saturday, came on and struck out Donaldson, walked Bautista, then got Edwin Encarnacion to foul out.	FEATHER IN HIS CAP	Showalter earned his 1,295th win, tying Cap Anson for 32nd place.	FINE WITH NINE	Baltimore won a game in which it allowed nine runs for the first time since July 20, 2010, against Tampa Bay.	FRESH ARMS COMING	Following the game, the Blue Jays optioned Copeland, Coke and RHP Ryan Tepera to Triple-A Buffalo. They'll call up three players before Monday's game at Tampa Bay.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: CF Adam Jones, who started at DH on Friday and Saturday, was held out of the lineup. Jones sat out three games last week after injuring his right shoulder diving for a ball on Monday. ... RHP Miguel Gonzalez (right groin) allowed two runs and four hits over five innings in a rehab start for Double-A Bowie on Saturday. He's expected to start Thursday at Boston.	Blue Jays: RHP Aaron Sanchez (strained back muscle) will throw Monday for the first time since going on the disabled list last weekend, retroactive to June 6. Sanchez has missed his past three turns.	UP NEXT	Orioles: Baltimore is off Monday before opening a three-game series at Boston on Tuesday. RHP Ubaldo Jimenez (5-3, 3.27 ERA) starts against RHP Joe Kelly (2-4, 5.32). Jimenez has won his past two outings and has not lost since May 16 against the Angels, a span of six starts.	Blue Jays: RHP Drew Hutchison (6-1, 5.33) starts the opener of a three-game series at Tampa Bay on Monday. Hutchison has a 9.46 ERA in seven road starts. RHP Matt Andriese (2-1, 3.26) pitches for the Rays.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CLEVELAND --  Roberto Perez will never be known for blazing speed, but his legs helped the Cleveland Indians to their first walk-off win of the season.	The slow-footed backup catcher slid home with the winning run on David Murphy's sacrifice fly in the ninth inning, and the Indians defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 1-0 Sunday.	"It seemed like his legs got shorter as he was running," Cleveland manager Terry Francona joked. "That play was hold-your-breath time, for sure."	Rays starter Alex Colome retired his first 16 batters, but Cody Anderson kept the game scoreless in his major league debut for the Indians.	Murphy hit a 3-1 pitch from reliever Kevin Jepsen (1-5) to center field. Kevin Kiermaier made a strong throw home on one bounce, but catcher Curt Casali couldn't come up with the ball as Perez slid across the plate.	"I wasn't looking at the ball," Perez said. "I think it beat me, but then he dropped it so I was OK."	"Sometimes you don't even know if you have the ball or not," Casali said. "At that particular moment I thought I could have had it and tried to just make a good baseball play. Unfortunately I didn't get it today."	Perez led off the ninth with a single. Jason Kipnis singled to right, extending his hitting streak to 16 games, and Perez advanced to third.	Perez held at third on Francisco Lindor's line drive to left that was caught by Joey Butler. Michael Brantley was intentionally walked before Murphy delivered.	Cody Allen (1-2) pitched the ninth for the win.	While Colome dominated the Indians, Anderson held the Rays to six hits in 7 2/3 innings. Called up from Triple-A Columbus before the game, he struck out four and walked one in the longest outing of his professional career.	Anderson admitted he was very nervous when he took a big league mound for the first time.	"I really didn't have much control in the first inning," he said. "I couldn't feel my body or the ball."	Kiermaier doubled with one out in the eighth and went to third on a groundout. Francona pulled Anderson, who was given a standing ovation by the crowd of 20,847 as he walked to the dugout.	Marc Rzepczynski issued an intentional walk to Evan Longoria and struck out pinch-hitter Nick Franklin to end the inning.	Anderson, who began the season at Double-A Akron, was 4-3 with a 1.89 ERA in 13 minor league appearances.	Colome allowed one hit in seven innings. His bid for a perfect game was broken up by Michael Bourn's infield single with one out in the sixth.	Bourn hit a hard grounder behind first base. The ball skipped off the glove of Jake Elmore, who was playing a couple of steps off the bag, and rolled to his right. Second baseman Logan Forsythe picked it up, but his throw to Colome covering the bag was late.	Colome was coming off the shortest start of his career, lasting two innings and allowing six runs and seven hits in a 16-4 loss to Washington on Tuesday. He hasn't won in six starts since defeating Oakland on May 21.	WELCOME TO THE BIG LEAGUES	The Indians flew Anderson into town Saturday so he could have some time to adjust to his new surroundings.	"It was a special day," said Anderson, whose parents attended the game. "I'm honored to be here and help the team win. Any time you're in a big stadium for the first time the adrenaline takes over and you don't get as fatigued."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: Manager Kevin Cash doesn't know if RHP Erasmo Ramirez (strained groin) will make his next scheduled start. Ramirez left Saturday's game in the fourth inning.	Indians: C Yan Gomes, who has been bothered by a sore neck, had a scheduled day off.	UP NEXT	Rays: RHP Matt Andriese makes his fifth start of the season Monday night as Tampa Bay opens a three-game series at home against Toronto.	Indians: RHP Trevor Bauer, getting an extra day between starts, faces the Detroit Tigers on Monday night at Progressive Field.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CINCINNATI --  The Reds' hottest hitters were at it again, helping a sick starter pull through a tough day.	Todd Frazier and Jay Bruce each hit a two-run homer on Sunday, leading the Cincinnati Reds to a 5-2 victory and another successful series against the Miami Marlins.	The Reds took two of the three games, with the teams trading shutouts before the series finale. The Reds have won 11 of their last 15 games against the Marlins.	Rookie Michael Lorenzen (3-2) went seven innings and singled home a run while winning back-to-back starts for the first time in his career. He was sick on Saturday night, but matched his career high for innings.	His father, Clif, was in the stands, watching him play in the majors for the first time.	"I felt pretty bad all day," the right-hander said. "I woke up and my throat was really sore. It felt like it was closed up and I had these body aches. It was a battle out there today."	Lorenzen struggled in the first inning, when he gave up a pair of hits and a run. He was able to pull through on a muggy, 85-degree afternoon.	"After the first inning, Michael settled down and pitched a great game," Bruce said. "It was nice to get some separation there and finish the series off."	Frazier connected in the first inning against David Phelps (4-4) for his fifth homer in the last five games. Frazier has 23 homers, two behind Miami's Giancarlo Stanton for the major league lead. Fifteen of his homers have come at Great American Ball Park.	Bruce's 11th homer in the sixth inning snapped a 2-2 tie and extended his hitting streak to five games. He is 10 for 20 during the streak with a pair of homers.	Aroldis Chapman escaped a bases-loaded, none-out threat in the ninth, getting three strikeouts for his 15th save in 16 chances.	Dee Gordon opened the game with a single, stole second, advanced on Derek Dietrich's single and scored on Stanton's groundout, the outfielder's major league-leading 64th RBI. Justin Bour led off the second inning with his sixth homer, tying it at 2.	The Marlins had an aggressive play turn into an out at the plate in the fifth. Gordon singled, and Dietrich followed with a double off the base of the wall in center. Third base coach Lenny Harris sent Gordon, who slid headfirst into the plate but was tagged for the first out of the inning.	THREE FOR BYRD	Cincinnati's Marlon Byrd had three singles and grounded into a double play. In his first three games back from a broken right wrist, the left fielder was 4 for 11 with a solo homer.	CLOSE CALL	Chapman extended his streak of converting 52 consecutive save chances at Great American since September 2012.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: Gordon shook his head several times after he was tagged on the left side of the face by catcher Brayan Pena has he tried to score in the fifth. Gordon stayed in the game.	Reds: CF Billy Hamilton was hit on the top of his left foot by one of Phelps' pitches as he tried to bunt in the second inning. He was in pain as he headed to first base but stayed in the game.	UP NEXT	Marlins: After a day off, they open a 10-game homestand starting with St. Louis. Miami RHP Jose Urena (1-3) faces Carlos Martinez (7-3).	Reds: Following a day off, they open a series in Pittsburgh. Johnny Cueto (4-4) is 18-4 career against the Pirates, winning his last seven decisions against them since 2012. Jeff Locke (4-3) starts for Pittsburgh.	---	Follow Joe Kay on Twitter: http://twitter.com/apjoekay	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

WASHINGTON -- With the way the Washington Nationals are pitching these days, they hardly needed all of the runs Bryce Harper and his teammates provided from the start.	Harper and Yunel Escobar homered as the Nationals scored a team-record nine times in the first inning, plenty for Gio Gonzalez to cruise past the Pittsburgh Pirates 9-2 Sunday.	Gonzalez (5-4) threw seven shutout innings as the Nationals completed a three-game sweep.	"The last three guys that we've had start games have pitched really well," Nationals manager Matt Williams said. "That sets our tone."	Pittsburgh arrived at Nationals Park this weekend with an eight-game winning streak, but was stopped by the pitching-rich Nationals. Max Scherzer came within one strike of a perfect game while throwing a no-hitter Saturday, and rookie Joe Ross struck out 11 in the series opener.	Harper hit his 24th homer, extending his career high and connecting in his second straight game after sitting out Friday with a tender hamstring.	Charlie Morton (5-1) had won all five of his starts this season. But the Nationals erupted for the biggest first inning in their history, and Morton was charged with all nine runs on eight hits and a walk while getting just two outs.	"Toss it! Kick it to the curb!" Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said after the Pirates' lost weekend during which they scored just three runs.	Gonzalez gave up four hits, struck out four and walked two. This came after he allowed five runs and eight hits in just 3 1/3 innings at Tampa Bay in his previous start.	Gonzalez won a day after Scherzer's near-perfect performance.	"It's kind of tough to follow up on his act," Gonzalez said. "My response was just to try to bounce back from a terrible start. I was attacking the strike zone . everything just worked today."	Gonzalez passed the injured Stephen Strasburg for second on the Nationals' career victory list with 47. He also hit an RBI double.	After Morton retired the first batter, Escobar singled and Harper homered. The Nationals batted around, and Escobar's three-run homer finished Morton and brought Vance Worley from the bullpen.	Corey Hart hit a two-run homer in the Pittsburgh ninth off Felipe Rivero.	UP NEXT	Pirates: Open a three-game series with visiting Cincinnati on Tuesday.	Nationals: Start a three-game series with visiting Atlanta on Tuesday.	MOVES	The Nationals activated pitcher Tanner Roark from the paternity list and sent fellow right-hander Taylor Hill back to Triple-A Syracuse.	BOO WHO?	Pittsburgh's Jose Tabata was booed during each of his at-bats. He ended Scherzer's bid for a perfect game with two outs in the ninth inning when he was hit by a pitch -- many thought he lowered his left elbow a bit to get nicked.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

PHILADELPHIA --  The Phillies finally got a victory from a starting pitcher. And Adam Morgan might have been the most unlikely candidate to break their monthlong drought.	Winless in the minors this year, Morgan won his major league debut in surprising style, outpitching Michael Wacha and leading Philadelphia past the St. Louis Cardinals 9-2 Sunday.	"I'm just very, very happy for the opportunity. Very grateful," Morgan said. "I didn't want to try to do too much or overthink. The main thing was keeping the ball down."	Morgan (1-0) allowed one run and six hits in 5 2/3 innings, striking out six and walking two against the team with the best record in the majors.	The 25-year-old lefty had been 0-6 in 13 starts at Triple-A this season, and was 13-28 lifetime in the minors. He was called up before the game to pitch in place of Jerome Williams, who's out with a strained left hamstring.	Morgan snapped a club-record 25-game stretch without a win for a Phillies starter dating to May 23, a string that stretched from Memorial Day to Father's Day.	With his dad, mom and fiancee in the stands, Morgan said he was determined not to get overcome by the moment. He said he "looked down the whole game" until he was taken out.	"Morgan really stepped up with the opportunity," Phillies manager Ryne Sandberg said. "He showed a lot of composure out there and was terrific."	"He controlled the baseball, had good fastball command on both sides of the plate. He had a real good look as if he was under control right from the get-go. He was impressive and fun to watch."	Sandberg said Morgan earned another start.	Morgan got the first two batters in the sixth before a single by Jason Heyward and walk to Jon Jay. The crowd of 30,423 booed Sandberg when he pulled Morgan with a 5-1 lead, and reliever Luis Garcia retired Tony Cruz on a grounder to end the inning.	Wacha (9-3) gave up five runs and eight hits in five innings.	"They made me pay for my mistakes," Wacha said. "I just didn't have it today."	Wacha entered tied for the major league lead with six road wins, going 6-1 with 2.08 ERA in eight road starts.	"He's been real good for us," St. Louis manager Mike Matheny said. "It was just one of those days."	Andres Blanco homered while Ben Revere and Maikel Franco each got three hits for the Phillies in their highest-scoring game of the season.	"Guys played amazing defense and were swinging the bats great," Morgan said. "It was a great team win."	The Phillies won for just the second time in 13 games. Ranked at or near the bottom of the league in several offensive categories, they were outscored 22-5 in losing the first two games of the series.	"We had offense up and down the lineup," Sandberg said.	Heyward and Jhonny Peralta homered for the Cardinals, who lost for the first time in their last six games against Philadelphia.	"We missed a couple of opportunities early," Matheny said. "It's tough to keep scoring after a couple of big-run games. It's going to slow down a little."	The Phillies scored three times in the second on Cody Asche's RBI double and Cesar Hernandez's two-run single.	After Peralta upped his team-leading homer total to 11 with a solo shot leading off the fourth, the Phillies scored twice in the fifth on an RBI double by Franco and a single by Ryan Howard.	Blanco had a three-run, pinch-hit homer in the seventh.	HOT HEYWARD	Heyward homered off Jonathan Papelbon leading off the ninth. He is batting .550 (11-for-20) in his last five games.	"I don't know what else we could ask for the way he's hitting the ball," Matheny said.	PINCH-HIT PRO	Blanco went deep for the second time as a pinch-hitter this season and leads the majors with seven pinch-hit extra-base hits.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: LHP Cole Hamels threw a bullpen session without a problem. He remains on schedule to start Wednesday's game against the Yankees. The Philadelphia ace missed his last start on Friday due to a strained hamstring.	UP NEXT	Cardinals: St. Louis is off on Monday and will resume play at Miami on Tuesday night when Cardinals RHP Carlos Martinez (7-3, 2.80) opposes Jose Urena (1-3, 4.18).	Phillies: RHP Kevin Correia (0-1, 1.69) start Monday night at Yankee Stadium against Michael Pineda (8-3, 3.54). Correia, who will be making his third start for the Phillies, is winless with a 1.35 ERA in two career outings against the Yankees.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO --  Along with many of the White Sox hitters, Gordon Beckham hasn't been pleased with his lack of offensive production.	He hopes that will change after his first career game-winning home run.	Beckham led off the bottom of the 11th inning with a homer and Melky Cabrera went 5 for 5 and the Chicago White Sox beat the Texas Rangers 3-2 on Sunday.	Ryan Rua and Leonys Martin homered for the Rangers, who dropped two of three to the White Sox.	The White Sox have won two straight after losing a season-high eight straight games.	Beckham homered on the first pitch in the 11th inning from Rangers reliever Alex Claudio (1-1).	"I feel I haven't been doing that much lately. So that was a big pick-me-up for me and a great win," said Beckham, who came in as a defensive replacement late in the game.	The White Sox have not scored more than five runs in the past 17 games. Chicago is also 29th in runs and 28th in batting average.	"We know we have to start kicking it into gear," Beckham said. "I think everybody realizes that. You're starting to see the offense come around a little bit. I feel like we're having a lot better at-bats."	The Rangers had opportunities to take the lead in the 10th and 11th innings.	Pinch-hitter Rougned Odor singled to center with one out in the 10th inning. During Prince Fielder's at-bat, Odor went from first to third on White Sox reliever Zach Putnam's wild pitch.	After Fielder walked, Putnam got out of the inning by getting Mitch Moreland to hit into double play.	The Rangers had the bases loaded in the 11th with one out for Hanser Alberto. White Sox reliever Jake Petricka (2-2) got Alberto to hit a bouncer to Beckham at third, who threw home to catcher Tyler Flowers who threw out Alberto at first to complete the double play and end the inning.	"You keep giving a ballclub an opportunity to stick around and don't cash in on those opportunities, it can come back to hit you," Rangers manager Jeff Banister said. "We had multiple opportunities to push runs across and didn't."	All five games on the White Sox homestand were decided by one run.	"Winning those tight games is huge," Petricka said. "We've always been on the wrong side for the last week and half or so now it's going to go our way."	With runners on first and second in the sixth inning and the White Sox trailing 1-0, Alexei Ramirez blooped a one-out RBI single to right off Rangers reliever Ross Detwiler to score Jose Abreu from second and advance Cabrera to third.	Conor Gillaspie followed with a sacrifice fly to score Cabrera and gave the White Sox a 2-1 lead.	Detwiler, who was demoted to the bullpen after coming off the disabled list earlier in the month, allowed two runs and three hits in two-thirds of an inning.	Martin tied the game with a solo shot on a 1-2 pitch from White Sox starter Jose Quintana in the seventh inning. It was Martin's fifth of the season, snapping an 0-for-21 streak.	Quintana allowed two runs and five hits in seven innings. He struck out five and walked two.	Rangers starter Yovani Gallardo pitched five scoreless innings. He allowed five hits and struck out three with one walk on 98 pitches.	"It seemed like I had to work out of trouble quite a bit and make pitches," Gallardo said. "It's not like I went out and had easy innings. ... The command wasn't there to be honest. "	In the first inning, Rua hit Quintana's 2-1 pitch deep into the left-field seats for his first home run of the season. Rua was activated from the 60-day disabled list on Friday. The 25-year old was out with a fractured heel.	The White Sox failed to score in the third, despite having a runner at third with one out. Gillaspie was unable to score from third on Carlos Sanchez's bloop single to left. Adam Eaton flied out to shallow left and Avisail Garcia struck out.	Cabrera robbed Shin-Soo Choo of a hit in the seventh inning with a diving catch.	UP NEXT	Rangers: Texas is off on Monday and travels home to face Oakland on Tuesday. RHP Chi Chi Gonzalez is scheduled to make his fifth major league start.	White Sox: LHP John Danks is scheduled to start Monday at Minnesota. In 27 starts against Minnesota, he is 7-14 with a 5.67 ERA.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: Third baseman Adrian Beltre said Sunday his injured right thumb is "progressing little by little," but that it's still painful for him to swing a bat and he doesn't know when he'll be playing again. Beltre said he took swings over the weekend and was "searching for a grip that won't hurt. I'm still working on it." Rangers manager Jeff Banister said he didn't know exactly when Beltre would return to the lineup. "When Adrian says that he's ready to play then he'll be back in playing," Banister said, though he added he didn't think Beltre would be still be sidelined by the All Star break.	STANLEY CUP	Less than a week after winning the Stanley Cup, Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville, forward Andrew Shaw, and defenseman Michal Rozsival paid a visit to U.S. Cellular Field with the Stanley Cup. Quenneville, Shaw and Rozsival along with members of the White Sox and some of their children posed for a group picture with the Cup before the game.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- David Ortiz passed two Hall of Famers on the career home run chart. He was hardly the only Boston hitter who had a big day.	Ortiz launched his 476th homer -- which traveled 456 feet, according to ESPN Stats & Information -- to move past Stan Musial and Willie Stargell, and the Red Sox banged out 13 extra-base hits Sunday in a 13-2 victory over the Kansas City Royals.	Hanley Ramirez hit his team-best 15th homer and Mookie Betts also went deep for the Red Sox, who set a season high for runs. Xander Bogaerts had three doubles, and Wade Miley (7-6) pitched six scoreless innings.	Ortiz homered leading off the fourth to move into 29th place on the career list.	"I got to meet 'The Man' [Musial] one time a long time ago," Ortiz said. "I didn't get to see him playing, but he was very impressive in his career. When they start mentioning your name next to those all-time Hall of Famers, that's something that means you're doing something right. It's an honor."	Betts, Brock Holt and Dustin Pedroia, the first three batters in the lineup, each had three of Boston's 16 hits. They combined to go 9-for-15 with seven runs and six RBI.	"That's a good way to finish the road trip," Boston manager John Farrell said. "Evidenced by the scoreboard, there were a number of really good at-bats, particularly the top three guys setting the tone for us."	Betts, who missed the cycle by a single, is batting (.556) with nine extra-base hits in a nine-game hitting streak.	Bogaerts stroked a three-run double in a five-run fifth when the Red Sox batted around and chased Chris Young (6-3).	Boston's first nine hits were all for extra bases. The Red Sox had a season-high eight doubles.	Miley, who pitched out of a bases-loaded jam in the first, was the beneficiary of the offensive outburst. He limited the Royals to five singles, walked three and struck out two.	"The offense got some runs early and often and kept scoring the whole game," Miley said. "It makes it a lot easier to just go out there and try to throw strikes."	Young, who had tossed 13⅓ scoreless innings in winning his previous two starts, yielded seven runs on three homers, four doubles and three walks in 4⅔ innings.	"I didn't make enough good pitches," he said. "That's what happens when you face a good team and you're not at your best."	Lorenzo Cain's two-run triple with two outs in the ninth prevented the Royals from being shut out.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: 3B Pablo Sandoval (sprained left ankle) and C Blake Swihart (sprained left foot) were unavailable after getting hurt Saturday. They are day-to-day. ... C Ryan Hanigan (broken right hand) begins a rehab assignment Monday with Triple-A Pawtucket. He went on the disabled list May 2. ... RHP Justin Masterson (right shoulder tendinitis) threw a side session and will not pitch Monday for Pawtucket on a rehab assignment. He could be activated Tuesday.	Royals: LHP Jason Vargas (strained flexor) is playing catch but not throwing off a mound.	EXTRA, EXTRA	The last time the Red Sox had 13 or more extra-base hits in a game was June 4, 2013, against Texas. It was the fifth time since 1914 they've had at least 13 extra-base hits in a game.	KRATZ CLAIMED	The Red Sox picked up veteran C Erik Kratz off waivers. He was designated for assignment by the Royals on June 11. The 35-year-old Kratz has also played for the Pirates, Phillies and Blue Jays.	UP NEXT	Red Sox: RHP Joe Kelly, who starts Tuesday night at Fenway Park, is 1-1 with a 3.32 ERA in three career starts against Baltimore.	Royals: 1B Eric Hosmer is 4-for-9 against Mariners ace Felix Hernandez, who starts Monday night when the Royals open a three-city, 10-day trip in Seattle.	Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MINNEAPOLIS -- After botching an easy comebacker to the mound in the third inning, Jake Arrieta made certain he never lost control of the game.	Arrieta pitched a four-hitter and Dexter Fowler hit a grand slam, leading the Chicago Cubs over the Minnesota Twins 8-0 on Sunday.	Arrieta (6-6) walked a career-high six in his last start, but didn't walk anyone and struck out seven for his second career shutout and first since last Sept. 16 against Cincinnati.	"Stuff was crisp, actually got better as the game wore on," Arrieta said. "Got comfortable and found a really good tempo."	Arrieta was anything but comfortable after flubbing an easy chopper by Byron Buxton for an error in the third inning. Buxton eventually made it all the way to third base, but Arrieta escaped the inning without any damage.	Arrieta then set down 16 of the next 17 hitters he faced, and was extra careful not to make another mistake on three other comebackers later in the game.	"He was upset with himself, very upset with himself," Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. "It was definitely on his mind."	Minnesota has lost 10 of its last 15 and has been blanked three times in June.	Fowler's second career slam capped a six-run eighth inning. The shot brought the several thousand Cubs fans at sold-out Target Field to their feet for a prolonged standing ovation and "Let's go Cubs!" chant.	Kyle Gibson (4-6) took the loss.	"As a team, we need to get back on track and that's what we're looking to do against the White Sox," Gibson said.	Anthony Rizzo hit a solo home run in the fifth. Starlin Castro added three hits and an RBI and rookie slugger Kyle Schwarber drove in two runs.	Before the game, Maddon said the plan was still to send Schwarber back to Triple-A Iowa.	Last year's No. 4 overall pick was called up to give the Cubs an extra hitter during this past week's stretch of interleague games.	Schwarber went 8 for 22 with six RBI and dropped in a two-run single to left-center during the big eighth inning.	After Joe Mauer doubled off the left-field wall in the first, Arrieta set down 21 of the next 23 batters. The right-hander struck out the side in the fifth and has won three of his last four decisions.	Despite finishing with 122 pitches, Maddon didn't come close to taking out Arrieta.	"If he had been through a bunch of high-stress moments it would've been a different story, but he was not," Maddon said.	HAPPY TO HELP	Schwarber knew all along he'd be going back to the minors after this week, regardless of how well he performed. He was just happy for the opportunity.	"Now it's time to go down and start working on all the stuff I need to work on and hopefully get back up here," he said.	The Cubs have yet to announce a corresponding roster move.	ROOKIES STRUGGLE	This series featured two of baseball's most highly touted prospects in Cubs 3B Kris Bryant and Buxton. Both young players struggled all weekend, combining to go 1 for 22 with seven strikeouts.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Twins: An MRI on CF Aaron Hicks' injured right forearm was "favorable." GM Terry Ryan hopes Hicks won't need more than 15 days on the DL.	UP NEXT	Cubs: Tsuyoshi Wada (1-1, 3.68) faces Clayton Kershaw (5-4, 3.29) to start a four-game series at home with the Los Angeles Dodgers on Monday. Wada tossed seven scoreless innings in his last start.	Twins: Coming off a win over St. Louis where he allowed one run in seven innings, Tommy Milone (3-1, 3.67) faces the Chicago White Sox and John Danks (3-7, 5.16) on Monday night.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  Athletics closer Tyler Clippard nearly paid a hefty price after lobbying manager Bob Melvin to work the ninth inning for a second straight day.	Having given up a two-run home run to slugger Albert Pujols in the eighth that trimmed Oakland's lead to one run, Clippard convinced the skipper to extend his workload then held his breath when Johnny Giavotella hit a deep fly out to the fence in left field with the tying run on base.	"I thought it was gone," Clippard said after recording his 12th save in the A's 3-2 win over the Los Angeles Angels on Sunday. "I wasn't happy with the execution, for sure. The left field fence veers out just enough and it stayed short, thank goodness."	Clippard was only scheduled to pitch the eighth after getting the final four outs of Saturday's 4-1 win.	Melvin changed his mind when Clippard came off the mound following Pujols' home run and asked to go back out for the ninth.	"I didn't come here to lay up, you know what I mean?" Clippard said. "If I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it. It's not something I'm going to be able to do a lot but if I can do that, especially in these kind of games ... and we need wins right now ... I'm happy to do it."	Scott Kazmir (4-4) gave up one run in 7 1/3 innings before Clippard took over.	The A's won the final two games of the series between the two teams after losing five of six to their division rivals.	"We had a pretty spirited series overall, the way they won the first one and then how we won the second one and then today," Melvin said. "Three really hard-fought games."	A's third baseman Brett Lawrie, who made a catch while falling into the Oakland bullpen on Friday night, turned in another nifty defensive play when he stumbled over the mound in foul territory to catch Carlos Perez's pop fly.	Sam Fuld doubled with one out in the A's third and scored on Billy Burns' single. Burns extended his hitting streak to 12 games, matching his career high.	Lawrie and Ike Davis added RBI singles in the sixth to put the A's up 3-0.	Pujols hit his AL-leading 21st homer of the season, and tied Tim Salmon's team record with 13 home runs in June.	David Freese followed with a bloop single, but Clippard went on to finish for the save.	"I thought we had pretty good at-bats," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "We just couldn't get a hit with guys in scoring position."	Garrett Richards (7-5) gave up three runs in six innings.	REVIEWED FULLY	The game was delayed by more than five minutes due to a lengthy replay review when Lawrie was thrown out attempting to steal third base with one out in the second. Lawrie was initially ruled safe by umpire Greg Gibson, who then quickly changed the call to out after Lawrie appeared to overslide the bag.	Melvin challenged the call but it was upheld after a review of 5:14 minutes when replay officials determined Angels third baseman David Freese tagged Lawrie on his right shoulder before sliding past the bag -- overturning the umpire's original call but confirming the out.	"I actually wanted to see if I could get my challenge back because I wasn't challenging the original call, I was challenging the slide off the base and not being tagged," Melvin said. "I think what they're saying is that no matter what the challenge is, it's the whole play."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: Pitcher Jered Weaver was placed on the 15-day disabled list and will undergo an MRI on his left hip Monday. He has lost his last four starts. ... OF Alfredo Marte was called up from Triple-A Salt Lake City to take Weaver's roster spot.	UP NEXT	Angels: LHP Hector Santiago (4-4), who pitches Monday in Anaheim against the Houston Astros, is winless in his previous three starts.	Athletics: RHP Jesse Chavez (3-6) starts Monday in Texas. He struck out a career-high 11 in his most recent start against San Diego.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SEATTLE --  Thanks to some late offense and a strong performance by the bullpen, the Houston Astros headed off to Southern California with momentum for the final leg of their road trip.	Colby Rasmus and George Springer each homered to break open a one-run game, and the Astros avoided a sweep with a 6-2 win over the Seattle Mariners on Sunday.	"Definitely a big, big win for us," Rasmus said. "With the way the game was going early on, pitchers and hitters, we were just battling. A lot of good things going on, but not a lot of runs. That's baseball. We needed it today. Big time."	Despite a 1-0 lead in the top of the first, things looked bleak early on for Houston. Rookie starter Vincent Velasquez struggled with his command, walking three batters in the first inning. Seattle tied the game, but Velasquez was able to prevent further damage by striking out Brad Miller with the bases loaded.	Velasquez ran into more problems in the fourth, but Tony Sipp came on in relief and retired two straight to strand runners at the corners.	Velasquez allowed only two hits in 3 1/3 innings. But he walked four and gave up a run, and was pulled after throwing 93 pitches.	"That's about as many pitches as you can throw in the shortest amount of time," Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. "I will say, getting out of that first inning with one run, regardless of how he sort of got through it, was a real key in this game. Really kept us in the game, where they could've really opened it up."	Five relievers followed Velasquez, combining to allow two hits in 5 2/3 innings. Will Harris (4-0) went 1 1/3 scoreless innings for the victory.	The bullpen was given a bit of breathing room in the seventh when Rasmus hit a two-run homer. Springer added a solo shot in the ninth, his 12th homer of the season.	Springer led off the game with a single, moved up on a wild pitch and scored on a single by Evan Gattis.	With the score 1-all, Rasmus doubled leading off the second. He scored on Luis Valbuena's single.	J.A. Happ (3-4) allowed three runs -- two earned -- in five innings.	"I thought J.A. pitched behind the count early in the ballgame," Seattle manager Lloyd McClendon said. "As the game went on, he started to find his groove and really, if you think about it, he pitched well enough to win."	Logan Morrison scored twice for the Mariners. Nelson Cruz singled him home in the first and Robinson Cano had a sacrifice fly in the fifth.	SPRINGER SPARKING OFFENSE	Springer extended his career-high hitting streak to 14 games, and his ability to contribute offensively in a multitude of ways from the leadoff spot has impressed.	"He's certainly setting the tempo for us very early for us in games," Hinch said. "He's a real threat. He can steal bases, he can do a lot. Having him be our energy, be at the top of the order during this stretch has been a big key. He jump-starts us in a lot of different ways."	HAPP'S RECORD ENDS	Happ had allowed two runs or fewer in his first six home starts, which tied a club record.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: Hinch said 2B Jose Altuve still was not ready to start due to a sore right hamstring.	Mariners: Hisashi Iwakuma (strained lat) said his body felt good, one day after he threw 56 pitches in 2 2/3 innings during his first rehab start at Class A Everett. McClendon said Iwakuma will need at least two more rehab starts before being reinstated from the disabled list.	UP NEXT	Astros: Brett Oberholtzer starts Monday night at the Los Angeles Angels.	Mariners: Seattle continues its eight-game homestand when ace Felix Hernandez faces the AL Central-leading Royals.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DENVER --  The Colorado Rockies' offense is beginning to catch up to Troy Tulowitzki's hot bat.	Charlie Blackmon drove in four runs, Tulowitzki had three RBI and the Rockies beat the skidding Milwaukee Brewers 10-4 on Sunday.	Nick Hundley had four hits and Nolan Arenado led off Colorado's three-run fourth inning with his 17th homer as the Rockies broke loose for their most runs since scoring 11 against St. Louis on June 8. They averaged 3.2 runs in their previous 12 games before Sunday.	Colorado has its first two-game winning streak in two weeks, but Tulowitzki is not to blame. The All-Star shortstop had two hits Sunday and has reached base in 21 straight games.	He isn't celebrating, though, despite hitting .394 since May 29.	"I feel OK. I need to be better," Tulowitzki said after hitting safely for the 18th time in 19 games. "I need to be a better player. I haven't been playing the way I want myself to play, let's put it that way."	All 10 runs came off Matt Garza, who allowed 13 hits for the second straight start.	It wasn't entirely good news for the Rockies. Star outfielder Carlos Gonzalez left in the fifth with a mild sprain of his left hand. He was injured when he flied out in the third.	Gonzalez played the field in the fourth and banged into the right-field wall trying to make a leaping catch of Ryan Braun's leadoff triple. Braun scored on a groundout to pull Milwaukee to 3-2.	X-rays were negative and Gonzalez was wearing a heavy wrap on his left hand.	"I took a couple of dry swings and it was sore so they decided to take me out of the game and do treatment," Gonzalez said. "No bone problems. Hopefully it's nothing bad."	Braun also doubled for the Brewers, who have lost eight of nine.	"Wasn't good today," manager Craig Counsell said. "Just regroup and get back at it on Tuesday."	Rockies starter Chris Rusin (3-2) stopped his two-game skid. He allowed three runs and seven hits in six innings to win for the first time since June 6.	Tulowitzki and Blackmon did much of the damage offensively.	Blackmon hit a two-run single in the fourth and an RBI single in the sixth. Tulowitzki drove in two runs in the sixth when the Rockies scored four times to take a 10-3 lead.	"It's nice to score some runs. Our main thing is winning a series, especially at home," Tulowitzki said. "We haven't been doing that of late. A lot of things we did good today we haven't been doing well."	Blackmon and Tulowitzki each had an RBI in the third when Colorado went ahead 3-1. Garza was hurt by an error on second baseman Hernan Perez that led to three unearned runs in the inning.	Garza (4-9) allowed seven earned runs in 5 1/3 innings, raising his ERA to 5.48.	"It hasn't been my year," Garza said. "Everything has been just falling the right way. You can only keep working. It is frustrating."	REFRESHED	Hundley looked sharp after getting the day off Saturday. The catcher tied his career highs for hits and runs (three). Hundley, who came into the season batting .238 in his major league career, raised his average to .302.	"This is as consistent as I've been in my career," Hundley said. "I've always been able to get hot, and when I get cold I get real cold."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: OF Carlos Gomez was going to run the bases and take fly balls before the game to test his ailing right hip. Counsell said if everything went well Gomez could play Tuesday against the Mets. He has missed six of the last seven games.	Rockies: Relief pitcher Rafael Betancourt (vertigo symptoms) was scheduled to pitch in a rehab assignment. If the right-hander has no setbacks he could be activated for Tuesday's game against Arizona. Betancourt is eligible to come off the 15-day disabled list Monday, an off day.	UP NEXT	Brewers: RHP Mike Fiers (3-7, 4.50 ERA) opens a three-game series against the Mets on Tuesday night. Fiers is 0-1 with a 6.00 ERA in two career games -- one start -- against New York.	Rockies: RHP Kyle Kendrick (2-9, 5.95) gets the start to open Colorado's three-game series against Arizona. Kendrick is winless in six starts at Coors Field this season.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

PHOENIX --  San Diego handed Arizona one big inning, and the Diamondbacks gratefully took full advantage.	A.J. Pollock and Paul Goldschmidt each singled home a pair in that seven-run second and the Diamondbacks won 7-2 Sunday to take two of three from the Padres in the weekend series.	Jeremy Hellickson (5-4) pitched six innings for the Diamondbacks, allowing two runs and six hits. He struck out a season-high seven with no walks before leaving the game with a sore back.	"His breaking ball was superb today," manager Chip Hale said. "He was bouncing it, then he used his changeup a lot and located the fastball. So it was a really good job."	Hale said Hellickson would have stayed in the game but felt some pain in his back while swinging at bat in the sixth. Hellickson said he didn't think the injury was serious and expected to make his next start.	"I'm not very concerned at all," he said. "I've just never really tweaked anything in that area and just kind of want to be cautious with it."	Two San Diego errors, two walks and a hit batter contributed to Arizona's big inning. Only three of the seven runs off Andrew Cashner (2-9) were earned.	"That few moments of losing the focus, throwing to the wrong base, not gripping the ball or throwing accurately and missing the ball in the infield, that little lack of focus can pile on," Padres interim manager Pat Murphy said. "You put all those together, it is a seven-run inning and you feel pretty (bad about) what could have been."	San Diego fell to 2-5 since manager Bud Black was fired.	Cashner allowed four hits in four innings. He struck out five, walked two and hit Hellickson with a pitch with the bases loaded.	"I thought I made pitches throughout the whole inning," Cashner said. "It was just that a couple of balls found holes and you can't walk guys in that inning. ... If a couple of different plays are made I think it is a different inning for sure."	Andrew Chafin threw three scoreless innings to earn his first career save.	The Diamondbacks had just one baserunner after their second-inning outburst. The Padres retired the last 17 batters but couldn't overcome their mistakes in the second.	Cashner struck out Yasmany Tomas to start the inning, then Arizona loaded the bases on two walks and Chris Owings' single. Nick Ahmed grounded sharply to third, but Will Middlebrooks' throw home pulled catcher Derek Norris off the plate and the runner was safe. The Padres challenged the call but it was upheld on review.	That brought up Hellickson, who couldn't get out of the way of a 3-2 pitch that hit him in the left hip, bringing in another run.	Pollock's single to left scored two more. San Diego's defensive woes continued when David Peralta's grounder scooted through the legs of shortstop Clint Barmes for an error. Hellickson scored on the play and it was 5-0.	With first base open, the Padres chose to pitch to Goldschmidt, the major league leader entering the game with a .358 batting average. With the infield in, Goldschmidt's soft single up the middle brought in two more to make it 7-0 and gave the Arizona first baseman 57 RBI.	The Diamondbacks have won seven of 10 and are within a game of .500 for the 10th time since they were 8-8 on April 24. They have lost in all nine of their attempts to reach .500 since then.	"I think we're going to get there and we're going to go past it," Hale said, "but we have to be better. We have to be a better team to get there."	FACING WEST	Arizona is three games into a 16-game stretch against NL West foes. The Diamondbacks have three at Colorado, three at San Diego, three at home against the Dodgers, followed by four in a row in Arizona against the Rockies.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: RHP Archie Bradley, on the 15-day DL with right shoulder tendinitis, said he will start rehab work with Triple-A Reno next week.	UP NEXT	Padres: San Diego has Monday off, then opens a three-game series Tuesday at San Francisco. RHP Odrisamer Despaigne (3-5, 4.92 ERA) faces Giants LHP Madison Bumgarner (7-4, 3.09).	Diamondbacks: After an off day Monday, Arizona plays three at Colorado. RHP Chase Anderson (3-1, 2.84 ERA) takes the mound against RHP Kyle Kendrick (2-9, 5.95).	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ATLANTA --  Julio Teheran gave up only one hit in seven scoreless innings, Pedro Ciriaco's pinch-hit single in the seventh scored the only run and the Atlanta Braves shut out the New York Mets 1-0 on Sunday to complete a three-game sweep.	The Mets have lost five straight and scored no more than one run in four of the losses.	Matt Harvey (7-5) matched Teheran through six scoreless innings before giving up Ryan Lavarnway's two-out double and Ciriaco's run-scoring single up the middle.	Teheran (5-3) improved to 4-0 at Turner Field. He allowed two walks -- both to Curtis Granderson -- with five strikeouts.	Right-hander Jim Johnson pitched out of a ninth-inning jam for his fourth save. Closer Jason Grilli was unavailable after earning saves in the first two games of the series.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles Dodgers hammered Tim Lincecum early and Yusmeiro Petit often on the way to one of their best offensive displays of the season.	Yasmani Grandal homered twice, Adrian Gonzalez and Justin Turner also went deep, and the Dodgers knocked Lincecum out of the game in the second inning en route to a 10-2 victory over the San Francisco Giants on Sunday night. It was the earliest exit ever for two-time Cy Young Award winner in 260 regular-season starts in the big leagues.	"I don't think there's really a game plan with Lincecum. I mean, he's been doing it for a long time," Grandal said. "This was just one of those days where he had a bad day, and we just happened to go off on him."	All four homers came against Petit during a span of 15 batters after the right-hander relieved Lincecum and raised the Dodgers' NL-leading total to 91. In Petit's 19 previous appearances this season, he had allowed five home runs in 38 innings.	"He doesn't throw it that hard to get it by you, and today he was just leaving balls up," Grandal said. "He made some mistakes and we capitalized on them. I've faced Petit a lot in the past couple of years, and he's pretty good. He has that kind of invincible ball that he throws on the bottom of the zone, and you think it's a ball, but it just keeps getting called a strike."	Lincecum (7-4) retired only four of the 12 batters he faced, including Brett Anderson on a sacrifice bunt. The four-time All-Star right-hander surrendered five runs on seven hits and was done after 53 pitches.	"My fastball location wasn't there," Lincecum said. "They battled me through some at-bats, and I wasn't finishing them off with my secondary pitches. I'm not finishing hitters off the way I used to, and I'm giving them more chances than need be. I was leaving curveballs up in the zone and getting behind in counts.	"I just wasn't doing a good job of executing my pitches out there," he added. "I was actually doing a really poor job. Just about every hit I gave up, the ball was up in the zone. I could have pitched a lot better than I did, but I'll try my best not to let it linger at all."	Matt Cain and Jake Peavy are working their way back from injuries, which will leave manager Bruce Bochy with a difficult decision -- who might have to go to the bullpen? That was where Lincecum ended up last season when he was struggling.	"You just go about your business, and whoever makes the decision for that to happen, it's up to them," Lincecum said. "You can't control that, so you've just got to worry about what you can control -- and that's what you do when you get out there."	Grandal made it 6-1 in the third, leading off with a drive into the right-field pavilion. Gonzalez and Grandal hit solo shots in the fourth, and Turner made it 10-1 in the fifth with a two-run drive to center field. Grandal increased his home run total to 10 with his fourth career multihomer game and second this season.	Anderson (3-4) yielded a run and five hits in six innings after going 0-3 with a 3.38 ERA over his previous seven starts. The Dodgers' third victory in 12 meetings with the Giants this season kept them in first place in the NL West by 1½ games over the defending World Series champions.	The Dodgers took the lead in the first when Turner drew a two-out walk, advanced to third on a single by Gonzalez and scored on Lincecum's wild pitch to Howie Kendrick.	"It looked like Timmy was going to have an easy first inning with a couple of quick outs," Bochy said. "But that two-out walk made it turn into a stressful inning, and it might have played a part in the second one."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Giants: LF and leadoff hitter Nori Aoki did not play because of a bruise near his right ankle, which occurred on Saturday when he was hit by a pitch leading off the game.	UP NEXT	Giants: LHP Madison Bumgarner (7-4) pitched eight innings in each of his past two starts but was on the short end of 1-0 and 2-0 losses to Arizona's Chase Anderson and Seattle's Felix Hernandez. Last year's World Series MVP goes into Tuesday night's opener of a three-game set against San Diego trying to avoid losing three straight starts for the first time since June 27 and July 3-8, 2014.	Dodgers: LHP Clayton Kershaw (5-4) gets the start Monday night against the Chicago Cubs in the opener of a 10-game trip. The reigning NL MVP and three-time Cy Young Award winner has given up 34 earned runs in 93 innings -- just five fewer than he allowed in 198⅓ innings all of last season, when he led the majors in ERA for the fourth straight year with a career-best 1.77 mark. Kershaw already has matched last year's total of home runs allowed with nine.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK -- Phillies manager Ryne Sandberg might have as much confidence in Maikel Franco as the young rookie third baseman has in himself.	Sandberg gave Franco the greenlight on a 3-0 count in the sixth inning Monday, and the 22 year old slugger didn't disappoint. He sent the pitch a long way into the bleachers in left field at Yankee Stadium for his second home run of the night.	Franco had career highs of four hits and five RBI and made a fabulous diving play to help Philadelphia snap a 12-game road skid with an 11-8 victory over the New York Yankees.	"I think he's the right guy for the spot there. The way he's swinging the bat and makes something happen," Sandberg said. "He's been our most consistent and productive hitter on a daily basis with driving the ball and stinging it."	Since being recalled from the minors on May 15, Franco leads the Phillies with nine home runs and 24 RBI. His teammates have taken notice of the talent.	"He's got everything you look for in a young player," starter Kevin Corriea said. "There's similarities to (Albert) Pujols."	Franco was not alone in the hit parade for baseball's lowest scoring team. Ben Revere and Freddy Galvis each had three hits, and Cesar Hernandez and Ryan Howard drove in two runs apiece as the Phillies had a season high for runs and hits (18) in a second straight offensive outburst against a top starter.	They chased Michael Pineda (8-4) in the fourth inning in this game and beat Michael Wacha and St. Louis 9-2 Sunday.	Winners of 11 of 13 at Yankee Stadium coming in, New York was roughed up for 10 or more runs in consecutive home games for the second time this year. Texas did it May 22-23 against Pineda and CC Sabathia, Tuesday's starter.	Brett Gardner hit a three-run homer off Corriea and had four hits -- two on bunts. He reached base five times for New York, which had 14 hits and was 4 for 13 with runners in scoring position.	Jake Diekman (2-1) walked three in two scoreless innings for the win in relief of Corriea. In his third start this year, Corriea allowed five runs in four innings.	Franco opened the scoring with a homer in the first. He singled and scored in the third, had two-run single in the fourth and connected for a long two-run drive to left in the sixth off Chris Capuano. He struck out with the bases loaded to end the seventh with a chance to push his first multihomer game to three longballs.	"I just play the game, play baseball," said Franco, when asked if he was nervous playing at Yankee Stadium. "When I go out there I just try to play the game right."	In the bottom half, Franco dived to snare Chris Young's sharp grounder leading off and made a strong throw to first for the out.	Trailing 2-1 going the third, the team that scored just 22 runs in those 12 straight road losses -- their longest road losing streak since 1999 -- put their first four batters on with Howard hitting a two-run single to put the Phillies back on top.	In 3 1/3 innings, Pineda allowed career highs of eight runs and 11 hits -- his second poor start sandwiching an outing in which he took a no-hitter into the seventh.	"His slider wasn't very good. His fastball was spotty," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "He struggled tonight."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: Cole Hamels is still on target to start Wednesday in the series finale. Sandberg said "everything went well" for the LHP in his last bullpen session.	Yankees: Mark Teixeira was out of the starting lineup because of a stiff neck -- a problem for about 10 days. Girardi said postgame an MRI was "pretty good," and the 1B was given an injection to "speed up the healing process."	UP NEXT	Phillies: Sean O'Sullivan (1-5) is coming off his best start of the year: one run and four hits in five innings against Baltimore with a season-high seven strikeouts. He is 2-2 with a 5.87 ERA against New York.	Yankees: Sabathia has held opponents to batting average of .083 (2 for 24) with runners in scoring position. Philadelphia entered Monday 28th of 30 teams with a .220 average (122 for 555) with RISP.	MILESTONE NEGOTIATIONS	The Yankees said that executives Randy Levine and Lonn Trost met with Zack Hample, the fan who caught the home run ball hit by Alex Rodriguez for hit No. 3,000 Friday night and thus far has refused to give it to A-Rod. Team spokesman Jason Zillo said the sides have made significant progress in negotiating a return of the memento and will meet again next week.

CLEVELAND --  If there's one ballpark Detroit doesn't mind visiting it is Progressive Field.	It's become a home away from home for the Tigers.	Yoenis Cespedes drove in three runs, Miguel Cabrera reached base four times and the Tigers continued to push Cleveland around, beating the Indians 8-5 on Monday night.	Cespedes hit an RBI double off Trevor Bauer (6-4) in the first inning, homered in the third and added a sacrifice fly in Detroit's four-run fourth as the Tigers improved to 8-2 against the Indians this season -- 4-0 in Cleveland -- and 34-14 since the start of 2013.	Detroit has won 15 of the last 18 against Cleveland and improved to 19-5 in the Indians' downtown home the past three seasons. The Tigers are 10-1 in their past 11 games on the corner of Carnegie and Ontario.	"We know we're not going to go 162-0, but mentally, maybe, we feel more comfortable in this park," Tigers designated hitter Victor Martinez said. "I don't know, honestly, why everyone seems to like to hit here. I guess it's just one of those things in baseball that you can't really explain."	Cabrera walked twice, once with the bases loaded, singled twice and remained a mystery to Cleveland pitchers. He's batting .649 (24 of 37) with five homers and 16 RBI against the Indians this year.	Martinez followed the fourth-inning walk to Cabrera with a two-run single to make it 6-3.	Blaine Hardy (3-1) replaced starter Kyle Ryan in the fourth and pitched 2 1/3 hitless innings.	Detroit manager Brad Ausmus was reluctant to discuss his team's dominance against the Indians.	"I really can't answer that," he said. "I wasn't here for (one) of those seasons, so I'm not sure why it's been that way. We just seem to play well against them."	Jason Kipnis had two RBI, and David Murphy and Roberto Perez homered for the Indians.	The Tigers snapped a 3-all tie by scoring four in the fourth to chase Bauer, who matched a career worst by allowing seven runs and nine hits in three-plus innings. The quirky right-hander was coming off a strong outing against the Cubs, but struggled with an unrelenting lineup that has few holes.	Detroit loaded the bases on two singles and a walk, bringing up the dangerous Cabrera.	"He spooks me," said Indians manager Terry Francona, who joked before the game that he has even wiggled his fingers at the slugger, trying to hex him at the plate. "I've tried everything."	Bauer pitched around Cabrera, walking him to force in the go-ahead run. Martinez followed with his single to put the Tigers ahead by three. Bauer, who managed to avoid major trouble in the first two innings, was pulled and Cespedes hit a sacrifice fly off Jeff Manship.	Bauer wasn't happy with his outing, but thought the Tigers were fortunate to get a few of their hits.	"At some point, balls that are bloops are going to fall and they all just seemed to fall tonight," he said. "I think of the nine hits off me, two were hit hard."	After scoring three total runs in their three previous games, the inconsistent Indians scored three in the third to tie it at 3 on Kipnis' two-run double and Michael Brantley's RBI single.	Kipnis extended his hitting streak to a career-high 17 games. He has hit safely in 26 straight at home.	Cespedes put the Tigers up 3-0 with his 10th homer, a leadoff line drive that barely cleared the wall in right-center.	MOVING ON UP	Cabrera has taken a 1.3 million-vote lead over Kansas City's Eric Hosmer in All-Star balloting at first base. Cabrera's vote total of 9,342,149 is second overall in the AL to Royals C Salvador Perez's 10,199,151. "I even voted once for Miggy yesterday," Ausmus cracked. "If he finishes one vote ahead of Hosmer, you guys better remember that."	CENTRAL CASTING	The Tigers are 23-12 against the AL Central.	THREE FOR ALL	Tigers 3B Andrew Romine went 1 for 4 with a run and RBI in his third straight start for Nick Castellanos, who is batting .215 over his last 35 games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: C Alex Avila (left knee), on the disabled list since May 8, is traveling with the team. Ausmus said Avila could begin a rehabilitation assignment with Triple-A Toledo on Thursday.	UP NEXT	Tigers: LHP David Price tossed a seven-hitter in a 4-0 victory over the Indians on June 12. The four-time AL All-Star is 8-1 with a 2.11 ERA in 11 career starts against Cleveland, striking out 74 in 72 2/3 innings.	Indians: RHP Danny Salazar tries to remain unbeaten this season at Progressive Field, where he is 3-0 with a 3.26 ERA in five starts. He took a no-decision in his previous outing against the Cubs last Thursday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Toronto Blue Jays manager John Gibbons got his 500th major league win Monday night, and easily explained the big number.	"That shows I've been around a long time," Gibbons said.	Tampa Bay shortstop Asdrudal Cabrera didn't stick around so long in Toronto's 8-5 victory. He got ejected and some of his equipment got tossed, too.	Cabrera was thrown out by plate umpire Kerwin Danley for arguing a called third strike in the fifth.	Heading back to the dugout, Cabrera threw his helmet and bat toward the mound. Umpire crew chief Joe West picked them up and gave them to a stadium security official located in the umpire locker room walkway.	"Bad conduct ... Doesn't deserve a comment," West told a pool reporter.	Cabrera left the locker room before it was opened to reporters postgame.	"Maybe he wants him to sign it? I'm not sure," Rays manager Kevin Cash said of West. "I have no idea. First I've ever seen."	Jose Bautista hit his 15th homer, a go-ahead drive during a four-run sixth inning. Jose Reyes and Dioner Navarro also homered for Toronto, 2-6 against Tampa Bay this season.	A section of stadium lights went out in the top of the fourth, but the decision was made to keep playing after a three-minute delay. Those lights came back on an inning later.	Bautista's leadoff shot against Matt Andriese (2-2) broke a 3-all tie. Reliever Ronald Belisario gave up the other three runs in the inning that included an RBI double by Chris Colabello.	Drew Hutchison (7-1) allowed three runs and nine hits over five taxing innings. He struck out six, walked two and hit a batter during a 109-pitch outing.	"Probably did a good job of grinding and giving our offense a chance," Hutchison said. "As they've been all year, they were huge."	Down 8-5, the Rays loaded the bases with one out in the eighth. Roberto Osuna struck out Steven Souza Jr. and Nick Franklin and pitched the ninth for his first save.	"Can't say enough about Osuna," Gibbons said.	Osuna struck out five in two hitless innings.	Andriese gave up four runs and five hits in 5 1/3 innings as Tampa Bay lost for the third time in 11 games. The Rays had given up a combined six runs on a just completed 4-1 road trip.	Logan Forsythe hit a solo shot in a two-run seventh that got the Rays within 7-5.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: 2B Devon Travis (shoulder) could return this week. ... 3B Josh Donaldson was rested.	Rays: RHP Jake Odorizzi (oblique) threw off a mound and could make a rehab start next week. ... 1B James Loney (broken left middle finger) is set to take dry swings late this week. ... LHP Matt Moore (elbow surgery) appears on target to return late this month or early July.	NEW START	OF Grady Sizemore was hitless in two at-bats during his first game Monday night with Class A Charlotte. After being released by Philadelphia, he signed a minor league contract with Tampa Bay on June 15. ... INF Tim Beckham (strained right hamstring) went 1 for 2 during his first appearance as the DH.	NUMBERS GAME II	Hutchison has a 5.33 ERA, but is getting a major league-best 8.27 runs per game of support. ... Blue Jays 1B Edwin Encarnacion went 0 for 4 and has four hits in his last 52 at-bats against Tampa Bay. ... Rays RHP Steve Geltz pitched a perfect ninth and set a team record by retiring 28 consecutive batters.	MOVING DAY	The Rays optioned LHP Enny Romero to Triple-A Durham after the game. The corresponding move was not announced.	UP NEXT	Toronto knuckleballer R.A. Dickey (3-6), activated Monday from bereavement list, will face Rays RHP Chris Archer (8-4) Tuesday night. Archer allowed four hits and struck out 18 over 14 scoreless innings in two previous starts this season against Toronto.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

MINNEAPOLIS --  With ballyhooed rookie Byron Buxton at the top of their lineup, the Minnesota Twins have been unbeatable.	Well, at least for his first time batting first, when the offense couldn't have been much better.	Kennys Vargas went 4 for 4 with a three-run homer and four RBI, Buxton had three hits as the leadoff man Monday night and the Twins trounced the Chicago White Sox 13-2.	"It's got to feel good for him," said manager Paul Molitor, who didn't commit to keeping Buxton in the top spot.	Joe Mauer homered to start a five-run fourth against John Danks (3-8), and Eduardo Nunez punctuated that inning with a two-out, two-run shot. The rally was fueled by a throwing error on shortstop Alexei Ramirez, whose attempt to start a double play sailed into right field.	Brian Dozier added a two-run homer in the eighth for the Twins, who are 8-3 against the White Sox this season while outscoring them 70-28.	"Just to have an outbreak like that, that was pretty cool," said Torii Hunter, who drove in Buxton with a two-run double during a five-run sixth inning after the lanky, 21-year-old speedster beat out a routine grounder to Ramirez for a hit.	Buxton moved up from ninth to first in the order in his ninth major league game and doubled in his first at-bat with a headfirst slide into second base.	"If he can keep that going and have good at-bats like he did today? No doubt, he's not going anywhere," Hunter said.	Buxton scored three runs.	"It means a lot. I'm just glad Mollie had that much faith in me to put me in the leadoff spot. I just went out there and relaxed and had fun," Buxton said.	Buxton also gave starter Tommy Milone (4-1) a lift by ending the third inning with a strong throw home from center field. The ball sailed a bit high but went straight to catcher Kurt Suzuki's mitt to keep Melky Cabrera from scoring on a single. The White Sox had taken a 2-1 lead on Adam LaRoche's two-run single.	"That's huge. Obviously we know what he's capable of. All tools, all aspects of what he does are good," said Milone, who hasn't lost in four starts this month, allowing a total of seven earned runs.	Danks fell to 0-4 in June with a 6.85 ERA.	"I stunk. There's really no other way to put it," said Danks, who dropped to 3-9 with a 6.82 ERA in 16 career starts against the Twins.	The White Sox started their nine-game trip in a rough way, falling to 2-11 on the road against AL Central foes.	"You tip the cap to them, and you move on," manager Robin Ventura said. "They just outplayed us."	The White Sox have been outscored 58-19 in the first inning this year, both totals the worst in the majors. This was their ninth straight game with three runs or fewer, their longest such streak since 10 in a row in 1976.	The Twins were in a scoring slide, too, with 55 runs in their first 20 games this month. This will help their average.	"It's amazing what a couple hits can do in terms of how you feel at the plate," Molitor said.	DARRYL HAMILTON'S DEATH	Ventura and Molitor were both teammates of outfielder Darryl Hamilton, who was murdered Sunday in suburban Houston, according to authorities. The 50-year-old Hamilton played with Molitor for the Milwaukee Brewers from 1988-92 and with Ventura for the New York Mets from 1999-2001.	Molitor described the shock of hearing the news and said Hamilton's death was "the overriding thing" on his mind Monday.	Said Ventura: "I'm still sick to my stomach. He's a great person. I loved Darryl Hamilton."	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox: The injury-thinned bullpen is close to being back to full strength. LHP Dan Jennings, on the DL for the last two weeks because of inflammation in his neck, was sent on a rehab assignment to Triple-A Charlotte. RHP Matt Albers, who broke the pinkie on his pitching hand during the April 23 fight with the Kansas City Royals, will throw a simulated game Tuesday.	Twins: Hunter was hit in the chest by Cabrera's throw from left field as he retreated to third base on a shallow fly, but he was all right.	UP NEXT	Jeff Samardzija (4-4, 4.67 ERA) will start for the White Sox on Tuesday, his third appearance against the Twins this season. Mike Pelfrey (5-3, 2.97) takes the mound for Minnesota, also for the third time this year against the White Sox.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO -- So much for that little slump for Kris Bryant. One big swing against Clayton Kershaw's vaunted curveball was enough to get the rookie back on track.	Bryant connected twice for his first career multihomer game, and the Chicago Cubs beat Kershaw and the Los Angeles Dodgers 4-2 on Monday night.	"He's been struggling a bit lately, KB has," manager Joe Maddon said, "and I just love the fact that he continues to battle."	Bryant had just one hit in his previous 18 at-bats before he drove a 1-2 curveball from Kershaw over the wall in right for a two-run homer in the third. His two-out drive on an elevated fastball from Adam Liberatore in the eighth was his 10th of the season and led to a curtain call for the slugger.	"It's a game of peaks and valleys, and I was in a valley," Bryant said. "I just went into the game telling myself I'm due, I'm due for a big game, and I got it."	Matt Szczur also had a solo shot against Kershaw as Chicago (38-30) moved eight games over .500 for the first time since it was 82-74 in 2009, according to STATS. It was the first homer of the season for Szczur, who was promoted from Triple-A Iowa before the game for his fourth major league stint of the year.	"It was a good game all around," Bryant said.	The two homers off Kershaw (5-5) ran his total for the year to 11, two more than the left-hander allowed all of last season. The reigning National League MVP and three-time Cy Young Award winner struck out nine in seven innings, ending a string of three consecutive starts with double-digit strikeouts.	"A couple pitches here or there. Just wish they were doubles instead of homers, but it happens sometimes," Kershaw said. "You could say you can live with the solo homers, but a two-run homer with two outs and two strikes is tough there."	The Cubs got solid work from five relievers after Tsuyoshi Wada departed in the third due to cramping in the back of his left arm. Center fielder Dexter Fowler was replaced in the fifth after he sprained his left ankle.	Travis Wood (4-3) pitched 3⅓ innings for the win. Jason Motte allowed Joc Pederson's 19th homer in the ninth before finishing for his second save on his 33rd birthday.	Los Angeles (39-32) finished with five hits in the opener of a 10-game road trip. The NL West leaders have dropped three of four.	Wada gave up a leadoff homer to Enrique Hernandez and a single by A.J. Ellis before he was replaced by Wood with no outs in the third. The team said Wada had cramping in his left deltoid muscle and would be evaluated again Tuesday.	WHEN THE LIGHTS WENT OUT	The Cubs played the game under protest after the lights at Wrigley Field flickered in the bottom of the sixth inning, prompting an odd scene when Maddon repeatedly came out of the dugout to talk to the umpires during a 10-minute delay.	"Just be a little more patient and wait for the lights. That was my argument," Maddon said. "That's it. Nothing more complicated than that. I just thought it was inappropriate."	With one out and Kershaw pitching to Bryant, a handful of lights in several banks went out at the ballpark. Maddon had multiple discussions with the umpires before play resumed, and all the lights appeared to be back on shortly after the game started again.	"We felt that we would be able to continue playing, that it was sufficient lighting," crew chief Jerry Meals said. "Out of the six banks, none were out. There was scattered lights out."	Dodgers manager Don Mattingly was frustrated with the length of the delay with Kershaw on the mound.	"I'm not quite sure what Joe's arguing," Mattingly said. "But at that point, once they make that decision, that's when you'd like to get on with it from the standpoint of letting a guy stand out there for 10 minutes."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: RHP Joel Peralta (shoulder soreness) was activated from the 15-day disabled list before the game. He pitched 5⅔ scoreless innings over seven April appearances, going 1-0 with three saves in three chances.	Cubs: RHP Neil Ramirez (shoulder inflammation) and INF Mike Olt (broken right wrist) will take their injury rehab stints to Triple-A Iowa on Tuesday. ... LHP Zac Rosscup (shoulder inflammation) plans to throw Tuesday and get re-evaluated. "As of now, I think I'm headed to Arizona Wednesday to kind of get things cranking again," he said. ... Maddon said OF Jorge Soler (left ankle sprain) is at least a week away from beginning a rehab stint.	UP NEXT	Dodgers RHP Zack Greinke (5-2, 1.81 ERA) tries for his first win since May 5 when he takes on RHP Jason Hammel (5-2, 2.89 ERA) on Tuesday night. Greinke is 0-2 in his past eight starts despite a 1.99 ERA in the winless stretch. Hammel is 2-0 with a 2.66 ERA in four June starts.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  None of the Los Angeles Angels' hitters spends more time in the indoor cage before regular batting practice than Albert Pujols. And it's been paying off for the slugging first baseman, who is finally enjoying a healthy season.	Pujols homered twice and Erick Aybar scored the go-ahead run on a safety squeeze in the eighth inning by Daniel Robertson, leading the Angels to a 4-3 victory over the Houston Astros on Monday night.	The Angels (36-35) moved within 4 1/2 games of first-place Houston in the AL West. Texas is three games behind the Astros, who have dropped three of four after winning five straight.	"Those are the guys we're chasing, so this is a big series. And to be able to win the first game is huge," Pujols said. "I thought it was going to get away from us, but we just never gave up. Erick had a big at-bat and got on base, and we were able to execute on the bunt."	Aybar began the winning rally with a leadoff single against Chad Qualls (1-4) and advanced on a wild pitch. One out later, Joe Thatcher walked pinch-hitter Matt Joyce while Aybar stole third.	In came Will Harris, and Robertson bunted up the first base line. Chris Carter charged the ball and made an errant, backhand flip past catcher Jason Castro as Aybar crossed the plate. Robertson was credited with his second RBI in seven games since his recall from Triple-A.	"It's a hard play to defend," said Pujols, who has won two Gold Gloves at first base. "You can't break too soon from the bag because the guy from first could steal, and it's a safety squeeze. Obviously, it worked out perfect for us."	Huston Street (3-2) struck out Evan Gattis to end the eighth and then pitched a perfect ninth.	Angels left-hander Hector Santiago allowed two hits over six innings, including rookie Domingo Santana's leadoff homer in the third, before handing a 3-1 lead to the bullpen.	Houston tied it in the eighth against Joe Smith on an RBI single by Castro and a run-scoring double by Jose Altuve.	Altuve, the All-Star second baseman and batting champion, was 1 for 3 after missing the previous four games because of a right hamstring strain. In the third inning, he sent a towering fly to the short fence in the right-field corner, where Kole Calhoun reached over and easily took a home run away from him.	"The thing I worry about most with a guy coming back after a layoff is strike-zone judgment. But he battled, and it was good to see," Houston manager A.J. Hinch said. "I mean, he looked a little antsy early on, trying to swing at a lot of pitcher's pitches. But with the game on the line, I trust him as much as anybody to put a good at-bat together."	Astros lefty Brett Oberholtzer allowed two runs, four hits and four walks in his sixth start of a season that has been detoured twice by blisters on his index finger.	Pujols gave the Angels a 2-1 lead in the fifth, driving a 1-2 pitch into the rock pile just to the right of the center-field trees after a two-out walk to Mike Trout. It was the first homer allowed this season by Oberholtzer in 28 innings to that point.	"I thought Obie battled," Hinch said. "He did a good job of escaping some danger after four free passes and a hit by pitch."	Pujols hit another two-out homer in the seventh off righty Josh Fields, raising his season total to 23 and his career mark to 543 -- five behind Mike Schmidt for 15th place.	"I don't think about that. I'm locked in every day," Pujols said. "Obviously, you want to have success every time you go to the plate, but it's impossible. So the best thing you can do is get yourself ready for the game and prepare yourself. Sometimes you're going to ride it for a while, and sometimes you get away from it for a while. Now I just feel good."	The three-time NL MVP has 15 homers in his last 24 games. His 50th career multihomer game raised his career total against Houston to 48, breaking a tie with Hank Aaron for the most by any player against Astros pitching.	"I've been putting good swings on the ball all season," Pujols said. "Even the outs that I was making, earlier in the year, I was hitting the ball hard. But I wasn't able to get any good results. And as a veteran guy, I know that it's a long season, and sooner or later you'll be able to figure it out."	After striking out the side in the first inning on 16 pitches, Oberholtzer escaped a bases-loaded jam in the second.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: An MRI on RHP Jered Weaver's left hip did not reveal any structural damage or tears, a day after he was put on the 15-day disabled list. "He won't pick up a ball for five days, and then we'll just try to see where he is and move forward from there," manager Mike Scioscia said. "I have a lot of confidence that we're going to see him get better, but right now there's no doubt about just trying to exhale a little bit and get him back where he needs to be."	UP NEXT	Astros: RHP Collin McHugh (7-3) is 14-3 with a 3.62 ERA over his last 24 starts after losing each of his previous six.	Angels: LHP C.J. Wilson (5-5) has allowed one run over 15 innings with 17 strikeouts in his last two starts -- a 1-0 home win against Oakland and a 7-1 decision at Arizona.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

SEATTLE -- Joe Blanton retired from baseball last season after he was unable to make it in the minor leagues. Now, he's shining for the first-place Kansas City Royals.	Blanton pitched six-plus innings of two-hit ball to lead Kansas City to a 4-1 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Monday night.	"Being able to get back was kind of almost the pinnacle and now I'm just riding it out and enjoying it," said Blanton, who struck out seven. "Probably more than I enjoyed it before because I definitely appreciate it more and know how hard it is and what it takes."	Blanton (2-0) lowered his ERA this season to 1.73 after allowing one run. The 34-year-old, who stepped away from the game after being released by the Oakland Athletics in 2014 following two subpar outings with Triple-A Sacramento, was recalled to the big leagues on May 16.	The right-hander made seven appearances out of the bullpen before making his first start in the majors since 2013 on June 17. He has allowed only one run in both of his starts and has yet to allow a walk after issuing none to Seattle on Monday.	"I don't ever not sense him finding a rhythm," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "We brought him in (relief) one game to get an inning in and it was like a 32-pitch inning, but every other time out there, he's been able to execute almost flawlessly, his pitches."	The Mariners took a 1-0 lead in the first inning on a home run by Robinson Cano. Blanton retired the next 16 batters before Austin Jackson doubled to lead off the seventh.	Kelvin Herrera replaced Blanton and promptly moved Jackson to third with a wild pitch, but retired the next three batters to escape the jam.	Herrera, Wade Davis and Greg Holland all pitched one inning of hitless relief. Holland earned his 14th save in 15 opportunities.	Felix Hernandez (10-4) took the loss after allowing four runs, nine hits and a walk in 6 2/3 innings. He struck out five.	"I thought he had good stuff," Mariners manager Lloyd McClendon said. "You look at their numbers, they don't walk, they don't strike out. They just pester you."	Alex Rios tied the game at 1 with a run-scoring single in the second. Rios advanced to second on the throw to the plate and Omar Infante followed with a double off the wall in right to score Rios.	Mike Moustakas doubled in the third to drive in Alcides Escobar and give the Royals a 3-1 lead.	Escobar, who had a three-hit night, drove in Jarrod Dyson with a single in the seventh. Dyson singled and stole second with two outs to get into scoring position.	UP NEXT	Mariners: Rookie LHP Mike Montgomery takes the mound against the Royals, the team that drafted him 36th overall in the 2008 draft.	Royals: RHP Jeremy Guthrie attempts to solve a Mariners team that has proved to be trouble for the veteran in his career. He is 2-7 with a 5.40 ERA lifetime against Seattle.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: LHP James Paxton still is not cleared to begin throwing, McClendon said. Paxton is dealing with a strained tendon in the middle finger of his throwing hand.	Royals: Danny Duffy is still scheduled to come off the DL on Wednesday and start the series finale at Seattle. Duffy, who has been recovering from an inflamed left shoulder, takes Yordano Ventura's spot in the rotation. Ventura went on the DL with irritation in the ulnar nerve of his right elbow.	CRUZ INJURED	Seattle right fielder Nelson Cruz left the game in the seventh inning after popping his pelvic bone out of place. The Mariners initially called the injury a tight right hamstring.	"They got it popped back in and he is OK now, we'll see how he feels tomorrow," said McClendon, who didn't think it would be a long-term injury.	MARINERS OFFENSE TAMED	The Mariners had two hits in a game for the fourth time this season, and third time in less than two weeks. Seattle struck out 13 times, the 10th time they have whiffed at least that many times.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

NEW YORK --  Maikel Franco's parents and brother were in the ballpark for his latest big game at Yankee Stadium. By now, everyone in baseball must be taking notice of Philadelphia's rookie bopper.	Franco homered again and had five RBI for the second straight night in the Bronx, snapping a ninth-inning tie with a two-run double Tuesday that sent the Phillies to an 11-6 victory over the New York Yankees.	"I'm just in a great moment right now," Franco said after becoming the first Phillies hitter to knock in five runs in consecutive games since RBI became an official statistic in 1920.	Franco lofted a three-run shot to the short porch in right field and Cameron Rupp hit his first major league homer for the Phillies, who handed lights-out reliever Dellin Betances his first career loss in 110 appearances.	Philadelphia, which began the night with the worst record and fewest runs in the majors, has scored 31 while winning three in a row for the first time since a six-game streak May 13-18.	Garrett Jones, Brett Gardner, Chase Headley and Alex Rodriguez homered for New York, which had won 11 of 12 at home before giving up 34 runs in losing its last three.	It's the third time the Yankees have allowed at least 11 runs in three straight games -- the previous occasion was in 2000. They have never done so in four consecutive games, according to STATS.	"It's not enjoyable to watch and it's not enjoyable to be a part of," manager Joe Girardi said.	Pitching for the first time in six days, Betances (4-1) entered in the eighth with a runner on second and struck out consecutive batters to keep it tied.	Ben Revere opened the ninth with a double, and Cesar Hernandez was hit by a pitch while squaring to bunt. With the runners going, Franco hit a one-hop smash over the glove of Headley as he moved in to cover third.	Betances plunked another hitter before Andres Blanco lined a bases-loaded triple off Nick Rumbelow, who was making his big league debut.	It was the first time Betances allowed multiple runs in an outing since April 29, 2014. He was charged with four in one inning after bringing a 0.26 ERA into the game.	"I like to get in there as much as I can, but there's no excuses," Betances said. "They got the best of me today."	Franco went 4 for 5 with two homers and five RBI on Monday night in his first game at Yankee Stadium. The 22-year-old slugger, hit by a pitch in the seventh Tuesday, has 10 home runs since May 17 and is 6 for 8 with five runs and a walk in the first two games of this series.	"Using the whole field," Phillies manager Ryne Sandberg said. "Right now he's a pretty good force right in the middle of the lineup."	Hernandez had three hits -- including an RBI double. Ken Giles (3-1) fanned three in a scoreless eighth in a game that took 3 hours, 45 minutes, following a rain delay of 1 hour, 21 minutes, at the start.	The teams had a 13-hour respite before the series finale Wednesday afternoon.	Headley and Rodriguez hit consecutive homers off starter Sean O'Sullivan to begin the fifth. Headley's 100th career long ball ended a drought of 105 at-bats since May 25.	Carlos Beltran chased O'Sullivan with a one-out double and scored the tying run on Chris Young's two-out double off Elvis Araujo.	Yankees starter CC Sabathia squandered a 3-1 lead in the fourth, when the Phillies put up five runs on a pair of homers for their highest-scoring inning this season.	It was the eighth time in his 12 losses and no-decisions this year that Sabathia coughed up a lead, STATS said.	"We need him to do his job," Girardi said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: After the game, slumping 2B Chase Utley was placed on the 15-day disabled list with inflammation in his right ankle.	Yankees: 1B Mark Teixeira missed his second consecutive game because of a stiff neck, but hopes to play Wednesday. Teixeira was given an injection Monday. "If he comes in tomorrow and he's not better, you probably start to worry a little bit," Girardi said. ... New York closer Andrew Miller (left forearm) plans to play catch Wednesday.	UP NEXT	Phillies: Cole Hamels (5-5, 2.96 ERA) tries to pitch Philadelphia to a three-game sweep. He missed his previous turn Friday with a strained right hamstring. "He's supposed to be fine. He had a real good bullpen session. He feels good," Sandberg said. "And the little extra days off, he should be really fired up and ready to go."	Yankees: Ivan Nova returns to the mound nearly 14 months after Tommy John surgery. The right-hander is 40-22 with a 4.20 ERA in his career.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

WASHINGTON -- Stephen Strasburg's return from the disabled list was delayed more than two hours by an intense thunderstorm.	Strasburg was pretty intense himself.	The right-hander pitched five shutout innings in his return from the disabled list, Anthony Rendon tied his career high with four hits and the Washington Nationals defeated the Atlanta Braves 3-1 on Tuesday night.	"Obviously I've been working really hard to get things going in the right direction," said Strasburg, who went in with a 6.55 ERA.	Strasburg (4-5), who missed 21 games with neck tightness, was resilient in his return. He allowed baserunners in four of five innings but left with his first scoreless start this season.	"He was aggressive," manager Matt Williams said. "It helps when you feel good. He used his fastball a lot."	Strasburg used his time on the disabled list to work on his mechanics and to seek advice from teammates.	"Talking to a lot of guys in the clubhouse while I was away really kind of shed some light, what my strengths, what my weaknesses are," he said, "and I really just tried to pitch to my strengths."	Strasburg allowed four hits and a walk while striking out six. He was lifted after throwing 94 pitches in a game that was delayed 2 hours, 12 minutes at the start.	"Five strong innings for us," Williams said. "Tonight he had some (pitch count) limitations. The next time out he won't have any."	Strasburg went in 4-7 with a 4.24 ERA against the Braves and hadn't beaten them at home since 2012.	"We battled a lot, tried to get his pitch count up, maybe try to do something against the bullpen, but their bullpen came in and did pretty well," Atlanta's Chris Johnson said.	Washington's David Carpenter came on to retire Juan Uribe with two men on in the eighth.	Drew Storen pitched a scoreless ninth -- despite loading the bases -- for his 21st save.	Wilson Ramos added three hits for the Nationals, who have won four straight while allowing a total of four runs.	Cameron Maybin homered in the eighth inning, and Nick Markakis had three hits for Atlanta.	Alex Wood (4-5) allowed three runs and 10 hits over seven innings.	Atlanta struggled to score without first baseman Freddie Freeman, a career .340 hitter against Washington. Freeman, who has been out since Thursday, went on the disabled list Tuesday with a bruised right wrist.	The Nationals got to Wood for runs in three of the first four innings.	Denard Span doubled leading off the first and scored on a single by Rendon.	Rendon went in hitting .230 and had gone 2-for-16 over his previous four games.	In the third, Michael Taylor singled and took second when Maybin misplayed the ball in center field. Taylor stole third and came home on Span's one-out single past a drawn-in infield.	In the fourth, Taylor's hit scored in Danny Espinosa.	"He didn't let them put a crooked number up," manager Fredi Gonzalez said of Wood's effort.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Braves: An MRI on Monday did not reveal a more serious injury for Freeman. "Just a contusion," Gonzalez said. "Hopefully, we get him back sooner than later."	Nationals: Williams said 1B Ryan Zimmerman (left foot plantar fasciitis) took some swings for the first time since going on the DL.	UP NEXT	Atlanta RHP Shelby Miller (5-3, 1.99) takes a 0.73 ERA over four career starts against the Nationals into Wednesday's game. He will face LHP Jordan Zimmermann (5-5, 3.75), who has lost three straight starts.	NATIONALS MOURN PASSING OF KIMBERLY KNORR	The Nationals are mourning the death of Kimberly Knorr, wife of bench coach Randy Knorr. "The Washington Nationals are shocked and saddened to learn of the passing of Kimberly Knorr, the wife of Nationals bench coach Randy Knorr," Nationals GM Mike Rizzo said in a statement released after the game. "Randy and Kimberly have been beloved members of our Nationals family dating back to his days as a player for the Montreal Expos. Kimberly was an exceptionally warm, loving person who devoted much of her time to helping others. We are heartbroken by her loss."	HISTORY NOT REPEATED	Uribe's at-bat against Carpenter was a rematch from the 2013 National League Division Series, when Uribe's two-run homer for the Dodgers off then-Braves reliever Carpenter clinched the series in Game 4. This time, Carpenter got Uribe to fly out.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PITTSBURGH --  Andrew McCutchen couldn't help himself. After watching teammate Francisco Cervelli hit a three-run homer that tied the game and chased Cincinnati rookie starter Josh Smith on Tuesday, the Pittsburgh Pirates star center fielder did a spot-on impression of the ever ebullient catcher in the dugout.	Not that Cervelli minded.	"They're all a bunch of clowns here," Cervelli said. "They're always making fun of me, but I don't care because I'm another clown."	Minutes later McCutchen offered a slightly more serious trot around the bases, blasting a two-run shot off Pedro Villarreal to cap a fourth-inning outburst as the Pirates ended a three-game losing streak with a 7-6 victory.	Smarting from an ugly sweep in Washington over the weekend that included getting no-hit by Max Scherzer, the Pirates took out their frustrations on the Reds with a brief but impressive display. Pittsburgh's seven-run sprint through the fourth was one more run than they managed in their previous four games combined.	"You lose like we did against the Nationals, you're pretty amped up," McCutchen said. "Somewhat of a slow start, but that's why you play the whole game."	Rob Scahill (2-3) earned the win in relief of ineffective starter Jeff Locke. Mark Melancon worked a perfect ninth to pick up his major league-leading 24th save.	Jay Bruce homered and drove in three runs for the Reds. Cincinnati left 12 men on base and went just 4 for 17 with runners in scoring position.	"Usually six (runs) will do it," Reds manager Bryan Price said. "We're in a spot there where we're bringing in a new kid and Josh struggled a bit with his command, that'll certainly get better the more experience he gets because he's a strike-thrower."	The 27-year-old Smith went an eventful three-plus innings a few hours after being called up from Triple-A Louisville to fill in for Johnny Cueto, who is skipping a start to give his aching elbow a break. Smith worked around five walks in the first three innings before unraveling in the fourth. Pedro Alvarez smacked an RBI double off the wall to get the Pirates going and Cervelli followed with a shot to the Cincinnati bullpen in center to tie the game.	Smith left but Pittsburgh's outburst continued. McCutchen's ninth home run of the season off Villarreal (0-2) capped the Pirates' biggest inning of the year, as a four-run deficit turned into a 7-4 lead.	"We just kept reminding us we didn't need to be in a hurry," Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said. "We wanted to have the best at-bat we could, one pitch at a time. See the pitches you really need to see."	It also helped erase a shaky start by Locke, who gave up four runs in four innings. Some spotty defense behind him didn't help, though it could have been worse.	The Reds left seven runners on with Locke on the mound. Scahill wasn't much better but Pittsburgh's bullpen managed to slog the rest of the way, retiring the final six batters on strikeouts to win their seventh straight home game.	MARVELOUS MARTE	Pittsburgh leftfielder Starling Marte made a pair of spectacular diving grabs, stretching out to take a hit away from Billy Hamilton in the fifth and again to end seventh when he plucked Todd Frazier's liner off the ground that kept Hamilton from trotting home with the tying run.	"I had my hands up in the air like `game saver,' a game changer right there," McCutchen said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: Price said Cueto -- who is 18-4 with a 2.13 ERA against the Pirates -- could have pitched but the team felt its ace would benefit from a few extra days off to give right elbow a little more time to rest. "He's not feeling like he has his maximum amount of strength, so we're just trying to build that up right now," Price said. "It just makes sense for us right now." Cueto's next scheduled start is Friday against the New York Mets.	Pirates: Top pitching prospect Jameson Taillon is out indefinitely with what general manager Neal Huntington described as lower abdominal discomfort. Taillon, the team's top pick in the 2010 first-year player draft, is recovering from Tommy John surgery in his right elbow. He was scheduled to start in the Gulf Coast League on Tuesday.	UP NEXT	The series continues on Wednesday when Cincinnati's Mike Leake (4-4, 4.01 ERA) faces Pittsburgh's Gerrit Cole (11-2, 1.78 ERA). Cole leads the majors in victories and has won each of his last six starts but is 0-2 with a 4.70 ERA in four career starts against the Reds, including a 3-0 loss to Leake on May 6.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

BOSTON --  The Baltimore Orioles are missing some power with Adam Jones sidelined. David Lough is providing surprising pop in his place.	Starting in center field for the sixth time in seven games while Jones rests an injured right shoulder, Lough hit a three-run homer in a four-run second inning and the Orioles beat the Boston Red Sox 6-4 on Tuesday night, their 12th win in 15 games.	"I don't get many of them, not as many as he gets," Lough said of his third homer in 10 games after getting just one in his first 41, "but it was good to get that up on the board."	Jones is third on the Orioles with 10 homers, but Lough allows manager Buck Showalter to give Jones more time to heal.	"David's abilities allow us to be a little cautious with Adam," Showalter said.	Lough started just three games in center field this season before Jones was hurt.	"I like center field. I've played it in college. I played it in the minor leagues," he said. "I just haven't played it (much) over here, obviously, with Adam Jones."	The Red Sox had a chance to tie it the ninth after Dustin Pedroia's two-out, run-scoring double. But David Ortiz lined out to third as Zach Britton earned his 20th save.	"We were able to scratch out some runs," right fielder Brock Holt said. "We just weren't able to finish it off."	Lough connected off Joe Kelly (2-5) after a sacrifice fly by Ryan Flaherty.	Baltimore made it 5-1 in the fourth on an RBI single by Jimmy Paredes and 6-3 in the sixth on a run-scoring double by Manny Machado.	"He missed off the plate," Boston manager John Farrell said of Kelly. "Then when he mislocated in the zone, it was a good pitch for them to square up."	Boston scored single runs in the third, fourth and fifth off Ubaldo Jimenez (6-3)	Farrell was ejected by plate umpire Tim Timmons after arguing a called third strike to Holt that ended the sixth.	"He gets called out on a pitch that's probably a couple of baseballs off the plate away," Farrell said. "I said a thing probably one too many times."	The Red Sox returned from a promising road trip with renewed hope after winning three of their last four games. They remained a distant last in the AL East but showed signs that their weak hitting was improving by scoring 29 runs in those four games.	But Jimenez, who has allowed three earned runs or less in 12 of his 14 starts, and four relievers from one of baseball's best bullpens held them to eight hits, just two in the last four innings.	The Orioles went ahead in the second when they loaded the bases on singles by the first three batters, Chris Davis, Travis Snyder and J.J. Hardy. After Flaherty's sacrifice fly, Lough, the usual starting left fielder, hit his fourth homer.	The Red Sox cut the lead to 4-1 in the third on a single by Sandy Leon, a double by Mookie Betts and a run-scoring groundout by Holt. They made it 5-2 in the fourth when Hanley Ramirez singled, advanced on a wild pitch and scored on a single by Pablo Sandoval.	They drew within two runs in the fifth when Pedroia and Ortiz walked with two outs and Ramirez singled in Pedroia.	But after Flaherty walked and was sacrificed to second by Lough in the sixth, Machado doubled him home.	FENWAY'S FINALLY FRIENDLY	Jimenez won for the first time in his career in five starts at Fenway Park. "At some point," Showalter said, "the good ones kind of turn that around."	YER OUT!	Boston catcher Leon had a role in three runners who were thrown out. He caught one stealing, threw out another diving back to first and tagged another out at home on an attempted double steal when Leon threw to shortstop Xander Bogaerts, who threw back home.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: Jones sat out for the fifth time in the last seven games with an injured right shoulder. He was the designated hitter in the other two. Jones is hitting .298 with 10 homers and 36 RBI.	Red Sox: C Blake Swihart missed his second straight game with a sprained left foot, but Farrell said he hopes Swihart can play Wednesday night. 3B Sandoval started after missing Boston's last game with a sprained left ankle and went 3 for 4.	UP NEXT	Orioles: Bud Norris (2-5, 7.57 ERA) pitches the second game of the three-game series Wednesday night. After allowing a total of 20 earned runs in his first three starts, his ERA is at its lowest point of the season.	Red Sox: Clay Buchholz (4-6, 3.87) tries to continue a solid stretch in which he's allowed two runs or less in five of his last seven starts. In his last outing, he allowed two earned runs in seven innings in a 5-2 win at Atlanta.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

CLEVELAND --  Don't ask Tigers manager Brad Ausmus to come up with a reason for his team's dominance at Progressive Field.	"I can't explain it," Ausmus said. "I can't give you an answer for that."	David Price allowed one run in 6 2/3 innings and Detroit scored six times in the fifth to beat the the Cleveland Indians 7-3 win on Tuesday night.	The Tigers are 9-2 against the Indians and have won all five games at Progressive Field this season. Detroit is 20-5 in Cleveland over the past three seasons.	Price (7-2) scattered nine hits and struck out seven. The left-hander is 9-1 in his last 11 starts against Cleveland, including a shutout at Comerica Park on June 12.	Miguel Cabrera was 2 for 5 and is hitting .619 (26 for 42) with five homers and 16 RBI in the season series. He's 15 for 22 in five games in Cleveland.	Ironically, Cabrera's weak tapper with the bases loaded in the fifth helped turn the game in Detroit's favor. Danny Salazar (6-3) committed an error on the apparent inning-ending double play grounder that broke a 1-all tie.	Victor Martinez's RBI single, Yoenis Cespedes' two-run single and Nick Castellanos' two-run double completed the scoring, which was also aided by two walks.	"It doesn't bother me how we score six runs," Ausmus said.	Jason Kipnis was 4 for 5 with an RBI and extended his hitting streak to 18 games for the Indians, who have lost 11 of 16 at home.	Price allowed a run in the third on Francisco Lindor's sacrifice fly and worked out of a two-on, one-out jam in the fourth in which he threw 32 pitches.	"I started out good, but the third and fourth inning, not so much," Price said. "The fourth inning was very long, but in the fifth the offense helped me out a lot by putting up a six ball, and we were able to take advantage of the mistake by Salazar."	Detroit loaded the bases with one out in the fifth. Andrew Romine, who homered in the third, led off with a double before Salazar walked Rajai Davis and Ian Kinsler with one out.	Pitching coach Mickey Callaway visited the mound and was ejected by plate umpire Eric Cooper on his way back to the dugout for questioning the strike zone. Manager Terry Francona had heated words with Cooper but remained in the game.	The inning proceeded to get worse for the Indians. Salazar fielded Cabrera's tapper to the left of the mound, but the ball slipped out of his hand as he began to throw home and everyone was safe.	"I tried to rush on the play. Instead of taking the ball out of glove I tried to take it to my hand, that's when I lost it and gave away the game," Salazar said.	Martinez's bloop single and Cespedes' double finished Salazar, who allowed seven runs in 4 1/3 innings. Castellanos doubled off Zach McAllister.	Price sent down the side in order in the fifth and retired seven of the next eight hitters.	GOOD NIGHT TO SIT	Right fielder J.D. Martinez, who has one hit and seven strikeouts in nine career at-bats against Salazar, wasn't in Tuesday's lineup even though he hit three home runs Sunday against the Yankees.	"If he had come out yesterday after hitting three homers and had another good day, I probably would have played him," Ausmus said of Martinez, who was 0 for 4 Monday.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: C Yan Gomes (sore neck) didn't start for the fourth time in five games. Francona said Gomes, 0 for 12 with six strikeouts lifetime against Price, took batting practice and might play Wednesday.	UP NEXT	Tigers: RHP Justin Verlander was supposed to make his third start of the season Wednesday, but he was scratched because of back stiffness. Buck Farmer will start in his place.	Indians: RHP Carlos Carrasco, who has won four of his last six outings, is 1-1 with a 7.20 ERA in two starts against Detroit this season.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

MIAMI --  Carlos Martinez shook off a slow start on the mound, and also a fastball that bruised his pitching arm and left him face down in the batter's box.	Martinez struck out nine in seven innings Tuesday to help the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Miami Marlins 4-3.	The young right-hander trailed 3-0 after 1 1/3 innings before settling down. He retired the final seven batters he faced, including three after taking a 94-mph fastball in the shoulder while trying to bunt in the seventh.	"At that moment I thought, `Oh my God, it's broken," said Martinez (8-3). "But a couple of minutes later I felt great and said I can go the next inning."	With family and friends from his native Dominican Republic in the crowd, including some who had never seen him pitch, Martinez was overthrowing early. He gave up a two-run homer in the first inning to major league home run and RBI leader Giancarlo Stanton, a shot estimated at 484 feet.	"Carlos had high energy, which we don't have a problem with," Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said. "But he was having trouble separating that from how he was throwing. He was heaving. He settled down, though. His last three innings were probably his best."	Martinez allowed eight hits and walked one. He improved to 5-1 with a 1.33 ERA in his past seven starts.	Stanton's homer matched his previous longest this year, and he now has 26 homers, including the longest two in the majors in 2015.	"That was an absolute missile," said Matheny, "one of the furthest balls I've ever seen hit in my life."	But the NL Central leaders rallied. With the score 3-all and two outs in the seventh, Mark Reynolds hit a full-count pitch off the right foot of pitcher Sam Dyson (3-3) for an infield single to put St. Louis ahead.	Earlier in the inning, Martinez was hit in the upper arm by a pitch from Dyson, fell to the ground and was slow to rise.	"I didn't like that at all," Matheny said. "He seems to be OK. It will be interesting to see tonight how it tightens up. I imagine it will a little bit."	Martinez took his base and showed no ill effects when he returned to the mound, throwing one pitch 98 mph. He said he expects to make his next start as scheduled.	Jason Heyward hit his eighth homer for the Cardinals. Trevor Rosenthal pitched around a single in the ninth for his 22nd save in 23 chances.	Stanton's homer, which landed near the beer garden in left field, put Miami ahead 2-0 in the first. It was his 11th homer in June, breaking the club record for the month set by Hanley Ramirez in 2008.	Adeiny Hechavarria had an RBI single in the second for the Marlins, but they went 1 for 8 with runners in scoring position. Miami has lost five of its past six games.	"When you play a team like the Cardinals, there's a reason they have the record that they have," manager Dan Jennings said. "When you get leadoff guys on, you have to get them over and get them in. Unfortunately we didn't do that."	Marlins starter Jose Urena allowed three runs in five innings, his worst outing this month.	Heyward homered into the upper deck in right field in the fourth, and Xavier Scruggs hit a two-run double later in the inning to make it 3-all.	Scruggs, playing in only his fifth game, had three hits. Teammate Jhonny Peralta grounded into two double plays and struck out three times.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: 3B Matt Carpenter sat out with a tight back but was available off the bench.	Marlins: RHP Jarred Cosart (vertigo) is expected to be activated Thursday, but it's unclear when he'll rejoin the rotation. LHP Justin Nicolino, who pitched seven shutout innings in his major league debut Saturday, will get another start, Jennings said. ... 1B Michael Morse (finger) is on a rehab assignment at Triple-A New Orleans and may come off the DL soon.	Umpires: Plate ump Adam Hamari was knocked down and shaken up when hit in the chest protector by a fastball in the eighth inning, but he worked the rest of the game.	UP NEXT	LHP Jaime Garcia (2-3, 1.76), who has pitched 14 consecutive scoreless innings, is scheduled to start Wednesday for the Cardinals against RHP Mat Latos (2-4, 5.37). Garcia will be facing the Marlins for the first time since 2011.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Once again, Chris Archer made it look easy against the Toronto Blue Jays.	The young Tampa Bay pitcher improved to 3-0 this season against the Rays' AL East rivals, limiting the high-scoring Blue Jays to three hits over eight innings in a 4-3 victory Tuesday night that extended the 26-year-old's personal-best winning streak to six straight decisions.	The Blue Jays lead the major leagues in runs scored by a wide margin, but have had an especially tough time stringing together hits against Archer, who is 6-1 in 12 career starts against them.	In three games against Toronto this year, the right-hander has allowed two runs and seven hits while striking out 25 over 22 innings. He walked one and struck out seven Tuesday night, and only one of Toronto's two runs off him was earned.	"With a pitcher like that, I feel like I'm bored because he's striking out everybody. Nobody's hitting ground balls to the shortstop," Tampa Bay's Asdrubal Cabrera said. "I'm enjoying it when he's on the mound."	No wonder.	The first-place Rays have won eight of Archer's past nine starts. This was the 10th time in 16 starts this season he has allowed one earned run or fewer.	"He just continues to go out and impress, especially against that lineup," manager Kevin Cash said. "That's an extremely difficult lineup to have that many at-bats against. They just pick up on your mistakes. It doesn't matter how good your stuff is. They're going to get you eventually, and Arch just kept pumping fastballs and sliders and they just couldn't quite time him up."	Archer agreed.	`It's tricky because they're smart. ... They remember each time you face them, so you try to execute every pitch to your fullest capability," Archer said. "You know you can't slip because if you try to throw a slider, you hang it, it's going to get banged."	Brandon Guyer and Joey Butler had RBI singles for the Rays, with a wild pitch and passed ball setting up both runs off knuckleballer R.A. Dickey (3-7). The Rays scored a third run off the Toronto starter with help from center fielder Kevin Pillar's throwing error and, Cabrera hit a solo homer off Steve Delabar for a 4-2 lead in the eighth.	Edwin Encarnacion's solo homer off Brad Boxberger, who earned his 19th save, trimmed Toronto's deficit to one run in the ninth.	Archer (9-4) limited the Blue Jays to no runs and two hits over seven innings each of the first two times he faced them this year. He held them hitless this time until Dioner Navarro homered with one out in the fifth.	Navarro went deep against his former team for the second straight night, ending the Blue Jays' string of consecutive scoreless innings against Archer at 18. Pillar singled leading off the sixth for the second hit off the Rays starter, and Navarro singled in the seventh to set up a Blue Jays run that scored on first baseman Jake Elmore's error.	Archer's winning streak is the longest of his career. It spans nine starts since his last loss at home against Texas on May 7.	"Chris is going to be good for a very long time. He's one of the best pitchers, not just in the American League, but the whole league," Dickey said. "You know it's going to be a tight game. You can bend a little bit, but you better not break or you're going to be out of it real quick with a guy like that on the other side."	Dickey, who is 0-3 against the Rays this season, allowed three runs and eight hits in seven innings. He walked two and hit two batters, while striking out two in his first start since returning from the bereavement list following the death of his father.	"I'm not ready to re-live any of that," Dickey said. "The organization and my teammates, the support I've received from those guys, some of the classiest moves I've ever been associated with in baseball. It made me feel really good."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: RHP Aaron Sanchez (strained lat) has resumed playing catch.	Rays: LHP Matt Moore (elbow ligament replacement surgery) could make his final minor league rehab start Friday night for Triple-A Durham and return to the rotation next week. "If all goes well, he'll be with us," Cash said. ... RHP Erasmo Ramirez (groin) will have a bullpen session in the next few days and may be back for a start June 30.	BATTER UP: Steven Stamkos and four other members of the NHL's Eastern Conference champion Tampa Bay Lightning -- Ben Bishop, Alex Killorn, Brian Boyle and Braydon Coburn -- took batting practice before the game. Bishop caught the attention of early arrivals in the crowd of 11,474, hitting four home runs. He joined Stamkos, Killorn and Coburn in throwing ceremonial first pitches. The Chicago Blackhawks defeated the Lightning in the Stanley Cup finals in six games.	BULLPEN SHUFFLE	Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said LHP Brett Cecil is out as closer, which could lead to RHP Roberto Osuna taking over the role. Osuna struck out five over two innings in Monday night's 8-5 win over the Rays, picking up his first career save. Cecil has allowed 10 earned runs over his past 5⅔ innings.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays RHP Marco Estrada (5-3, 3.92 ERA) will face Rays RHP Nathan Karns (4-3, 3.53) in Wednesday's series finale.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Oakland Athletics starter Jesse Chavez has already been a hard-luck loser a couple of times this season.	Manager Bob Melvin and the right-hander's teammates feel it was only appropriate for Chavez to get a victory on a night not pitching his best.	Chavez allowed five runs and eight hits over five innings, but exited with the lead that four relievers combined to hold in an 8-6 victory over the Texas Rangers in a series opener Tuesday night.	"Yeah, absolutely, really nice for him," said catcher Josh Phegley, who homered and had a two-run double.	Phegley's double chased rookie Chi Chi Gonzalez (2-2) and tied the game at 5 in the sixth. Phegley scored on Marcus Semien's RBI single to put the A's ahead to stay after Chavez (4-6) had already thrown his last pitch.	"Not only did we get him off the hook, we got him something he deserved," manager Bob Melvin said. "There were so many times that he was a guy left out there with no support with a team that can score some runs."	Chavez has been the loser in two games when Oakland was held scoreless, games in which he allowed one earned run over 14 innings. He struck out three and walked two against the Rangers.	Ben Zobrist also homered for Oakland, which is 18-11 since being 16 games under .500 on May 22.	There was a moment of silence before the game for MLB Network analyst and former player Darryl Hamilton, who was killed Sunday. Hamilton played 13 major league seasons, and his only one in Texas was in 1996 when the Rangers won the AL West and went to the playoffs for the first time.	Rougned Odor had a two-run homer among his three hits for the Rangers, who have their first three-game losing streak since May 14-16. Elvis Andrus drove in two runs and scored early on a passed ball against Phegley.	Drew Pomeranz, the fifth Oakland pitcher, got the final five outs for his first career save.	Gonzalez had allowed only three runs in his first four major league starts, but gave up six runs in 5 2/3 innings against Oakland. The 23-year-old right-hander's ERA more than doubled, from 0.90 to 2.27.	"I just have to stay confident. It was a grind. I struggled. But the team played well and gave me run support," Gonzalez said. "I just have to look at my success and not reflect on the negative. Take out the positives."	BACK IN TOWN	Former Rangers manager Ron Washington was at his first game in Texas since his surprise resignation last September for personal reasons. Now an infield instructor for the A's, Washington was on the field for pregame work and threw batting practice. But he can't be in the dugout for games.	TRADING 4 SPOTS	After Phegley's fourth homer of the season in the fifth made it a 2-1 lead, the Rangers scored four times in the bottom of the inning. But the A's immediately responded with four in the sixth, including Ike Davis' RBI double before Phegley's tying double.	STREAKING A'S	Oakland rookie CF Billy Burns has a 13-game hitting streak, with hits in 25 of his last 26 games ... Zobrist's fifth homer of the season was a two-run shot in the seventh. He has hit .419 (13 for 31) with 15 runs, three homers and 10 RBI over his last nine games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: C Stephen Vogt was out of the lineup after getting a cortisone shot in his left elbow following Sunday's game. He is expected to play Wednesday. ... Switch-pitcher Pat Venditte (strained right shoulder) could be cleared to play catch by the end of the week.	Rangers: 3B Adrian Beltre, who had missed 19 games with a sprained left thumb, was activated before the game even though it still hurts to swing the bat. He had a sac fly and a single. ... OF Josh Hamilton (strained left hamstring) is set to start a rehab assignment Wednesday as the DH for Double-A Frisco. He then will go to Triple-A Round Rock and could rejoin the Rangers by Monday.	UP NEXT	Athletics: Oakland goes for its eighth win in 10 games. Right-hander Kendall Graveman is only the second A's pitcher since at least 1914 to throw at least seven innings and allow two runs or less in three consecutive games without a win in such a span.	Rangers: Texas has lost four games in a row only once this season (April 27-May 1). The Rangers have won the last six starts by lefty Wandy Rodriguez (4-2, 3.20 ERA).	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CHICAGO -- Facing a five-man infield with the bases loaded in the 10th inning, Chris Denorfia did exactly what he wanted to do.	Denorfia hit a game-ending sacrifice fly, and the Chicago Cubs beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 1-0 on Tuesday night for their fourth consecutive victory.	"Obviously that's a situation where I know that all I need to do is hit a fly ball," Denorfia said. "So I tried to just take a deep breath and not try to do too much. Just get a ball that was up in the zone and just get the bottom half of it."	Jason Motte (5-1) pitched a scoreless inning for the win, finishing a three-hitter for Jason Hammel and three relievers. The Cubs' major league-leading eighth victory in extra innings put them nine games over .500 (39-30) for the first time since they were 57-48 in 2009.	"We don't quit," Hammel said. "We're going to keep coming."	Los Angeles has dropped six of eight. It also has lost four consecutive road games to fall to 12-20 away from Dodger Stadium this season.	The Cubs loaded the bases with no outs in the 10th on two singles and a walk. Dodgers manager Don Mattingly then replaced Joel Peralta (1-1) with Kenley Jansen and brought the infield in.	Los Angeles got one out when Addison Russell bounced into a fielder's choice, with first baseman Adrian Gonzalez juggling the ball before making a strong throw to the plate. But Denorfia followed with a line drive to center that Joc Pederson brought in on the run, giving him no chance of making a play.	"You have to take things. Nobody gives you anything here," Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. "You've got to take things, so I love the way our guys are going about their business."	Dodgers right-hander Zack Greinke allowed three hits and walked two in six innings while extending his scoreless streak to 13 frames. The right-hander is 0-2 in his last nine starts despite a 1.79 ERA over that stretch.	"I don't worry about it and just think our team's good and by the end of the year, if everyone does their job, we're going to be all right," Greinke said.	The Cubs nearly got to Greinke in the first, putting runners on second and third with two outs. But Starlin Castro flied out to right to end the inning.	"Zack threw the ball well," Mattingly said. "The bullpen did a nice job for us, gave us a lot of chances."	Hammel allowed two hits in 7 2/3 innings, and one of them was a gift triple for Yasiel Puig in the sixth that was lost in the night sky by outfielders Matt Szczur and Mike Baxter. Hammel then got Pederson to pop out to shortstop, ending the threat.	Hammel struck out six and walked two, bouncing back from a sluggish start at Cleveland on Thursday. The right-hander is 2-0 with a 2.01 ERA in five June outings.	"Fastball command was there tonight, and it makes me a different pitcher," he said.	OH BABY	A man holding a baby made a great barehanded catch over the glove of Gonzalez in the second inning, prompting a replay review.	With two outs and none on, Gonzalez chased Hammel's popup and reached over the rolled-up tarp while trying to make a play, but Keith Hartley, of Chicago, grabbed the ball with his right hand while carrying his 7-month-old son, Isaac, in his left arm.	"I was just feeding him and I saw the ball coming our way and held on to him and made sure I protected him and I stood up and it kind of just fell in my hand," Hartley said.	Mattingly came out of the dugout and argued for fan interference. While the play was being reviewed, the crowd roared as the sequence was shown again on the ballpark's videoboards.	After a brief delay, the call was reversed and Hammel was ruled out, ending the inning.	"It would have been more impressive if the baby would have caught it," Gonzalez deadpanned.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: Mattingly said Cuban INF Hector Olivera has a mild left hamstring strain and is going to Arizona for treatment. Olivera finalized a $62.5 million, six-year contract with Los Angeles in May and was playing for Triple-A Oklahoma City at the time of the injury.	Cubs: CF Dexter Fowler was out of the starting lineup after he sprained his left ankle in the series opener. He walked as a pinch-hitter in the 10th. ... LHP Tsuyoshi Wada played catch after he was pulled from Monday night's 4-2 win due to cramping in the back of his left arm. The team is still hoping he will be able to take his next turn in the rotation Saturday at St. Louis.	UP NEXT	The Cubs send RHP Kyle Hendricks (2-3, 4.28 ERA) to the mound on Wednesday for the third game of the four-game set, while the Dodgers counter with RHP Mike Bolsinger (4-2, 2.87 ERA). Hendricks pitched seven innings in an 8-2 win at Los Angeles on Aug. 1 in his only appearance against the Dodgers. Bolsinger won his only game against the Cubs, pitching into the seventh in a 5-2 victory at Chicago last April.	---	Jay Cohen can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/jcohenap	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

MILWAUKEE --  Carlos Gomez rounded second on Adam Lind's double and it looked as if he was slowing down when third-base coach Ed Sedar started waving him on.	Gomez raced home safely with the tiebreaking run in the seventh inning when outfielder Michael Cuddyer misplayed a double off the wall, helping the Milwaukee Brewers beat the injury-riddled New York Mets 3-2 on Tuesday night.	Just as important to the Brewers, Gomez's sprint around the bases showed he might just be over an upper right leg/hip injury that has slowed him down for much of June.	"I thought he looked pretty good," manager Craig Counsell said. "It was a marked improvement over what we saw" last week.	This is crucial for the Brewers, who are desperately trying to salvage some respectability out of what has been a dismal season. The win on Tuesday improved last-place Milwaukee to 26-46.	Gomez is the Brewers' high-energy ignitor, able to hit for power and has speed. He won a Gold Glove in 2013.	He could be a high-value trade target for other teams or a cornerstone for the Brewers' future rebuilding plans.	For now, Milwaukee will gladly settle for a victory after having lost eight of nine.	For a while on Tuesday, the game had the feel of another frustrating, low-scoring affair that typically hasn't gone the Brewers' way this year. Milwaukee left 11 men on base.	"But we kept putting runners out there and did a good job in the seventh getting another one," Counsell said.	Thanks in large part to Cuddyer.	Gomez had yet to reach third on Adam Lind's double down the left-field line off Sean Gilmartin when the ball took a high hop off the side wall on Cuddyer. The ball bounced just over Cuddyer's glove and trickled through his legs, allowing Gomez to score.	Explained Cuddyer: "If I wait back on that ball, two things can happen: one, it can miss the jet out and go straight to the wall; or, Carlos Gomez beats it anyway. You hope for a good hop but unfortunately, off the cement, it took a bad hop."	FALLING METS	New York lost its sixth straight, falling to .500 (36-36) for the first time since it was 3-3 on April 12.	The Mets placed starting catcher Travis d'Arnaud on the disabled list for the second time this season before the game with a left elbow injury.	The margin of error for the offensively challenged Mets got even tighter with d'Arnaud rejoining middle-of-the-order mainstays David Wright and Daniel Murphy on the disabled list. D'Arnaud spent nearly two months on the DL with a broken right pinkie.	"Nothing's going our way right now," Cuddyer said.	Hansel Robles (1-2) took the loss after allowing Gomez to reach on a walk.	WHAT A RELIEF	Will Smith (3-0) pitched 1 1/3 innings of scoreless relief before Francisco Rodriguez tossed a perfect ninth for his 14th save in 14 chances.	The closer known as "K-Rod" has a 1.04 ERA. He's had a terrific year in spite of inconsistent opportunities because of the Brewers' tough season.	"The more I pitch the better I feel. I need to be out there more often," Rodriguez said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: Collins was hopeful that d'Arnaud would need just the minimum 15 days on the disabled list to recover from his left elbow injury. ... Murphy (left quad) could be ready to start a rehab assignment soon, assistant general manager John Ricco said.	Brewers: Gomez went 1 for 2 with a walk and hit-by-pitch after missing two games in Colorado over the weekend. The injury has bothered him for much of June.	UP NEXT	Mets: Bartolo Colon (9-5) looks to rebound from a tough outing his last time out, when the right-hander allowed seven runs in a 4 1/3 innings in a 7-1 loss to Toronto on Thursday.	Brewers: Jimmy Nelson (3-8) gave up a career-high 11 hits in five innings in his last outing, a 3-2 loss Thursday to Kansas City. The young right-hander is 0-1 with a 2.25 ERA in two career starts against the Mets.	---	Follow Genaro Armas at http://twitter.com/GArmasAP	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

MINNEAPOLIS --  The Chicago White Sox woke up their lagging lineup.	Jeff Samardzija appreciated the support -- and enjoyed the show.	Samardzija struck out seven batters in seven innings for just his second win in nine starts on the road this season, and the White Sox beat the Minnesota Twins 6-2 Tuesday to snap a seven-game losing streak away from Chicago.	"This is the kind of game that we expect every day to have," said Jose Abreu, through his translator, after a career-high four hits.	Geovany Soto had two RBI singles and Melky Cabrera drove in the go-ahead run on a two-out single seventh to give Samardzija (5-4) the victory, sending Twins starter Mike Pelfrey (5-4) to his first loss in seven starts at home this year. The White Sox stopped another slide by topping three runs for the first time in 10 games, their longest such run since 1976.	"After the first inning you can fall into the trap of `it's not happening,' and guys stayed with it," manager Robin Ventura said.	The White Sox had eight of their 15 hits with two outs for four RBI. They had two-plus hits with runners in scoring position for the first time in 19 games, going 5 for 16.	"I don't know how to explain it, but we needed it today," said Abreu, who's batting .393 in his last 14 games.	Samardzija has allowed 19 first-inning runs, the most in the majors, in 15 starts. Eddie Rosario added to the total with a homer, but Torii Hunter grounded into a double play with two runners on.	"That was huge, for sure. You've got to make those pitches if you want to have a good day," said Samardzija, who gave up eight of his majors-most 118 hits allowed.	He won for the first time in six starts since May 22, which was also against the Twins, by logging seven innings for the fourth straight turn.	"You know you're probably going to have to find a way to hold on, because he gets stronger as the game goes on," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.	Hunter was hit by a two-out pitch in the fourth inning, advanced on Eduardo Nunez's infield single and scored on Kurt Suzuki's double to give the Twins a 2-1 lead, but Nunez was out easily trying to score from first on assists from Cabrera in left field and Alexei Ramirez at shortstop.	Suzuki grounded out with two on and two out in the sixth. Byron Buxton was caught trying to steal second after a one-out single in the seventh, thanks to a sharp throw by Soto. Ventura raved about Samardzija's ability to keep Buxton from taking a large lead.	Pelfrey's ERA at home this season is still a sparkling 1.80. He allowed 10 hits, three runs and three walks in 6 2/3 innings, but Cabrera's sharp single on a 1-0 sinker made his night look less impressive after Molitor visited the mound and pondered a change.	"I knew coming in that it was going to be tough with him on the mound and how good he is. He outpitched me. That's the story right there," Pelfrey said.	The White Sox also ended a six-game losing streak at Target Field during which they were outscored 55-14.	NO REST FOR RAMIREZ	Ramirez has been slumping as badly as anyone for the White Sox, batting .170 in his last 14 games, but Ventura said he doesn't see any fatigue.	"There are times when you do give him that day, and I don't think this is that time," Ventura said.	BUXTON BACK DOWN	After tallying three runs on three hits the night before, his first game in the leadoff spot, Buxton batted ninth again because of the challenging right-against-right matchup with Samardzija. Molitor, on whether he considered leaving Buxton at the top: "The fan in me was."	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox: RHP Matt Albers will start a rehab assignment Wednesday with Triple-A Charlotte, one step closer to returning from a broken little finger on his right hand.	Twins: RHP Ricky Nolasco finally received the orthotic device to relieve pain in his right ankle. He threw lightly before the game and will take the mound later this week.	UP NEXT	Chris Sale (6-3, 2.74 ERA) will pitch for the White Sox Wednesday in the series finale, having struck out at least 12 batters in each of his last five starts to match Pedro Martinez (1999) and Randy Johnson (1998) for the major league record.	Phil Hughes (5-6, 4.47 ERA) will start for the Twins, coming off his strongest appearance of the season. He beat the Cubs with eight innings and one run on two hits.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

DENVER --  Nolan Arenado has taken his power surge to new heights.	Arenado hit two home runs, including a go-ahead three-run shot in Colorado's six-run fifth inning, and the Rockies rallied to beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 10-5 on Tuesday night.	It was Arenado's third career two-homer game, the second this season, and pushed his home run total for the year to a career-best 19.	"If you had told me in spring training I would have hit 19 home runs by this point, I would have said, `No shot," Arenado said. "I've just been putting some good swings on the ball and luckily they have been going out. It's just nice to hit the ball hard and help my team win."	He wasn't the only one.	Wilin Rosario, D.J. LeMahieu and Brandon Barnes also homered to help Kyle Kendrick (3-9) win at Coors Field for the first time in seven home starts since signing with Colorado in the offseason as a free agent. The game included a 38-minute weather delay because of lightning and a brief downpour.	"We're starting to swing the bats. It's nice to see the offense starting to take off," said manager Walt Weiss after the Rockies' third win in a row.	Kendrick withstood back to back home runs in the second inning by Welington Castillo and Nick Ahmed and a solo shot by A.J. Pollock in the fifth to improve to 1-4 this season at Coors Field. He allowed four runs on eight hits in six innings.	"You can give up three, four runs here and most of the time, you're going to win with our offense," Kendrick said. "It was a nice win for us."	Chase Anderson (3-2) gave up a season-high eight runs on eight hits in 4 2/3 innings, his shortest outing of the year. The three homers he surrendered matched his total for the season coming into the game. It was also the first time the opposition had gone deep in his last nine starts on the road.	The rain delay "had nothing to do with it," Diamondbacks manager Chip Hale said. "He just elevated the ball too much and they had good at bats against him. I don't remember one swing at a ball out of the zone."	Arenado led off the fourth inning by driving Anderson's first offering into the left field bleachers, pulling Colorado to within 3-2 with his 18th homer of the season.	Pollock connected off Kendrick in the fifth for his ninth of the season, but the Rockies took control in their half of the fifth.	Charlie Blackmon hit an RBI double, and after LeMahieu walked, Troy Tulowitzki hit a run-scoring single to even the score at 4-all. Arenado followed by hitting his 19th homer, a career-high, and putting the Rockies up 7-4. His four RBI matched a career high.	One out later, Rosario homered, finishing Anderson.	"You can't leave the ball up, you pay for it," Anderson said.	LeMahieu homered in the seventh and Barnes in the eighth for the Rockies, who had a season high five homers in the game.	GIMME SHELTER	Bad weather has caused 15 in-game delays or outright postponements during an unusually stormy season at Coors Field. Time lost to weather-related interruptions is now up to 17 hours, 25 minutes over 11 games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: RHP Jeremy Hellickson remains on schedule for his next start, for now. He bruised his left hip when he was hit by a pitch Sunday and in a later plate appearance, aggravated the hip injury swinging the bat. But Manager Chip Hale said Hellickson has shown steady improvement in the last couple days and should be good to go so long as his pending side session goes well.	Rockies: OF Carlos Gonzalez was held out of Tuesday's game with a left hand strain. He suffered the injury swinging the bat during Sunday's game against Milwaukee. "Right now, we think it's going to be a day to day deal," manager Walt Weiss said. "One or two days. With the hand, it's always a little concerning with hitters. But I feel like it's not too serious."	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: A winner in his Diamondbacks debut earlier this month, RHP Allen Webster (1-1) will try to get back on track after a rough interleague outing last time out in which he gave up six runs in 5 1/3 innings in the Diamondbacks' 7-1 loss to the Los Angeles Angels.	ROCKIES: RHP David Hale (2-2), coming off back to back losses, will look to break the skid when he makes his sixth start of the season.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Touted rookie Carlos Correa is off to a blazing start, helping the Houston Astros maintain their lofty position in the AL West.	Correa hit a mammoth three-run homer off C.J. Wilson, his fourth in 15 big league games, and Luis Valbuena went deep twice to power the Astros to a 13-3 rout of the Los Angeles Angels on Tuesday night.	"I wouldn't say I'm surprised. I'm just going out there and having fun," Correa said. "All the work I've put in the offseason and spring training has paid off."	Correa drove a full-count pitch over both bullpens in left field with two outs in the second, giving Houston a 4-0 lead after singles by Valbuena and former Angel Hank Conger. Correa's three hits raised his total to 20, breaking the franchise record for a player in his first 15 big league games. The old mark was 19, by Doug Rader (1967) and Josh Anderson (2007).	"He's not a secret anymore. He's a good player, and he's very comfortable up here," manager A.J. Hinch said. "He's not scared off by the moment and he's not timid at all."	The 20-year-old shortstop ended up with four RBI, the last one in the ninth after rookie shortstop Taylor Featherston bobbled his routine grounder with the bases loaded -- preventing the Angels from turning what should have been an easy inning-ending double play.	"I feel comfortable working with this group of players," Correa said. "When you've got guys like George Springer, who's having a great month hitting in front of me and getting on base, and guys behind you like Jose Altuve, who's one of the greatest hitters in the game, you just feel confident."	The AL West-leading Astros have homered in 10 straight games, their longest streak since a 12-game stretch in 2007. They lead the majors with 107 home runs and 31 multihomer games, improving their record to 29-2 when they've hit more than one.	Collin McHugh (8-3) pitched a season-high eight innings, allowing two runs on nine hits and striking out six. The right-hander escaped a bases-loaded jam in the first after a two-out intentional walk to AL home run leader Albert Pujols.	Wilson (5-6) was charged with a season-worst seven earned runs and eight hits over 3 1/3 innings in his shortest outing of 2015.	The inconsistent left-hander allowed one run over 15 innings with 17 strikeouts in his previous two starts. In his two starts before that, both losses, he yielded 11 runs in losses.	"When you give up that many runs I guess in that short of an outing, not a lot is working," Wilson said.	The Astros increased the margin to 7-0 with three runs in the fourth, including a leadoff homer by Valbuena, who came in batting in the eighth spot with a .186 average.	"He's not getting a lot of hits to improve his batting average, but he does damage," Hinch said. "When you watch him every day, he doesn't seem like a guy who's hitting under .200."	Wilson was replaced by Cam Bedrosian later that inning after loading the bases with a one-out intentional walk to Altuve. Evan Gattis then hit a sacrifice fly, and Correa scored on a wild pitch after hitting a double.	The Angels got on the board in the fourth with a two-run single by No. 9 hitter Efren Navarro, after loading the bases with Carlos Perez's two-out single off McHugh's glove.	But Valbuena responded in the fifth with a two-run homer that made it 9-2, driving Bedrosian's 1-1 pitch just beyond the reach of Kole Calhoun as he made a diving attempt at the short fence in the right field corner and disappeared into the first row of seats.	It was Valbuena's career-high 19th home run, the most ever by an Astros third baseman through the team's first 73 games. The previous record was set in 2006 by Morgan Ensberg, who finished that season with 23.	"I'm not trying to hit a home run every time. I just try to hit the ball hard, and it goes," Valbuena said.	Gattis drove in a run with a first-inning double after Correa singled and advanced to third on a wild pitch and a balk. It was the 10th consecutive game that the Astros scored first, and eighth time they plated a run in the opening inning.	UP NEXT	Astros: RHP Lance McCullers (3-2) has a 2.45 ERA through his first seven big league starts, including a complete-game four-hitter on June 3 against Baltimore.	Angels: RHP Matt Shoemaker (4-5) lost a 6-5 decision against Houston at the "Big A" on May 9, giving up six runs and three homers in three innings. It was one of four starts this season in which he allowed five or more earned runs -- something he did only once in 20 starts last season, when he set a club rookie record with 16 wins.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SEATTLE -- In just his fifth major league start, Seattle rookie Mike Montgomery gave himself a lofty goal.	Not to mention quite a memory, all of it coming against Kansas City, the team that originally drafted Montgomery.	"I probably had a little more emotion going in than I normally do," Montgomery said. "I know a lot of those guys. I was with them for five years. It was definitely a little extra added on to it."	Montgomery tossed a gem on Tuesday night against Kansas City, throwing a four-hitter and striking out 10 in Seattle's 7-0 victory. In the process, Montgomery became the first Mariners left-hander to ever throw a shutout with at least 10 strikeouts and no walks.	For a franchise that's had lefties like Mark Langston, Randy Johnson and Jamie Moyer during its history, that's not a small accomplishment.	"It was fun though because I played with them for a couple of years and to now face them and face them in the big leagues it was a cool experience," Montgomery said. "I'll remember them for a long time."	The achievement was even more surprising considering the trouble Montgomery found himself in after throwing just seven pitches in the first inning. Kansas City loaded the bases on singles by Alcides Escobar and Mike Moustakas and a pitch that hit Lorenzo Cain to load the bases.	But a strikeout of Eric Hosmer and double play got Montgomery out of the inning. The first two batters of the second reached, but then Montgomery took over, striking out the side and starting a string of 17 straight retired before shortstop Brad Miller's error with two outs in the seventh.	"I really felt confident. After that third inning a switch flipped and I had confidence in all of my stuff," Montgomery said. "It was just executing, and getting ahead early and putting them away."	Montgomery was originally drafted by the Royals, but was eventually traded to Tampa Bay before landing in Seattle via trade before the start of this season. Montgomery (2-2) became the second Mariner this season to toss a complete game, joining Felix Hernandez, and he became the 10th rookie in Seattle history to toss a complete game.	While Montgomery was the star, Dustin Ackley wasn't far behind. Ackley singled, doubled and homered for his first three-hit game of the season. Ackley had only one two-hit game all season, but lined a ground-rule double in his first at-bat against Jeremy Guthrie (5-5) and added a single his next time up that eluded the glove of Alex Gordon's sliding attempt in left field.	But the big blow was Ackley's fifth homer of the season, a two-run shot off the top of the wall in right-center that gave Seattle a 6-0 lead. Ackley is 9 of 13 with four doubles and three home runs against Guthrie in his career.	Ackley nearly got the triple he needed for the cycle when he came up in the seventh, but his drive to deep left-center was tracked down by Cain.	"Cain, I played with him in the past and I know his kind of speed. ... It wasn't surprising when he came down with it," Ackley said.	Miller walked with the bases loaded in the third for Seattle's first run and Mike Zunino followed with an RBI single, snapping an 0-for-14 skid that included 11 strikeouts.	"One run at a time they just kind of kept tacking them on. ... It all kind of happened quickly," Guthrie said.	RING TONE	Raul Ibanez, part of the Royals' roster last season before retiring, was presented with his AL championship ring in a pregame ceremony in the clubhouse.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: Nelson Cruz was back in the lineup a day after popping his pelvic bone out of place and having it put back. Cruz will likely be the designated hitter for a little while to make sure he doesn't aggravate the injury.	UP NEXT:	Royals: Danny Duffy (2-3) will pitch for the first time since May 16 in the series finale on Wednesday. Duffy went on the 15-day DL on May 25 with left biceps tendinitis. Duffy made two rehab starts at Triple-A Omaha.	Mariners: Roenis Elias (4-4) looks for his second straight win after striking out 10 in a victory over Houston his last time out.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Will Venable doubled home the tying runs against Madison Bumgarner and then got himself picked off second on a dribbler to the mound.	He chased the World Series MVP from the game and that might have been his biggest contribution.	Alexi Amarista singled in the go-ahead run and the San Diego Padres beat the San Francisco Giants 3-2 in 11 innings Tuesday night.	"A lot of people did a lot of good things," Venable said. "It wasn't happening for us offensively early in the game."	Brandon Maurer (5-0) pitched two scoreless innings to earn the victory while Craig Kimbrel earned his 18th save.	Derek Norris doubled against Hunter Strickland (0-1) with one out in the 11th and eventually scored when Amarista's grounder tipped off Strickland's glove and out of the reach of second baseman Joe Panik.	"Bad break there," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "That's a tough one to lose. Bum threw so well again. We just couldn't add on."	Bumgarner retired the first 14 hitters he faced, 10 by strikeout. Brandon Crawford dove to catch Yangervis Solarte's liner just before Yonder Alonso blooped a single into right to break up Bumgarner's bid for a perfect game.	Bumgarner allowed two runs on five hits over 7 1/3 innings. He walked one and struck out a career-high 14.	"I've watched that kid compete," Padres manager Pat Murphy said. "He's as good as there is."	Gregor Blanco and Panik each drove in runs in the fifth to give the Giants an early edge.	Alonso walked and Will Middlebrooks doubled to open the eighth. After Bumgarner struck out Clint Barmes, Venable delivered.	Odrisamr Despaigne cruised through the first four innings and was seemingly out of the fifth but could not cleanly handle Blanco's slow roller in front of the plate.	He had given up one run in his previous 29 1/3 innings against the Giants. Despaigne allowed two runs on five hits. He walked two and struck out two	Sergio Romo left the game after getting two outs in the top of the ninth with a hyperextended knee.	Padres manager Pat Murphy earned his first career ejection, from home plate umpire Fieldin Culbreth, for arguing balls and strikes in the eighth. Matt Kemp was also ejected.	SF SIGHTSEEING:	In all the years he spent coaching at Arizona State, Murphy never once watched a game at AT&T Park, until Tuesday night. He took his son on a tour of Alcatraz Island during Monday's off day and then took a walk around the stadium before the series opener. "I got to meet Hunter Pence," he said. "That was special. I love the way he plays." Murphy coached Giants hitting coach Hensley "Bam Bam" Muelens when both were with the 2000 Netherlands team that qualified for the Seoul Olympics. Muelens celebrated his 48th birthday Tuesday.	TRAINING TABLE:	Padres: Right-hander Brandon Morrow (right shoulder inflammation) is close to throwing a bullpen session or two, which would lead to a simulated game and a possible rehab assignment. "It doesn't look too far off," Murphy said. ... Left-hander Cory Luebke (Tommy John surgery) threw an inning with Double-A San Antonio, giving up a two-run homer. He walked two and struck out two.	Giants: Right-handers Matt Cain (flexor tendon strain) and Jake Peavy (back strain) will each get one more rehab start and will most likely rejoin the Giants on their road trip to Miami and Washington. ... Outfielder Nori Aoki was scratched from the lineup with a fracture in his leg.	UP NEXT:	Padres: Ian Kennedy (4-5, 5.43) is 2-0 over his last four starts following a four-game losing streak. He's lowered his ERA from 7.15 with a 2.63 ERA during his winning streak.	Giants: Ryan Vogelsong (5-5, 4.38) is coming off one of his best starts of the season, a three-hitter over 6 2/3 innings in a 7-0 win at Seattle. He's still 1/3 over his past four starts, having allowed 12 earned runs over the three losses, a span of 16 1/3 innings	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CLEVELAND --  There was a humongous hole in Detroit's lineup, and the Indians took advantage of it.	Carlos Carrasco kept the AL's best hitting team -- missing slugger Miguel Cabrera -- in check for eight innings and Cleveland won its first home game this season against the Tigers, 8-2 on Wednesday.	Carrasco (9-6) carried a two-hit shutout into the seventh before giving up a two-run homer to J.D. Martinez. The right-hander allowed five hits, struck out seven and didn't have to deal with the fearsome Cabrera, who came in batting .619 against the Indians this season but was given a day off.	Indians manager Terry Francona nearly fell off his chair when describing how it felt not to see Detroit's No. 24 coming to the plate.	"Ohhhhh, like you can't believe," Francona said. "His presence in that lineup, when you get down to the bottom of the order, you're thinking, well, if this guy gets on he's coming up. But he could not get a bat today to reach the plate and that was a good feeling."	The Indians came in 0-5 against the four-time defending AL Central champions in Cleveland this season and were just 5-20 at Progressive Field versus the Tigers since the start of 2013.	"We'd much rather take the series from them," closer Cody Allen said. "But they've had our number here the last couple years, that's no secret."	Cleveland's Jason Kipnis, the league's leading hitter, extended his hitting streak to 19 games, and rookie Francisco Lindor hit his first career homer off Buck Farmer (0-2) to help the Indians salvage the series finale and improve to 15-23 at home.	The Indians caught a break before the game even began as the Tigers rested Cabrera, who has destroyed Cleveland pitching throughout his career but especially this season, when he seems to hit a line drive every time up. Manager Brad Ausmus wanted to give his star slugger a day to relax.	"Even Superman needs a day off," Ausmus said of Cabrera, hitting an absurd .682 (15 for 22) in Cleveland this year. "People say, `How can you give Miggy a day off? But if you get through 162 games and he doesn't have a day off, they'll also say, `How can you not give him a day off?"	Without Cabrera in the middle of their lineup, the Tigers were missing their biggest bat and they never got going against Carrasco, who came in with a 6.93 ERA against Detroit.	The right-hander tried to downplay the absence of Cabrera, but the Tigers just aren't the same team without him.	"It's a little bit different," Carrasco said. "But you know what? You have to battle, you have to do your job and everything. It doesn't matter if he's playing or not. It's more important you make good pitches. That's what you need to do."	Farmer was called up from Triple-A Toledo to start for Detroit in place of Justin Verlander, scratched with a stiff back. Farmer allowed five runs and eight hits in 5 1/3 innings.	After playing from behind against the Tigers all season, the Indians took a 3-0 lead in the third on Michael Brantley's RBI single and Carlos Santana's two-out, two-run double.	Farmer struck out five straight Cleveland hitters before Kipnis singled with one out in the third to extend his hitting streak at home to 28 straight games -- the longest at home for an Indians player since Miguel Dilone in 1980.	Lindor reached on a broken-bat single before Brantley pulled a single to right. David Murphy singled and Santana followed with a shot to the gap in right-center, just his fourth hit in 27 at-bats during the eight-game homestand.	Lindor, who has shown he's major league-ready defensively, connected for his first homer with one out in the fifth to make it 4-0.	"I'm not used to hitting home runs," the 21-year-old said. "I knew I got something good, but I saw J.D. turn around. I was just trying to go two, but it went over the fence. I'm happy."	KIPNIS KORNER	During his 28-game home hitting streak, Kipnis is batting .500 (54 of 108) with 17 doubles, three homers and 15 RBI. His streak is the longest in the majors this season and the best since Colorado's Carlos Gonzalez hit in 29 consecutive home games in 2012.	"He's been a force," Francona said. "He's been one of the best players in the game."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: C Yan Gomes drove in two runs after missing three straight games with a stiff neck. He was itching to return, sending a text message to his manager at 1:30 a.m. "He declared himself ready to play," Francona said. "He said, `I've got to play."	UP NEXT	Tigers: Alfredo Simon (7-4) starts as Detroit returns home to begin a four-game series -- and nine-game homestand -- against the White Sox, who will send LHP Carlos Rodon (3-1) to the mound.	Indians: Following an off day, Corey Kluber, who has received two or fewer runs of support in 11 of 15 starts, opens a three-game series in Baltimore against lefty Wei-Yin Chen.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Marco Estrada made a run at history for the second consecutive start and came up just short again.	Estrada lost his bid for a perfect game on Logan Forsythe's infield single with one out in the eighth inning, but Chris Colabello homered in the 12th to lift the Toronto Blue Jays over the Tampa Bay Rays 1-0 on Wednesday.	Estrada also carried a no-hit bid into the eighth inning of his previous start Friday against Baltimore. This time, he struck out 10 and threw a career-high 129 pitches.	"He's been on some kind of roll," Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said.	Forsythe barely beat out a slow chopper to third that Josh Donaldson fielded barehanded. Donaldson's throw to first was just a hair too late.	"It was a little frustrating just because it wasn't hit very hard," Estrada said. "Donaldson made a great play. The guy can run a little bit, so he beat it out."	Toronto challenged the safe call by umpire Joe West, which was confirmed after a 40-second replay review.	"It wasn't a pretty hit, but it was a hit," Forsythe said. "But hats off to him."	Tampa Bay's only other hit off Estrada was Kevin Kiermaier's two-out double in the ninth that chased the right-hander.	"The ninth inning, I gave up a hard-hit ball to Kiermaier. That made it a little better," Estrada said. "Easier to forget about."	Colabello connected for a one-out shot to center off Brandon Gomes (1-3).	It was the Blue Jays' first homer in the 12th inning or later to break a scoreless tie since Jesse Barfield did it on Sept. 26, 1986, at Boston.	"I'm proud of the guys, but that's what they're made of. This is a more character team than we've had in the past," Gibbons said.	Brett Cecil (2-4) escaped a bases-loaded jam in the 11th, and Steve Delabar got three outs for his first save of the season.	Donaldson dove a couple of rows into the stands to catch David DeJesus' foul pop leading off the eighth.	"I thought it was pretty neat," Donaldson said. "I was just trying to do anything I can to help get outs at that time."	Nathan Karns took a no-hit bid into the sixth for the Rays, but exited one inning later after giving up consecutive singles to Edwin Encarnacion and Dioner Navarro. Kevin Jepsen pitched out of the jam by getting three straight outs.	Karns gave up three hits, three walks and struck out five over six-plus innings.	Kevin Pillar got the game's first hit, a one-out single to left in the sixth. Karns later got an inning-ending pop fly from Jose Bautista with the bases loaded.	Encarnacion was the lone baserunner through five innings, drawing a leadoff walk in the second. He appeared to lose track of the outs and was easily doubled off second base after taking off for third on Russell Martin's one-out fly to center.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: Gibbons said rookie 2B Devon Travis (shoulder) is expected back Friday after missing 36 games.	Rays: James Loney (broken left middle finger) hit off a tee and played catch for the first time, and manager Kevin Cash said there is a chance the first baseman could return before the All-Star break. ... RHP Jake Odorizzi (oblique) is scheduled to throw batting practice Saturday.	NUMBERS GAME	The Blue Jays are 2-26 when scoring three runs or fewer. ...

NEW YORK -- Ivan Nova went to bed about 10 p.m. He couldn't sleep.	When he returned to Yankee Stadium on Wednesday for his first major league appearance in 14 months, he left the Philadelphia Phillies' lumber in a slumber.	Nova stifled the Phillies on three hits over 6 2/3 scoreless innings in his comeback from Tommy John surgery, leading the New York Yankees to a 10-2 win over Philadelphia and Cole Hamels.	"I almost cried when I was walking by the tunnel," Nova said. "When I first walked onto the mound, I didn't believe it."	The 28-year-old right-hander had not pitched in the majors since April 19, 2014, when he gave up a career-high four homers in a loss at Tampa Bay. He had Tommy John surgery 10 days later and the Yankees, seeking to stabilize an erratic rotation, activated him after three minor league rehab outings.	With a fastball that reached 95 mph, Nova walked two and struck out one. He threw 51 of 92 pitches for strikes and retired 11 batters on flyouts, including eight to center fielder Brett Gardner.	"Exactly what we needed," Mark Teixeira said. "It looked like he didn't miss any time, didn't skip a beat."	Nova (1-0) waved his cap and pointed it toward fans as he walked off to a standing ovation from the crowd of 45,877 on a sunny afternoon.	"Before the game, you could just tell he was a little amped up, rightfully so," catcher John Ryan Murphy said.	Nova followed poor outings by Masahiro Tanaka, Michael Pineda and CC Sabathia, who all failed to reach the sixth inning during defeats. Nova's return could mean Adam Warren will eventually be dropped from the rotation, which began the day 23rd among the 30 teams in ERA.	"I thought his sinker was really good, his curveball was really good, his command of the strike zone ... everything -- his pace," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.	A focus of constant trade speculation, Hamels (5-6) allowed five runs in five innings, partly because of poor defense. He started to get in trouble in the second when Chris Young singled and Murphy walked. Didi Gregorius bunted a chopper off the plate, and catcher Carlos Ruiz, after waiting for the ball to drop, threw it late to first as Gregorius reached on an infield hit that loaded the bases.	With the infield in, Jose Pirela hit a two-hopper to third baseman Andres Blanco, who grabbed the ball with his bare hand and then bounced a one-hop throw off Ruiz's mitt as two runs scored, one on the error.	New York made it 5-0 in the fourth after shortstop Freddy Galvis allowed Gregorius' popup to drop for a double. Pirela walked, Gardner singled in a run and Chase Headley's grounder over third base went off Galvis' glove and down the left-field line for an RBI double.	Back in the lineup after missing two games with neck stiffness that required a cortisone injection, Teixeira followed with a run-scoring single, the second of his three hits.	Alex Rodriguez added a two-run single in the seventh off Justin De Fratus, moving past Al Kaline for sole possession of 27th place with his 3,008th hit	Nova and the rest of the Yankees headed off for a trip to Houston and the Los Angeles Angels. Nova anticipated having trouble sleeping on the flight.	"Somebody told me that I'd sleep well before," he said. "I'm telling you he's a liar. I didn't sleep very well."	SCORING SPLURGE	New York had played four consecutive games in which teams combined for 16 runs or more for the first time since five straight in May 1936, according to STATS.	NEIGHBORHOOD	Mel Stottlemyre's plaque was affixed next to Joe Torre's in Monument Park. The former Yankees pitcher and coach, surprised by the honor last weekend, had asked that it be placed there. Stottlemyre served as Yankees pitching coach while Torre was the team's manager.	BYE, BYE	Girardi was ejected from the dugout by first base umpire Alan Porter following Maikel Franco's checked swing in the third on an 0-2 pitch with two on and two outs. "I told him he swung. He said something, and I said he swung, and he said knock it off, and I said I'd knock it off if you got the call right. And he threw me," Girardi said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: LHP Andrew Miller, sidelined since June 9 because of a strained forearm, threw 25 times from 60 feet on flat ground, his first action since the injury.	UP NEXT	Yankees: Pushed back a day to make room for Nova, Warren (5-4) starts at AL West-leading Houston against LHP Dallas Keuchel (8-3) on Thursday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Phil Hughes and the Minnesota Twins were undeterred by Chris Sale's strikeout streak for the Chicago White Sox.	Why would they be, with all due respect to the lanky left-hander? Sale has become one of baseball's best pitchers, but not against the Twins this year.	Hughes pitched eight strong innings on his birthday and Minnesota beat Sale for the third time this season, overcoming 10 more strikeouts by the three-time All-Star in a 6-1 victory Wednesday.	"He's definitely pitched very well against us a lot of times, so it's hard to say you have his number -- but this year obviously we've had some success," said Kurt Suzuki, who had two hits and an RBI for the Twins.	Sale (6-4) reached double digits in strikeouts for the seventh straight game, the longest stretch since Randy Johnson in 2001. Sale was trying to become the first pitcher in modern major league history with at least 12 strikeouts in six consecutive starts.	His streak of innings with at least one strikeout was stopped at 38 when the Twins hit three doubles in a three-run fourth to give Hughes (6-6) the lead for good.	"I appreciate it, and it's cool, but it'd be a lot better if we were winning more games, for sure," Sale said after the White Sox fell to an AL-worst 13-25 on the road.	Sale is 1/3 with a 6.46 ERA in four turns against the Twins this season. Against everyone else in the majors, he is 5-1 with a 1.88 ERA in 10 starts.	"The mood was pretty good in here about what we had to do," Hughes said.	Sale allowed eight hits, one walk and six runs (five earned) in 6 2/3 innings. He left during a three-run seventh amid another stretch of sloppy defense by the White Sox, who have lost his last three starts.	"It just gives you a feeling that if you grind it out, you might have a chance to find a way," Twins manager Paul Molitor said. "He's one of those guys that, he's going to make you look bad from time to time, but you've got to look at each at-bat and each inning as a new opportunity."	Adam LaRoche, who had three hits, homered to start the second, but Hughes settled in smoothly to win with eight innings and one run allowed for the second straight time. He gave up six hits and struck out five without a walk, lowering his ERA to 4.20 on his 29th birthday.	"Obviously a tough start to my year, but a lot of games ahead of us and this team's doing a lot of good things and I want to be in there in the end," Hughes said.	Brian Dozier and Shane Robinson had two hits for the Twins, who are 9-4 against the White Sox this year while outscoring them 78-35.	"If you feel like you give up more than two you're going to get beat, it's tough to pitch like that," White Sox manager Robin Ventura said. "We've got a lot of room for improvement on offense."	SETTING SALE	Sale's strikeout/innings streak was the longest since Johan Santana struck out at least one batter over 39 straight innings in 2002 for the Twins. Only Pedro Martinez (1999) and Johnson (1998) had whiffed at least 12 over five straight starts since 1914, according to STATS research.	ROSTER MOVE	The Twins sent right-hander Michael Tonkin, who has a 5.73 ERA in 16 appearances, to Triple-A Rochester after the game. Molitor declined to elaborate on whether the Twins would stick with eight relievers or Tonkin would be replaced by a position player.	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox: Alexei Ramirez, who has started all but two games at SS, made his ninth error of the season and went 0 for 4 to drop his batting average to .220.	Twins: OF Aaron Hicks (strained right forearm) is scheduled to start a rehab assignment Friday with Triple-A Rochester. GM Terry Ryan wouldn't speculate on whether Hicks would return to the team when he's eligible to come off the disabled list Monday. "No promises," Ryan said.	UP NEXT	The White Sox play Detroit on Thursday, with Carlos Rodon (3-1, 3.75 ERA) pitching against Tigers RHP Alfredo Simon (7-4, 3.29 ERA) to begin a four-game set.	The Twins have Thursday off before traveling to Milwaukee. Trevor May (4-5, 4.03 ERA) takes the mound Friday against the Brewers.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Taylor Featherston's first game-ending hit in the majors came against his hometown team in the heat of a pennant race.	The rookie third baseman poked an RBI single over first base with two outs in the 13th inning to give the Los Angeles Angels a 2-1 victory over the Houston Astros on Wednesday. It was his first hit in 22 career at-bats at Angel Stadium.	"You see it all the time on TV growing up," Featherston said of his postgame Gatorade shower. "We've had a couple this year, and I felt that sooner or later, my time would come. That's what it's all about -- getting it done with the game on the line. Going into an off-day with a series win is huge."	Erick Aybar greeted Joe Thatcher (1-2) with a leadoff single, advanced on Daniel Robertson's sacrifice and went to third on Efren Navarro's groundout. Chad Qualls walked Chris Iannetta before Featherston came through in the rubber game of the three-game series to help the Angels climb within 4 1/2 games of the AL West-leading Astros.	"It was a slider. I saw that he was throwing Iannetta a bunch of them," Featherston said. "After he threw me the first one and I swung through it, I thought he probably was going to come back to it again -- and I got enough of it."	Surprise starter Andrew Heaney pitched well in his Angels debut, locking horns with Lance McCullers in a matchup of touted young arms selected in the first round of the 2012 draft.	"Those are two really good young pitchers and they both pitched great today," Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. "McCullers was very effective and he had all his pitches working. Heaney was throwing a ton of strikes early. We put a lot of balls in play, but didn't have a lot of baserunners."	Jose Alvarez (2-1) pitched 1 2/3 scoreless innings for the win.	Joe Smith, working his second inning of relief for the Angels, did not retire any of the three batters he faced in the ninth. Preston Tucker led off with a single, but pinch-runner George Springer was picked off before the next pitch. Evan Gattis tried to stretch a single to left field into a double and was thrown out by Robertson.	Another Astros pinch-runner was cut down in the 10th when Marwin Gonzalez was thrown out trying to steal second.	"They were aggressive mistakes," Hinch said.	Robertson entered in the eighth as a pinch-hitter for Matt Joyce and singled with one out against Tony Sipp. Robertson made it to third on Iannetta's two-out single, but Pat Neshek came in and struck out pinch-hitter David Freese.	Heaney allowed a run and four hits over six innings with five strikeouts and an intentional walk in his sixth major league start. The 24-year-old lefty was recalled from Triple-A Salt Lake after struggling right-hander Matt Shoemaker was pushed back two days in the rotation to get some extra work in.	Heaney was 0-3 with a 6.93 ERA in five starts last season with Miami.	"I didn't pitch well there and I didn't do the little things that would put up zeros and help win ballgames. That's something I'm trying to change here," Heaney said.	The Angels acquired Heaney in December from the Dodgers for second baseman Howie Kendrick -- the same day the Dodgers got the veteran second baseman from the Marlins in a multiplayer deal that sent Dee Gordon and Dan Haren to Miami.	"It was the first time I'd been traded -- and then to get flipped like that was a little different," Heaney said with a grin. "I'd already been traded once that day, so what's another time? I'm just glad I ended up here."	McCullers also allowed a run and four hits through six innings, striking out six and walking three in his eighth big league start. He lowered his ERA to 2.33.	McCullers had at least one runner on base in every inning. Albert Pujols drew a leadoff walk in the fourth and scored on Iannetta's bases-loaded sacrifice fly.	Houston tied it in the sixth when Jose Altuve walked with one out, stole his AL-leading 18th base and scored when rookie Carlos Correa doubled to left field over Joyce's head on a 2-0 pitch.	ON TO THE NEXT LEVEL	Astros RHP Mark Appel, the top pick in the 2013 draft, was promoted from Double-A Corpus Christi to Triple-A Fresno after going 5-1 with a 4.26 ERA.	UP NEXT	Astros: LHP Dallas Keuchel (8-3) pitches Thursday night in the opener of a four-game home series against the New York Yankees. Keuchel is 3-3 with a 2.90 ERA over his last seven starts after going 6-0 with a 1.67 ERA in his first nine.	Angels: Shoemaker is scheduled to start on six days' rest Friday night in the opener of a three-game set at home against Seattle. He was given extra time to work on fastball command. Shoemaker has a 5.20 ERA in 13 starts after setting a franchise rookie record last season with 16 wins. In five career starts against the Mariners, he is 3-1 with a 2.87 ERA.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

WASHINGTON --  Mired in a long slump at the plate, Nationals shortstop Ian Desmond found a way to help Washington get a win.	Desmond hit a sacrifice fly with the bases loaded in the bottom of the 11th inning to lift the Nationals to a 2-1 victory over the Atlanta Braves on Wednesday night for their fifth straight victory.	Desmond finished 0 for 3 and his average slipped to .220. He is now batting just .111 in his last 15 games.	"Whether I get hits or whatever, I feel like I bring something to the team every day," Desmond said. "I feel like I contribute. The box score might not say that, but I know what I bring to the team and yeah, it felt good to drive in a run there."	Bryce Harper started the winning rally with a double to right-center off Dana Eveland (0-1) and gave the crowd and the Nationals a scare when he came up limping badly at second. But after being checked out, he stayed in the game with what he said later was just a cramp in his leg.	Eveland then intentionally walked Wilson Ramos and then walked Clint Robinson to load the bases. David Aardsma came on to face Desmond, who hit his sacrifice fly to deep left that drove in Harper to end the game.	Washington manager Matt Williams gave Desmond two days off before this game to relax a bit and clear his head, and believes that shortstop will turn things around.	"I don't think it's a problem," Williams said. "He works and works and works. He's told you guys and he's told everybody that he will be OK, and he's going to work out of it."	Felipe Rivero (1-0) earned his first major league victory for Washington with an inning of scoreless relief in the 11th.	The Braves now have dropped two in a row.	Atlanta forced extra innings when it tied the score in the top of ninth against Washington closer Drew Storen. Nick Markakis and A.J. Pierzynski singled to start the inning and put runners on first and third. Storen intentionally walked Joey Terdoslavich to load the bases, and Kelly Johnson followed with a sacrifice fly to deep center that scored Markakis to tie it at 1-1.	Center fielder Denard Span then threw out Terdoslavich at second as he tried to advance on the play. That helped Storen, who retired the next batter to keep it tied after his second blown save of the season.	Both starters came away with no-decisions despite pitching well. Washington right-hander Jordan Zimmermann scattered six hits in eight scoreless innings.	Atlanta starter Shelby Miller retired the first 10 Nationals before allowing Anthony Rendon's single in the fourth -- but then retired the next seven Washington batters.	The Nationals broke that streak and took the lead in that seventh inning. Span led off with a walk and went to second when Rendon singled. Span moved to third when Yunel Escobar grounded into a force at second and scored on Harper's bloop single to give Washington a 1-0 lead.	That was the first time Washington even put someone in scoring position. Miller gave up just one run and three hits in seven innings.	"I thought the whole night both pitchers pitched really, really good baseball," Atlanta manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "I thought it was going to be one of those special nights where maybe both guys get complete games, and one ends up to be a loser, you know, 1-0."	A BAD STREAK THAT'S NOT SO BAD	Miller now has not won in his last seven starts despite pitching very well. He's given up only 16 runs in 43 1/3 innings but the Braves have scored just 19 runs in those games. Gonzalez said Miller's a pro who will keep going out there. "I don't worry about his psyche at all," the Braves' manager said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: 1B Ryan Zimmerman has custom-made orthotics, and manager Matt Williams said he took a "brisk" 15-minute walk on the treadmill yesterday. But the manager said Wednesday that there's still no official timetable for Zimmerman's return. Also, RF Bryce Harper has a right leg cramp that bothered him in the 11th inning even though he scored the winning run. He played it down after the game but Williams said the team would take a good look at it again on Thursday.	UP NEXT	Nationals: RHP Doug Fister (2-3, 4.80) will make his second start since coming off the disabled list (right forearm tightness). He allowed five runs on nine hits in 5 1/3 innings in a June 18 loss versus Tampa Bay.	Braves: RHP Matt Wisler (1-0, 1.13) makes his second major league start in this game. He held the Mets to just one run and six hits in eight innings in his first start, a 2-1 victory on June 19.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

PITTSBURGH --  Reds manager Bryan Price insists his team doesn't look forward to facing Gerrit Cole.	Judging by the way Cincinnati keeps beating the majors' leader in wins, maybe they should.	Marlon Byrd had a two-run homer during Cincinnati's four-run first inning, and the Reds won for the third time this season against Cole and the Pittsburgh Pirates, 5-2 on Wednesday night.	"I don't look and say, `Hey, we're getting Gerrit Cole this time through. I sure am happy about that," Pryce said. "There's certain starters in the league where you're going, `I hope that guy ends up pitching against us because we hit him really, really good.' Gerrit Cole is not one of them."	The Reds have won -- and scored at least three runs -- in each of the three games this season it has faced Cole (11-3). The Pirates are 11-1 when Cole starts against any other team, and he hasn't allowed more than two runs in any of his 12 starts when he hasn't faced Cincinnati.	Mike Leake (5-4), the Reds' starter each time they've beaten Cole, limited the Pirates to two runs and eight hits in seven innings to win his seventh consecutive decision against them.	Ryan Mattheus and Manny Parra combined to work a scoreless eighth, and J.J. Hoover earned his first save in more than two years with a perfect ninth -- closer Aroldis Chapman is not with the team because he's on paternity leave.	Tucker Barnhart went 3 for 4 for Cincinnati, which has won five of its past seven.	Cole had allowed just three earned runs over four starts in 27 innings in June. The Reds jumped on him in the top of the first -- all after two outs -Wednesday. RBI doubles by Todd Frazier and Jay Bruce were followed by Byrd's two-run homer, his 12th, to center.	Byrd drove in Joey Votto with a two-out single in the fifth that re-established a four-run lead for the Reds.	"What we've done when we played against (Cole) is we've done a nice job of pitching against their lineup and have won some low-scoring games with him on the mound," Price said.	Leake stranded two runners in two of his final three innings, including during the seventh. With runners at second and third and two outs and facing Starling Marte -- sixth in the NL in RBI -- Leake recorded his fifth strikeout.	He did not walk a batter.	"It was a good combination -- getting him those runs early, and him just pounding the zone," Byrd said.	HOMECOMING SAVE	Hoover, a Pittsburgh native, had four prior career saves, but none since May 16, 2013. He shrugged off the common notion that the ninth is more difficult to work than any other inning.	"You still have to go out there, get ahead of the hitters and do your job," Hoover said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: 2B Brandon Phillips was a late scratch Wednesday because of a jammed left thumb sustained in the previous night's game. Phillips had surgery on the same thumb last season. ... RHP Raisel Iglesias, on the disabled list since June 5 because of a left oblique injury, threw a bullpen session of 30-35 pitches Wednesday.	Pirates: 1B/OF Corey Hart was placed on the disabled list Wednesday. Manager Clint Hurdle said it was because of left shoulder impingement that "he's been dealing with for a while."	UP NEXT	Reds: Cincinnati remains in fourth place in the National League Central and at four games under .500. But the Reds have won six of eight games against the 40-31 Pirates and will attempt to make it three series wins against them this season with a victory Thursday.	Pirates: RHP A.J. Burnett (6-3, 2.05) allowed more hits in his most recent outing (14 in 6 2/3 innings) than he had during any of his previous 417 career starts. He will face the Reds for the third time this season, having allowed two earned runs in each of the previous two starts.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BOSTON -- The victory was overshadowed by two injuries. That's how things are going for the Boston Red Sox this season.	David Ortiz's two-run homer capped a five-run sixth inning and the Red Sox beat the Baltimore Orioles 5-1 on Wednesday night despite losing two starters to injuries.	Left fielder Hanley Ramirez left with a bruised left hand and second baseman Dustin Pedroia limped off after his tiebreaking, two-run single with right hamstring tightness.	"It's always good to win, but when you lose two guys that are in the middle of the lineup, that's a big hit," winning pitcher Clay Buchholz said. "Hopefully it's just a little thing and we can get them back out there. It's two key players, everybody knows that."	It was Boston's fifth win in eight games and snapped its six-game losing streak to the Orioles.	Baltimore lost for just the fourth time in its last 16.	Buchholz (5-6) worked seven solid innings, giving up one run on eight hits, striking out seven and walking one. Junichi Tazawa struck out the side in the eighth before Koji Uehara got the final three outs.	The attention turned to Ramirez and Pedroia after the game.	"We're still in the process of gathering all the information," manager John Farrell said. "There's advanced imaging going on for Peddy and Hanley. The injuries are what everyone saw. We don't have full information yet."	Trailing 1-0, the Red Sox scored five unearned runs off Bud Norris (2-6). Mookie Betts' RBI single tied it before Pedroia's two-run single pushed them ahead. After Pedroia rounded first, he grabbed his right leg in the hamstring area.	Ortiz followed with his homer into the first row of the center-field bleachers.	Norris was pulled in the sixth.	"It's a bit frustrating to know that that's how that inning was, but, unfortunately, there's been a couple this year that have gone that way," he said.	That was more than enough runs the way Buchholz was pitching.	"He got a lot of swings and misses, but he also got a lot of weak contact," Orioles first baseman Chris Davis said. "We know Clay. We've seen him enough. We know what he's going to do and he was good tonight."	In the fifth, Ramirez was running between first and second on a hit-and-run when Xander Bogaerts' line drive hit his hand. He left the field shaking his hand. By rule, he was out and Bogaerts was credited with a single.	The Orioles had jumped ahead 1-0 on Davis' RBI single in the sixth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: CF Adam Jones sat out for the sixth time in the last eight games with an injured right shoulder. "Improvement today," manager Buck Showalter said. "We're getting there."	Red Sox: OF Shane Victorino, on the 15-day DL with a strained left calf, started a rehab stint with Triple-A Pawtucket. "Back-to-back first couple of days, two or three at-bats," Farrell said. "We've got to get him to where he goes nine consecutive before he comes back to us. That wouldn't be on this upcoming road trip." ... Farrell also said C Blake Swihart, who sprained his left foot sliding into third over the weekend, is expected back in the lineup Thursday.	BROCK OF ALL TRADES	With the injuries, Brock Holt played three different positions in three consecutive innings. He started the game at first, moved to left in the sixth and second in the seventh.	STILL STRUGGLING	Boston 1B Mike Napoli struck out twice after fanning four times Tuesday.	STREAK SNAPPED	The Orioles' six-game winning streak against Boston was the first time in a season since they won seven in 1961.

MIAMI -- Jaime Garcia made a mistake against Giancarlo Stanton and later took a misstep on his way to scoring.	Otherwise, he and the St. Louis Cardinals rolled again.	Jason Heyward homered for the third consecutive game, Kolten Wong added a two-run shot and the Cardinals topped the Miami Marlins 6-1 on Wednesday night -- improving baseball's best record to 47-24.	"Jaime's been pitching his butt off for us," Wong said. "It's good to repay him."	Heyward hit a three-run homer, his ninth of the season, in the seventh to blow the game open. The Cardinals had just one hit in the first six innings against Miami starter Mat Latos (2-5), that hit being Wong's ninth home run in the third.	Garcia (3-3) allowed one run -- the Stanton homer, his major league-leading 27th -- in seven innings for the Cardinals, lowering his ERA to 1.69.	Garcia singled and eventually scored in the eighth but grimaced and began to limp shortly before crossing the plate. He came out of the game, but afterward Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said it was merely because of a cramp and didn't believe there was reason for concern.	"He was terrific," Matheny said. "Gave up a couple hard-hit balls, one to Stanton, but he really limited the damage."	Stanton had three hits in four at-bats -- all leading off innings, something the Marlins absolutely don't want.	"At the end of the day, we're still getting seven to 10 hits," Stanton said. "It's a matter of how important they are."	Latos threw seven innings, giving up three hits and two walks -- with all five of those runners scoring, and all earned.	St. Louis' only hit in the first six innings came in the third, Wong's homer off the facade on the upper deck in right. That gave the Cardinals a 2-1 lead, and it stayed that way into the seventh.	Jhonny Peralta led off with a single, and Mark Reynolds then took a four-pitch walk. Two pitches later, Latos left a fastball up and Heyward sent it over the wall in right for a 5-1 lead.	"The minute I make a mistake, boom, it gets hit," Latos said. "That's what they're supposed to do. Sometimes you get away with stuff like that, but it just seems to be a theme of my season."	Stanton gave the Marlins a 1-0 lead in the second, hitting his first first-pitch home run of the year in his 301st plate appearance. Garcia's 91 mph offering left in a hurry, a line drive that just kept going until it nestled in the bushes behind the center-field wall that sits 418 feet away from home plate.	But that would be one of the lone hurrahs for the Marlins.	"The goal is always to keep the ball down and keep the ball in the ballpark," Garcia said. "Made a couple mistakes ... but I was able to keep us in the game."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: 3B Matt Carpenter returned to the lineup after sitting out Tuesday with back stiffness. ... RHP Carlos Martinez had no problems with his pitching shoulder, a good sign after getting plunked with a fastball while batting Tuesday. "It looked bad at the time," Matheny said.	Marlins: RHP Henderson Alvarez (right shoulder inflammation) is long-tossing from 120 feet and is scheduled to throw off a mound Saturday, the same day as the final tuneup for ace RHP Jose Fernandez (right elbow reconstruction) before his return to the Marlins rotation next week. ... The Marlins plan to activate right-hander Jarred Cosart (vertigo) off the disabled list Thursday and send him to the bullpen. He has never relieved in the majors.	DIFFERENT STICK	Some of the NHL's top draft prospects -- this year's draft starts Friday in nearby Sunrise, Florida, home of the NHL's Panthers -- were at Marlins Park on Wednesday. Connor McDavid and Jack Eichel, who will almost certainly be picked No. 1 and No. 2 overall, threw out some of the ceremonial pregame pitches. And forward Lawson Crouse, possibly a top-five selection, homered in batting practice. "I know he can hit the crap out of a hockey puck," Marlins third-base coach Lenny Harris said.	WONG'S HOMERS	The Cardinals lost the games in which Wong hit his first two big league home runs. They're 18-3 when he homers since.	UP NEXT	RHP Lance Lynn (4-4, 3.07 ERA) goes for the Cardinals in the series finale Thursday against Miami RHP Dan Haren (6-4, 3.19). Lynn is 3-0 all time against the Marlins, and Haren hasn't gotten a single run of support in either of his past two outings.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

CHICAGO --  Justin Turner had the best season of his career last year with the Los Angeles Dodgers, and then he kept working on his swing over the winter.	All that hard work is paying off.	Turner and Adrian Gonzalez homered, and Los Angeles snapped Chicago's four-game win streak with a 5-2 victory over the Cubs on Wednesday night.	"Justin's been that guy that I've been able to put in all different spots in the order, play in a number of spots in the field, use him in different ways," manager Don Mattingly said. "So he's a valuable piece for us, that's for sure."	Gonzalez connected for a leadoff drive in the second and Turner belted a three-run shot in the third, helping Los Angeles bounce back after it scored just two runs in the first two games of the four-game series. Joc Pederson added an RBI single in the eighth for the NL West leaders, who had lost four of five overall.	Turner was let go by the Mets in December 2013, and then signed a minor league deal with Los Angeles. He set career highs with seven homers and a .340 batting average in 109 games last year, and the drive against the Cubs was his fourth in the last six games and No. 10 on the season.	"I just kept working on the mechanics of my swing over the offseason and progressing and trying to get into the best hitting position I could," Turner said, "and for whatever reason, the ball seems to be flying I think for everyone this year, not just myself."	J.P. Howell (3-1) replaced Mike Bolsinger with two out in the fifth and pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings for the win. Kenley Jansen got three outs for his 10th save in 11 chances.	Addison Russell had two hits and drove in a run for Chicago, which had won five of seven. The Cubs finished with nine hits, but left eight runners on base.	"We had opportunities," manager Joe Maddon said. "We had guys out there, the right guys hitting, but it just did not want to play."	Russell's RBI double got Chicago on the board in the fifth, and the rookie came around to score when Anthony Rizzo bounced into a double play. Bolsinger then walked Kris Bryant before Howell struck out Miguel Montero for the final out.	"The win's important," Bolsinger said. "I don't care if it's next to my name or not."	Bolsinger allowed six hits and walked two while throwing 87 pitches, 54 for strikes. The Chicago native also doubled over the head of center fielder Matt Szczur in the third and scored on Turner's two-out drive to left-center for his 10th homer.	Kyle Hendricks (2-4) lasted just five innings for Chicago. He hasn't recorded an out in the sixth in any of his last four starts.	"I'm not putting enough balls where I want them to go," Hendricks said. "I'm just not making enough good pitches, and these hitters, any mistakes you make are gonna get hit."	WHAT A RELIEF	Howell hasn't allowed an earned run in 19 2/3 innings over his last 24 appearances. Jansen has allowed just one earned run in 13 2/3 innings this season for a microscopic 0.66 ERA.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: OF Yasiel Puig was scratched because of an open callous on his left hand. Alex Guerrero replaced Puig in the fifth slot in the lineup, and Andre Ethier moved from left to right field. ... RHP Brandon League (right shoulder impingement) pitched two innings in a rehab appearance for Triple-A Oklahoma City. "We'll see how he comes out tomorrow," Mattingly said.	Cubs: CF Dexter Fowler (sprained left ankle) was out of the starting lineup for the second straight day. He grounded out as a pinch hitter in the sixth. ... LHP Tsuyoshi Wada (cramping in the back of his left arm) played catch again, and manager Joe Maddon said he is still experiencing some soreness. "We're not prepared yet to say yes or no on the next start," Maddon said. "We're going to wait probably just a little while longer to evaluate all that." ... RHP Jacob Turner (shoulder inflammation) was shut down after his right elbow "flared up," according to president of baseball operations Theo Epstein.	UP NEXT	Cubs LHP Jon Lester (4-5, 3.80 ERA) goes for his first win since May 16 in the series finale on Thursday afternoon. Lester, who signed a $155 million, six-year contract with Chicago over the winter, is 0-3 with a 3.93 ERA in his last six starts. The Dodgers counter with RHP Carlos Frias (4-5, 4.68 ERA), who is 0-3 with a 5.25 ERA in four June starts.	---	Jay Cohen can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/jcohenap	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- Kendall Graveman enjoyed watching and waiting to go to the mound, especially with the Oakland Athletics giving him a five-run lead before throwing his first pitch.	Brett Lawrie hit a grand slam, Josh Phegley homered for the second night in a row and the fast-starting A's beat Texas 8-2 on Wednesday night for their fourth straight victory.	Lawrie's third career slam, an estimated 422 feet into the Oakland bullpen in left-center, made it 5-0 in the first.	"It's just fun to watch those guys hit," Graveman said. "It helps (me) relax to be able to have confidence in throwing the fastball early in the count and try to get ahead of people."	Graveman (4-4) allowed two runs pitching into the eighth inning. It was his fourth consecutive game to pitch at least seven innings while allowing two runs or less, but had been 0-2 in the previous three.	The right-hander gave up eight runs in 3 1/3 innings against the Rangers in April and struggled in his first four starts before going back to Triple-A Nashville. He has been strong in seven starts the past month.	"It's the guy we saw in spring training, he just needed a little break after a few starts, and went down there and made use of his time," manager Bob Melvin said. "Didn't go down there and hang his head, was motivated to come back, pitched well there. Came back and hasn't missed a beat."	A's rookie center fielder Billy Burns led off each of the first two innings with doubles, and scored both times on hits by Stephen Vogt. Burns also singled in the third and has a 14-game hitting streak, with hits in 26 of his last 27 games.	Phegley's two-run homer in the second to make it 8-0.	Carlos Corporan had a two-run double for the Rangers, who have lost four in a row for the first time since April 27-May 1.	Texas had won its last six games started by Rodriguez, who had allowed three runs or less in each of those games. The lefty gave up 11 hits and eight runs while throwing 94 pitches in four innings against Oakland.	"All my pitches were in trouble. I feel good, but today I felt like my ball had no speed. I tried to throw hard, but something, I don't know," Rodriguez said. "I just had bad location on my pitches. I can't do anything with this one so I ask God to help me do well next outing and try to win, and win the game."	UPON FURTHER REVIEW	The Rangers challenged the play ending the fifth inning, when Rougned Odor was called out on a force play at second base. After a replay review of more than 2 1-2 minutes, the call stood. Had Odor been safe, Texas would have had the based loaded for Prince Fielder.	"I felt like we had an opportunity right up until the replay," Rangers manager Jeff Banister said.	Graveman and Melvin called it a huge play.	"One went our way," Melvin said. "Based on what we've seen on replay, (it) should have gone our way."	BRUISED UMPIRE	Second base umpire Dale Scott sustained a bruised left thigh and was out of the game for 2 1-2 innings after being struck by Lawrie's liner with two outs in the fourth inning.	"I was surprised he came back. That was a pretty good shot," Melvin said. "I'm guessing that one's going to leave a mark."	The crew chief walked gingerly off the field after briefly conferring with a Rangers trainer. Scott grimaced in pain, but never left his feet. The umpires worked as a three-man crew until Scott returned for the start of the seventh inning.	Scott won't work Thursday's game and will be replaced.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: Vogt returned to the lineup, at first base instead of catching for his first game since a cortisone injection in his left elbow Sunday. It was his 10th start at first, but Melvin expects Vogt to make his 48th start at catcher in the series finale Thursday.	Rangers: LHP Matt Harrison pitched six innings for Double-A Frisco, his fifth rehab start in his recovery from spinal fusion surgery last year. ... Slugger Josh Hamilton (strained left hamstring) played in that same game, going 1-for-3 with a double, a walk and a hard liner for an out. Hamilton will join Triple-A Round Rock on Thursday.	UP NEXT	Athletics: Sonny Gray (8-3), whose 1.95 ERA is best in the AL, has allowed only one run over 31 1/3 innings in his four previous starts at Texas. He threw two shutouts there last year.	Rangers: The Rangers try to avoid a series sweep and their first five-game losing streak this season. Scheduled starter Colby Lewis is 3-0 with a 2.79 ERA his last four starts.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MILWAUKEE --  Jimmy Nelson avoided his usual first-inning problems and came out a winner.	Nelson allowed two hits in eight strong innings, Scooter Gennett hit a home run and the Milwaukee Brewers extended the New York Mets' losing streak to a season-high seven games with a 4-1 victory Wednesday night.	"The first innings have been a little uneven for him," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. "He was just good all night tonight."	Nelson (4-8) allowed one run, Curtis Granderson's 11th home run, and two hits. He struck out five and walked one sending the Mets to their longest skid since April 2011. Johnny Monell singled leading off the third for the first hit in the game off the Brewers' big right-hander.	It was a nice victory for Nelson, especially after struggling his two previous starts. He allowed seven runs and 10 hits over five innings in a 7-2 home defeat to Washington on June 13, then yielded three runs and a career-worst 11 hits over five in Friday's 3-2 loss at Kansas City.	Counsell thought the win might be a confidence booster for the 25-year-old Nelson.	"He's been a little uneven this year, but he's still a young pitcher," Counsell said. "It was a great night for him to build on and to know what's in there."	After Granderson's home run, his second in as many games, Nelson retired 15 of his last 16 batters. The only blemish was a two-out walk to Granderson.	"When I walked Granderson, I was coming out of it a little bit early," Nelson said of his delivery. "I was able to make the adjustment as opposed to letting that inning go as it has in the past."	The Mets are in an offensive funk during their winless eight-game road trip. They came in batting .168 with four home runs and eight runs scored and did little to turn it around against Nelson who beat them for the first time in three starts.	"We didn't mount anything today, outside the home run and a double late," Mets manager Terry Collins said after a brief closed-door meeting with the team after the game. "That's about it."	The Brewers scratched out four runs and 10 hits in six innings off Mets starter Bartolo Colon (9-6) as New York (36-37) slipped below .500 for the first time since a 2/3 record on April 11.	Gennett hit a solo home run off Colon in the sixth, and Ryan Braun, Adam Lind and Carlos Gomez each had run-scoring hits.	Francisco Rodriguez pitched the ninth for his 15th save in as many chances. He stranded Ruben Tejada at second on with a two-out double when he struck out Lucas Duda on a pitch that bounced in the dirt before catcher Jonathan Lucroy grabbed it and threw to first for the final out.	With the victory, Milwaukee spoiled Colon's attempt to become the second 10-game winner in the NL, and third in the majors. Pittsburgh's Gerrit Cole leads with 11 victories and Seattle's Felix Hernandez has 10.	Injuries continue to plague the Mets. Catcher Travis d'Arnaud (left elbow) went on the disabled list for the second time this season Tuesday. He joins David Wright, out since mid-April, first with a hamstring injury and now lumbar spinal stenosis, and Daniel Murphy (left quad strain) on the DL. Earlier, d'Arnaud spent nearly two months on the DL with a broken right pinkie.	Collins said that there's only one thing the Mets can do.	"You just got to grind it out," he said. "Continue to grind out at-bats."	Asked if the front office has done enough, Collins didn't hesitate.	"I don't blame anybody," he said. "I've never done that. I never will. These are the guys that are here. They're major league players. We've got to play better."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: Collins gave OF Michael Cuddyer and INF Dilson Herrera the night off to regroup. Cuddyer's error in the seventh allowed the decisive run to score in Tuesday night's 3-2 loss to Milwaukee. He is in a 3-for-21 slump, while Herrera is 1 for 17. Collins started catcher Johnny Monell for Kevin Plawecki. Monell was recalled from Triple-A Las Vegas Tuesday when d'Arnaud (left elbow) went on the day DL. Plawecki will start on Thursday. ... 2B Murphy, on the 15-day DL since June 5 with a left quad strain, went 1-1 with a walk in a rehab assignment for the rookie-level Gulf Coast Mets on Wednesday.	Brewers: LF Khris Davis, on the 15-day DL since May 31 with a torn right meniscus, hit during batting practice. He has been running the bases and throwing. "All signs are very positive," Counsell said. No date has been announced for Davis's return.	UP NEXT	Mets: RHP Jacob deGrom (7-5) pitched well in his previous start, but still took the loss. He allowed two runs on four hits in 7 1/3 innings June 19 as the Atlanta Braves beat him 2-1.	Brewers: RHP Taylor Jungmann (2-1) makes his fourth career start and first ever against the Mets. He was recalled from Triple-A Colorado Springs on June 9.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DENVER --  Jarrod Saltalamacchia kept the Arizona Diamondbacks' ninth inning rally going by drawing a bases-loaded walk.	Saltalamacchia drove home the tying run and pinch-hitter Aaron Hill hit a go-ahead sacrifice fly to cap a three-run rally as the Arizona Diamondbacks came back to beat the Colorado Rockies 8-7 Wednesday night in a game that began with a 46 minute rain delay.	Down 7-5 heading into the ninth, Arizona pulled within a run on Yasmany Tomas' RBI single, his career-high fourth hit of the game.	After a bloop single by Jake Lamb loaded the bases, closer John Axford (1-1) fanned Chris Owings but then in a grueling 10-pitch confrontation walked Saltalamacchia, forcing home the tying run and blowing a save for the first time in 13 chances this season.	"It was one of those at-bats where you definitely aren't trying to do too much," Saltalamacchia said. "You got bases loaded, one out so you just want to put the ball in play. But you got a guy who throws 96 mph, so you got to see pitches. Thankfully, I was able to foul some good pitches off and work it to where he threw balls."	Axford tipped his cap to Saltalamacchia for his determined at bat.	"A big battle with Saltalamacchia there," Axford said. "I mean, he battled off a lot of pitches. That was a hardfought battle. I had to take a few extra deep breaths and try to gather myself. That was mentally tough, and physically tough."	Hill, batting for reliever Daniel Hudson (2-2), then drove a fly ball to deep center, scoring Tomas from third.	Brad Ziegler pitched a perfect ninth for his 11th save.	Paul Goldschmidt's two-run homer in the fifth off starter David Hale gave Arizona a 5-3 lead. It was his 20th home run of the season, giving him one more homer than he had all of last year.	But Colorado came right back in its half of the fifth, regaining the lead with a four-run burst. The go-ahead run crossed the plate after Hundley, who homered in the second, drew a bases-loaded walk off reliever Randall Delgado.	Trailing 3-0, Arizona evened the score in the fourth inning, pulling to within a run on successive doubles off Hale by Yasmany Tomas, Jake Lamb and Chris Owings. Nick Ahmed added an RBI single.	The Rockies jumped on Allen Webster for two unearned runs in the first, with Webster's errant pickoff throw to first and shortstop Ahmed's errant throw home opening the door to the runs.	Nick Hundley drove a 1-1 offering from Webster over the center field wall in the second.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: RHP Archie Bradley, one of the club's top prospects who has been battling right shoulder tendinitis, was scheduled to make his first rehab start Tuesday night for Triple-A Reno at Tacoma. ... An MRI showed no problems with Jeremy Hellickson's lower back/left hip area and a subsequent bullpen session went well, and team officials expect he'll make his next scheduled start on Saturday against San Diego. Last Sunday against the Padres, Hellickson was hit in the left hip area by a pitch and later tweaked his lower back swinging the bat.	Rockies: OF Carlos Gonzalez took batting practice swings in a cage but was held out of the starting lineup for a second consecutive game because of a left hand strain. He entered the game as a defensive replacement in right field in the eighth inning.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: RHP Rubby De La Rosa (6-3) will be making his fifth career appearance and third start against the Rockies in the series finale. He's 2-0 with a 2.57 ERA against Colorado.	Rockies: LHP Jorge De La Rosa will face Arizona for the first time this season after going 0-3 with a 5.40 ERA in four starts against the Diamondbacks a year ago.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SEATTLE --  Kansas City is getting used to this. Big hits, big innings and yet another victory, this time 8-2 over the Seattle Mariners on Wednesday night.	Mike Moustakas hit a two-run home run and Omar Infante had a three-run double to highlight the Royals' seven-run fourth inning. Kansas City pounded out 13 hits, the 17th time this season they've had that many or more.	"This is great for a team that's built off pitching and defense," said first baseman Eric Hosmer. "For our offense to put up those types of numbers, it's great for us. It makes us a complete team.	"As an offense, we grew a lot last year, through the playoffs and this year. We're getting good at-bats. We're doing a good job and not trying to do too much."	The defending American League champions -- with seven starters leading the All-Star balloting -- the Royals were subdued for three innings by Mariners starter Roenis Elias (4-5).	Then Alcides Escobar opened the fourth with a single to right. Moustakas followed with his shot just over the right-field wall, his seventh, on a 3-2 fastball.	"Mous got it going for us," Hosmer said. "When we're struggling like that, he usually takes a big swing, double or home run, to let us all exhale a little bit. We put together some good at-bats after that."	The Royals would score five more, all with two outs. Infante unloaded the bases with his double to left then Jarrod Dyson and Alcides Escobar each followed with left-field RBI doubles.	Escobar had three hits -- two in the fourth -- and scored twice. Moustakas had three hits and two RBI. Infante also had three hits to go along with his three RBI.	"I'm not sure what happened," Elias said through an interpreter. "I felt good. It was just a bad day for me."	Mariners manager Lloyd McClendon was equally perplexed.	"We are just trying to figure that out," he said. "He was throwing a whale of a ballgame and he just fell apart in the fourth inning and couldn't get it back together."	Danny Duffy, in his first start for Kansas City since a rehab stint, was one out away from being the pitcher of record but couldn't close the fifth. He gave up a sacrifice fly to newly promoted Franklin Gutierrez and another run scored on an error.	"I want to really try to get him through that game, give him the win," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "But I wasn't going to jeopardize anything. He just didn't have much left and it affected his command."	Ryan Madson (1-1) worked 1-plus inning of hitless relief for the win, his first since 2011.	"I'd rather let Duffy have it," Madson said. "He obviously earned it more than I did. He threw well, set the tone and made it easy for us to come in there and just pitch."	This was the 42nd game in 44 days for the Mariners. They get their first day off Thursday since June 8.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: RHP Hisashi Iwakuma (strained lat) will have his second rehab start Thursday for Triple-A Tacoma. He is expected to throw between 70 and 75 pitches. He likely will have one more before the club considers his next step. LHP James Paxton (strained middle finger) will play catch Thursday. "That's a step in the right direction," manager Lloyd McClendon said.	Royals: CF Lorenzo Cain slightly strained his hamstring running down a Dustin Ackley flyball in the seventh inning Tuesday. As a precaution, manager Ned Yost held him out to give him two full days (off day Thursday) to rest it.	UP NEXT (Friday)	Mariners: RHP Taijuan Walker (5-6, 4.94) doesn't have a winning record but that's not relative the way he's trending. Over his last five starts, Walker is 4-1 with a 2.04 ERA, has won three straight and has gone eight innings in back-to-back starts. Something has clicked for the second-year right-hander.	Angels: RHP Matt Shoemaker (4-5, 5.20) has not found what he had last season when he went 16-4 with a 3.04 ERA. He has split with Seattle this year, winning 5-3 in his first season start April 8. He then lost 3-2 on May 4. In that game, he worked a season-high 7 1/3 innings with a season-high 10 strikeouts but yielded three home runs.	BIG THREE OF SORTS	Walker, Elias (before his start Wednesday) and rookie Mike Montgomery have stepped up since Mariners veteran starters Iwakuma and James Paxton landed on the DL. Over each of their previous three starts (9), they were a combined 7-1 record with a 4.71 ERA, 14 walks and 43 strikeouts. "It's a big lift when you think Iwakuma and Paxton are out X amount of time," McClendon said. "If I had hair I'd be pulling it out. These guys have come in and thrown some quality, quality innings and really settled our rotation quite nicely."	LEFT-SIDE ISSUES	The Royals have not built the third best record in the American League by facing left-handers. They were 10-13 before facing Elias and had lost seven straight.	They chased Elias in the fourth inning and went on to their first win against a left-handed starter since May 17.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Bruce Bochy's plans to get some more offense into the Giants' lineup likely means less time behind the plate for Buster Posey.	San Francisco's' All-Star catcher doesn't mind the break.	With Andrew Susac starting at catcher and batting seventh, Posey moved to first base and hit his second grand slam in five games to help San Francisco beat the San Diego Padres 6-0 on Wednesday night.	Susac added two hits and scored twice as the Giants won at home for just the second time in their last 12 games at AT&T Park.	"He hasn't talked to me, but I have the understanding, we have the understanding, that it's about winning games," Posey said. "Bochy's been really good at his job for a long time now and we all have trust in the decisions he makes. Anybody who's seen this team for a while knows we're willing to change the roles if it does help the team win."	Posey hit his 11th home run of the season on a 2-2 pitch from San Diego starter Ian Kennedy (4-6) with two outs in the third inning. That came two batters after Joe Panik's sacrifice fly drove in Susac.	It's Posey's fourth career grand slam. He also hit one against the Los Angeles Dodgers on June 19.	"Especially two strikes there, I'm just trying to stay short and hit a line drive somewhere," Posey said. "Fortunately, it turned into a little more."	Ryan Vogelsong pitched six scoreless innings for his second straight win. Vogelsong (6-5) gave up five hits, struck out four and walked two while helping San Francisco to its majors-leading 12th shutout.	San Diego's Matt Kemp went 0 for 4 with one strikeout while batting leadoff for the first time since 2010.	"You can't give them five outs," said Padres interim manager Pat Murphy, whose club gave up five unearned runs in the loss. "I felt like we gave them the extra outs. If we played defense better, we wouldn't be talking about it."	Javier Lopez and George Kontos retired three batters each, while Jean Machi pitched the ninth for the Giants to complete the five-hitter.	Kennedy retired the first six hitters before Susac reached on an error by third baseman Will Middlebrooks. Gregor Blanco singled, and after both runners were sacrificed over, Angel Pagan walked to load the bases.	Panik followed with a sacrifice fly before Posey's home run.	Susac tripled and scored in the fourth to make it 6-0.	Vogelsong pitched out of a jam in the fourth after walking the leadoff batter and giving up a double to Justin Upton. Vogelsong got Derek Norris to strike out looking, fielded Will Venable's comebacker to catch Yonder Alonso in a rundown between third and home, then got Middlebrooks to ground out.	"He did a terrific job of pitching out of that," Bochy said. "He had to do that a couple times. He kept his poise and just made some great pitches."	Kennedy allowed six runs -- one earned -- and five hits in six innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: RHP Dale Thayer was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a strained right shoulder. RHP Nick Vincent was optioned to Triple-A El Paso. RHP Kevin Quackenbush and RHP Marcos Mateo were called up from El Paso. Both pitched in the game. ... RHP Brandon Morrow (shoulder) was transferred to the 60-day disabled list.	Giants: Leadoff hitter Nori Aoki was placed on the 15-disbled list with a small fracture in his right leg. The move is retroactive to June 21. Travis Ishikawa was called up from Triple-A Sacramento to take Aoki's roster spot. Ishikawa hit a three-run home run in the bottom of the ninth inning to win Game 5 of the NLCS for San Francisco last season. ... OF Hunter Pence (left wrist) had his brace removed.	UP NEXT	Padres: RHP James Shields (7-1) will try to bounce back after suffering his first loss in his start against Arizona on June 19. Shields has had at least five strikeouts in all but one of his 15 starts this season.	Giants: RHP Chris Heston (7-5) pitches the finale trying to win for the first time in three games against the Padres. He has an 8.00 ERA in two previous starts against San Diego.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DETROIT --  Up a run in the 10th, Chicago White Sox manager Robin Ventura didn't think twice about walking Miguel Cabrera to load the bases.	"It's always risky because you put the winning run at second, but you don't tug on Superman's cape too often," Ventura said of the two-time AL MVP. "We're going to take our chances with the next guy."	David Robertson struck out Josh Wilson to end the game, finishing an 8-7 victory over the Detroit Tigers.	With the score 5-all, Joba Chamberlain (0-2) walked Melky Cabrera with one out in the 10th, hit Avisail Garcia with a pitch and then allowed pinch-hitter J.B. Shuck's two-out infield single to shortstop. Sanchez tripled past Miguel Cabrera at first and all the way to the right-field wall on a 1-2 pitch, putting Chicago ahead 8-5.	Robertson gave up a two-run single to Bryan Holaday with one out in the bottom half, then retired Ian Kinsler on a flyout. Wityh runners at first and second, Ventura decided to give Miguel Cabrera the free pass	"I want to win the game, so I think I take the bat away from the best hitter in the game," Robertson said.	Wilson took a ball, then swung and missed at three straight pitches, giving Robertson his 15th save in 19 chances.	"I've seen enough of Miggy to realize he's the best hitter in the game," Ventura said. "He's going to get me at some point, but he didn't get me today."	Zach Duke (3-2) pitched a scoreless inning for the win, and Adam Eaton homered for Chicago.	Kinsler and J.D. Martinez hit two-run homers for Detroit. Martinez has five home runs and 10 RBI in his last four games.	Ventura let Eaton know he was displeased after Eaton failed to run out an at-bat in Wednesday's loss to Minnesota. Eaton then sent Alfredo Simon's second pitch of Thursday's game into the right-field stands for his second career leadoff homer.	Sanchez began the day hitting .159 with six RBI in 37 games but then got his first big league triple and three-RBI game.	"He did his job. I didn't do mine," Chamberlain said. "The greatest thing about this is I get a chance to go out there tomorrow and do it again."	White Sox rookie Carlos Rodon allowed four run, eight hits and three walks in five innings, and struck out seven.	SHARP DEBUT	Tigers reliever Bruce Rondon struck out two batters in an eight-pitch seventh, his first major league appearance since Sept. 24, 2013. The right-hander had Tommy John surgery in March 2014 and made 13 appearances during a minor league injury rehabilitation assignment that started May 21.	"He did a nice job," manager Brad Ausmus said. "He got the two big outs."	Rondon was activated from the 15-day disabled list. To clear a roster spot, Detroit optioned right-hander Buck Farmer to Triple-A Toledo.	BOUNCING BACK	Ventura benched shortstop Alexei Ramirez on Thursday after a 9-for-57 (.158) slump over 15 games. Ramirez pinch hit in the eighth and had an RBI double off Blaine Hardy. He was stranded when Tyler Flowers flied out. Joquin Soria struck him out in the 10th.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: Catcher Alex Avila, on the disabled list since May 8 with a loose body in his left knee, is to begin a rehab assignment with Toledo on Friday. Manager Brad Ausmus said Avila will alternate catching the first six days with the Mudhens. He will be evaluated after next Friday's game.	UP NEXT	Detroit RHP Anibal Sanchez (6-7) looks for his fourth straight win against Chicago lefty Jose Quintana (3-7).	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

BOSTON -- Baltimore right-hander Miguel Gonzalez had a chance to watch his teammates get on winning spurt.	Now he's glad to be a part of it.	Matt Wieters hit a two-run homer during a six-run fourth inning that carried the Orioles over the Boston Red Sox 8-6 Thursday, earning Gonzalez a victory in his first start off the disabled list.	"It was fun to watch," Gonzalez said. "It's good to be back and healthy. My teammates gave me a chance to win a ballgame."	Gonzalez (6-4), activated before the game following a stint on the DL with a strained right groin, allowed four runs and eight hits in five-plus innings, helping the Orioles to their 13th win in 17 games.	"He kept us engaged," Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said. "It's a good start for him. The important thing is he's healthy."	J.J. Hardy added a two-run double against rookie left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez, who lasted just 3 2/3 innings.	Steve Pearce had three hits for Baltimore, which took two of three in the series and bounced back after Wednesday's loss to beat Boston for the seventh time in eight games.	"We're getting closer little by little. We have our moments."	Alejandro De Aza hit a three-run homer for the Red Sox.	Zach Britton gave up a leadoff single to Jackie Bradley Jr. in the ninth, then got three straight outs for his 21st save in 22 chances.	Rodriguez (3-2) yielded six runs and seven hits after allowing one run or none in four of his first five major league starts.	Baltimore scored the tying run in the fourth when Rodriguez's throwing error on Nolan Reimold's infield hit allowed Chris Parmelee to come home.	Wieters homered in Boston's bullpen on a 2-0 pitch for a 3-1 lead, starting a streak of five straight hits for the Orioles that included Hardy's double off the Green Monster. No. 9 hitter Ryan Flaherty chased Rodriguez with a sacrifice fly.	Rodriguez shutout his former organization over six innings with seven strikeouts in a victory on June 9. He was traded to the Red Sox at last season's non-waiver deadline for reliever Andrew Miller.	"I just knew we were going to have to put up a big inning to get a win against him," Wieters said.	Rodriguez retired the first nine batters easily, striking out five, before the fourth.	"He's cruising along. He retires the first 10 of the game. He was dominant," Boston manager John Farrell said. "And then he gets in the stretch, they make a little bit of an adjustment, and he's not commanding the baseball as he was when he got into the stretch."	De Aza's fourth-inning homer hooked around the Pesky Pole.	Manny Machado hit a run-scoring single in the sixth off Jonathan Aro, who made his major league debut, and Chris Davis made it 8-4 with an RBI double in the seventh.	NICE GLOVE	Parmelee made a couple of stellar plays at first after getting into a collision with right fielder Delmon Young earlier in the game. He made a leaping grab of Pablo Sandoval's line drive and a diving stab of Blake Swihart's ground ball.	WHAT A THROW	Bradley fired a strike to the plate from medium right, cutting down David Lough trying to score in the ninth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: CF Adam Jones missed his seventh game in Baltimore's last nine because of an injured right shoulder.	Red Sox: 2B Dustin Pedroia was placed on the 15-day DL after straining his right hamstring Wednesday. ... LF Hanley Ramirez missed the game after bruising his left hand Wednesday. "He's swollen and got some soreness," Farrell said.	FINALLY	Bradley was recalled from Pawtucket. His infield hit in the fourth stopped an 0-for-30 slide dating to Sept. 14.	UP NEXT:	Orioles: LHP Wei-Yin Chen (3-4) is slated to rejoin the rotation on Friday when the Orioles open a three-game series against Cleveland and RHP Corey Kluber (3-9).	Red Sox: RHP Rick Porcello (4-8, 5.61 ERA), who has lost six straight starts since winning at Seattle on May 16, is scheduled to start Friday against the Rays and RHP Alex Colome (3-3).	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- Sonny Gray won his fifth consecutive start at Texas, Josh Reddick drove in three runs and the Oakland Athletics completed a three-game series sweep with a 6-3 victory Thursday.	Reddick had a two-run single with two outs in the seventh immediately after Ben Zobrist drew a bases-loaded walk off Sam Freeman to break a 3-3 tie. Reddick's sac fly an inning earlier had tied the game.	Gray (9-3) struck out seven and walked one over six innings, improving to 5-0 with a 0.96 ERA in his five road starts against the Rangers. The right-hander had allowed only one run in 31 1/3 innings the previous four starts, including two shutouts last season.	Oakland has won nine of its past 11 games, and is headed home for a weekend series against the Royals.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

MILWAUKEE -- Jacob deGrom sent the New York Mets home with a rare road win.	DeGrom gave up four hits in eight innings and the Mets beat the Milwaukee Brewers 2-0 Thursday to stop a seven-game losing streak, their longest since April 2011.	"He's got tremendous stuff. He knows how to use it. He's legit," Mets manager Terry Collins said. "He's not going through any sophomore slump. He's making the adjustments he has to make and making pitches. Outstanding game."	DeGrom (8-5) struck out seven and walked none in the eighth straight start in which he has given up two earned runs or fewer.	"I try not to be too confident out there. I just try to get ahead with strike one and go from there," deGrom said. "You get too cocky and you can get put back into place real quick."	Wilmer Flores hit a go-ahead double in the sixth for the Mets (37-37), who avoided falling two games below .500 for the first time this year. New York completed a 1-7 trip during which it was outscored 31-11 and hit .177.	Jeurys Familia pitched a perfect ninth for his 20th save in 22 chances, and New York won for just the fourth time in its last 22 road games. The Mets are 26-11 at Citi Field but 11-26 away from home.	Collins was ejected in the fourth after Darrell Ceciliani was caught stealing at second. Collins ran onto the field and briefly argued with umpire Larry Vanover.	"I thought he was safe," Collins said. "I went out to Larry and said I know I don't have any challenges left, but for heaven's sake, from my angle it wasn't even close at all."	Milwaukee's Taylor Jungmann made his fourth big league start and held the Mets to four hits in five innings.	Center fielder Gerardo Parra threw out Michael Cuddyer at the plate when he tried to score from second base in the second inning on Kevin Plawecki's single to center, a call that stood after a video review that took more than four minutes.	Flores put the Mets ahead after Cuddyer's two-out single off Michael Blazek (4-2).	New York loaded the bases with one out in the seventh but managed only one run on an infield single by Lucas Duda that deflected off the foot of reliever Will Smith.	After Milwaukee's Adam Lind singled with two outs in the seventh, Shane Peterson hit what initially was ruled a ground-rule double down the left-field line. Umpires called for a review and ruled the ball foul and Peterson singled. DeGrom retired Jean Segura on a popout.	MATZ TIME	New York could be bringing up heralded pitching prospect Steven Matz, a 24-year-old left-hander who is 7-4 with a 2.19 ERA at Triple-A Las Vegas with 94 strikeouts in 90 1/3 innings this season. "We'll talk about the rotation tomorrow," Collins said. When pressed as to whether he'd be inserting a new pitcher into the rotation, Collins said: "It's very possible."	GIMME SHELTER	A rain shower that began in the bottom of the second inning left some fans scrambling for cover. The stadium's retractable roof closed before the completion of the top of the third inning.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: 2B Dilson Herrera returned to the starting lineup after being given Wednesday night off. The rookie, who returned from a broken finger on June 10, had been hitless in 16 straight at-bats before singling in the seventh.	Brewers: OF Carlos Gomez and 3B Aramis Ramirez didn't start so that they could "rest their legs," Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said. Gomez entered the game as a defensive replacement in the eighth.	UP NEXT	Mets: Noah Syndergaard (2-4) starts Friday's homestand opener against Cincinnati. He is 0-2 with a 6.75 ERA in his last four starts.	Brewers: Kyle Lohse (3-9) starts Friday's series opener at home against Minnesota. Lohse is 0-5 with a 7.59 ERA in his last six starts and 0-1 with a 9.28 ERA in two career starts against the Twins.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO --  Jon Lester's first season with the Chicago Cubs is not going as planned.	Lester's winless streak stretched to seven starts when he lasted four innings in his shortest outing in more than three years, and the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Chicago Cubs 4-0 Thursday for a four-game split.	Signed to a $155 million, six-year contract, Lester (4-6) allowed four runs, four hits and four walks, while striking out five. He is 0-4 with a 4.43 ERA since beating Pittsburgh on May 16.	"It just comes down to the things I keep preaching and harping on, is fastball location and executing pitches," Lester said. "That's what it comes down to, and I'm not doing it consistently enough right now to help this team."	Lester had not gotten that few outs in a start since lasting two-plus innings for Boston in an 18-3 loss to Texas on April 17, 2012.	When Lester was in the AL with Boston or Oakland, he was allowed to go longer in games on occasions when he gave up early runs. But with no designated hitter in the NL, the Cubs pinch hit for Lester in the fourth after he threw consecutive scoreless innings.	"There's been times where in my career I've given up four in the first and gotten into the eighth," Lester said. "That just doesn't happen here."	His frustration showed in the second inning after he walked A.J. Ellis. Lester said he turned around with his head down and yelled something to himself, but apparently plate umpire Andy Fletcher thought it was aimed at him, Fletcher had to be blocked from getting closer to the pitcher by catcher David Ross. Chicago manager Joe Maddon then came out to argue with Fletcher but was not ejected.	"Rossie did a great job of going out there and got between him, and I was able to talk to Andy and I think it settled down after that," Maddon said.	Carlos Frias combined with four relievers on an eight-hitter. Jimmy Rollins had two hits, an RBI and run scored for the NL West-leading Dodgers, who won the final two games of the series.	Left fielder Alex Guerrero threw out Chris Coghlan at home plate in the fourth inning when Coghlan tried to score from second on Miguel Montero's two-out single.	"Carlos put up zeroes through five and the bullpen did a nice job piecing it together for us," Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said.	Howie Kendrick hit a two-run double in the first, and Enrique Hernandez tripled in a run in the second.	Frias (5-5) allowed seven hits in five innings, struck out five and walked three. He had been 0-3 with a 5.25 ERA in 24 innings since winning at St. Louis on May 30. Joel Peralta, J.P. Howell, Yimi Garcia and Kenley Jansen pitched an inning each.	Frias was sick earlier this week and said he "didn't eat for like a day and a half" and got dehydrated.	"I couldn't go deep in the game, but I did my best," Frias said.	Lester, meanwhile, wasn't at his best again.	"I feel good going into starts," he said. "It's not like I'm searching for things."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: OF Yasiel Puig didn't start for the second straight game because of an open callous on his left hand.	Cubs: LHP Tsuyoshi Wada (left shoulder) hasn't been ruled out of making a start Saturday against St. Louis, and the Cubs will announce their starter for that game Friday. ... Maddon said OF Jorge Soler (left ankle) is "relatively close" to being able to go on a rehab assignment.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: LHP Brett Anderson (3-4) faces Marlins LHP Justin Nicolino (1-0) on Friday in Miami.	Cubs: RHP Jake Arrieta (7-5) pitches against the Cardinals and RHP John Lackey (6-4) on Friday in St. Louis. Arrieta is 3-1 with a 1.51 ERA in seven starts against St. Louis.	LIMITED DAY	Chicago did not start Starlin Castro and played the last seven innings without Kris Bryant. The rookie struck out in the first, then left after the second inning with what the team called flu-like symptoms. Castro was a late scratch from the starting lineup because he was anticipating the birth of his second child, which was a daughter named Scarlett. He entered in the sixth as part of a double switch.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

DENVER --  On a day when he got a break from his job as the Colorado Rockies starting shortstop, Troy Tulowitzki stepped into a starring role of a different sort.	Tulowitzki started a five-run eighth inning with his first career pinch-hit home run, and the Rockies rallied to beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 6-4 Thursday.	"I have a lot of respect for guys who have to make a living pinch-hitting. It's difficult," Tulowitzki said. "I was just trying to put together a good at-bat."	It was good enough to help Colorado overcome the loss of its starter, Jorge De La Rosa, because of a small cut on the middle finger of his left (pitching) hand.	"The cut opened up pretty good," Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. "We felt if we let him go any longer, maybe he's really going to tear that thing."	The team said De La Rosa's status was day to day.	The Diamondbacks scored two runs in the ninth and had the tying run at the plate when John Axford struck out Yasmany Tomas for the final out, notching his 13th save in 14 chances.	Axford had blown a save for the first time this season in an 8-7 loss to the Diamondbacks on Wednesday.	"This feels good. Overall, it feels good because it was a great team win," Axford said. "Having a short memory is important and getting back out there is important, so if the game was on the line again, I wanted to be back out there if they needed me."	Arizona's Rubby De La Rosa left after seven effective innings with the Diamondbacks in front 2-1. Reliever Daniel Hudson opened the eighth against Tulowitzki, Colorado's slugging shortstop who was brought in to bat for Justin Miller (1-0).	The Diamondbacks have failed to reach .500 in their past 11 tries. They were last .500 on April 24.	Tulowitzki drove a 1-0 pitch from Hudson (2-3) beyond the center field wall into the Rockies' bullpen for his eighth home run of the season. The Rockies sent 11 batters to the plate, including five who reached on walks, two intentionally.	"I just trying to get it down," Hudson said of his pitch to Tulowitzki. "I just left it up a little bit up. He put a pretty good swing on it. Then I walked the next guy and it snowballed which is the way things happen here. It's tough sometimes to stop it."	Colorado went in front on Ben Paulsen's run-scoring groundout, added an RBI single from Wilin Rosario and added two more runs that scored on third baseman Aaron Hill's fielding error.	"We had the game where we wanted to have it," Arizona manager Chip Hale said. "We felt comfortable there. You know, Tulowitzki came off the bench and hits a home run. It's just very typical playing in this ballpark. The game is never over."	Jorge De La Rosa had matched his Diamondbacks counterpart through five scoreless innings before walking the first two batters in the sixth. He stepped off the mound and began rubbing the finger and trainers came out to the mound to check on him. De La Rosa has been bothered by the cut for his past few starts.	His grip affected by the injury, De La Rosa was lifted in favor of reliever Christian Bergman, who allowed an RBI single by Welington Castillo.	The Rockies had another scary moment when catcher Michael McKenry and third baseman Nolan Arenado collided in foul territory as they raced to catch Chris Owings' popup. McKenry hung on to make the catch while Arenado seemed to take the worst of the collision.	Arenado shook it off, though, and subsequently homered on the first pitch he saw from Rubby De La Rosa to even the score at 1-1 in the bottom of the sixth.	The Diamondbacks regained the lead in the seventh. With two outs, Nick Ahmed doubled down the third base line off Bergman and A.J. Pollock followed with a run-scoring double to left.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: RHP Archie Bradley, one of the team's top prospects, has been sent to Phoenix to have his right shoulder examined. Bradley, who has been dealing with tendinitis in his pitching shoulder, made his first rehab appearance for Triple-A Reno on Wednesday. "He just didn't feel that great after the outing so we sent him back to Phoenix to be evaluated," Diamondbacks manager Chip Hale said.	Rockies: OF Carlos Gonzalez was held out of the starting lineup for a third consecutive game because of a strained left hand. He remains day to day. ... RHP Rafael Betancourt, on the 15-day disabled list since June 8 because of vertigo symptoms, was expected to be reinstated in the next two or three days, while the team is at San Francisco, according to manager Walt Weiss.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: LHP Robbie Ray (2-2), whose 1.78 ERA ranks fourth among major league starters, is set to start Friday's series opener at San Diego on Friday.	Rockies: Head out on a 10-game road trip, longest of the season. It begins with a weeklong stay in the San Francisco Bay area for a series against the Giants followed by an interleague matchup with the Oakland Athletics. RHP Chad Bettis (3-2) will start Friday's series opener against the Giants.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Brandon Belt found another gear on the bases, and compared himself to a long-legged jungle animal.	The speedy Giants hit four triples in a game for the first time in 55 years, including a pair by Belt in a 13-8 win over the San Diego Padres on Thursday.	"When I can sniff a triple, I'm going to turn it on," Belt said. "I will do whatever I have to do, use my giraffe strides, to get to third base."	Brandon Crawford and Matt Duffy also tripled for San Francisco, which had not tripled four times in a game since Sept. 15, 1960, when Willie Mays hit three of them and Eddie Bressoud had one at Philadelphia's Connie Mack Stadium. The Giants had not accomplished the feat at home since Hack Wilson and Ross Youngs had two triples each against the Boston Braves at New York's Polo Grounds on June 28, 1924, according to STATS.	Buster Posey and Gregor Blanco each had three RBI for the Giants, who built a 7-0 lead by the sixth and won for the fifth time in seven games. San Francisco has won consecutive home games for the first time since May 28-29.	"It was great to see Belt, Crawford and Angel (Pagan) too," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "We needed it, too. The good thing is when they scored, we came back and scored too. It's good to get the bats going, and off a tough pitcher, too. We haven't had a game like this for a while."	Will Middlebrooks tripled for the Padres.	Chris Heston (8-5), who pitched a no-hitter at the New York Mets on June 9, won for the third time in four starts. He gave up two runs and five hits in seven innings, struck out six and walked one.	"I had command of the strike zone," Heston said. "I was able to work both sides of the plate."	James Shields (7-2) allowed seven runs -- his most since June last year -- and nine hits in four-plus innings, his shortest outing this season.	"They jumped on me early to get a couple of runs," Shields said. "After that, I felt like I was pitching well. In the fourth, they got some hits when I executed pitches and they just found holes. Pagan was a 3-2 changeup out of the zone and Posey hit one a foot off the plate and down and he managed to poke it into right."	San Diego closed to 9-8 with a six-run eighth, when Matt Kemp hit a two-run homer and four pinch hitters reached base.	Jeremy Affledt gave up consecutive doubles to pinch-hitters Yangervis Solarte and Clint Barmes ahead of Kemp's drive to center. Pinch-hitter Derek Norris walked and Yonder Alfonso singled against Javier Lopez.	"That felt good and we got back in it," Kemp said. "We still have a lot of fight left in us."	Sergio Romo got two outs, but consecutive singles by Alexi Amarista and pinch-hitter Brett Wallace drove in runs. Solarte singled in his second at-bat of the inning to cut the deficit to one run before Romo retired Barmes on a popout.	San Francisco scored four runs in the bottom half against Shawn Kelley and Brandon Maurer on Posey's two-run double, Crawford's RBI double and Duffy's RBI single.	TRAINER'S TABLE	Padres: Right-hander Brandon Morrow played catch on Tuesday and is expected to throw a simulated game in the next few days before possibly starting a rehab assignment.	Giants: Right-handers Matt Cain (Thursday) and Jake Peavy (Friday) are to make what are slated to be their final rehab starts. Both are expected to join the Giants on their trip to Miami and Washington, with targeted dates of July 2 and 3 for their returns.	UP NEXT	Padres: Tyson Ross (4-7) starts at home against Arizona on Friday night. Ross threw a complete game against the D-backs in his last start, a four-hitter in which he struck out a season-best nine.	Giants: Tim Hudson (5-6) starts against Colorado on Friday night. Since giving up eight runs in a season-low 3 2/3 innings in Colorado a month ago, Hudson has rebounded with a 3.50 ERA in 30 1/3 innings.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

WASHINGTON -- Doug Fister said he really hadn't heard about the scoreless innings streak being crafted by his fellow Washington Nationals starters.	Fister allowed four hits over seven innings in another superb outing by a Washington starter, and the Nationals defeated the Atlanta Braves 7-0 on Thursday for their sixth straight win.	Washington's rotation has thrown a franchise-record 41⅓ consecutive scoreless innings over its past six games, the longest streak in the major leagues since Cleveland starters strung together 44⅓ shutout innings in May 2008.	"Guys aren't even really paying attention to it. That's what makes it great," Fister said of the streak.	In addition to not being aware of the streak, Fister said he doesn't keep track of the score when he pitches.	"And honestly, when I'm at my best, I have no idea what inning it is. I really try and stay simple," he said. "I want to take things one pitch at a time, and if I get anything bigger than that, I'm in trouble myself."	Next up is Max Scherzer, who starts Friday at Philadelphia. Scherzer struck out 16 in a one-hit shutout at Milwaukee on June 14, then pitched a no-hitter against Pittsburgh last Saturday, when he had a perfect game until he hit a batter with two outs in the ninth.	"There's a lot been written," manager Matt Williams said of his rotation, "We all know that. But they've got to go out and pitch well, and we've got to score runs behind them to get them to this point."	Fister (3-3) made his second start since a stint on the disabled list caused by right forearm tightness. He struck out four and walked one in his longest outing of the season.	"I wanted to push myself today, and Skip [Williams] let me go back out there in the seventh," Fister said after throwing 111 pitches.	Blake Treinen finished the Nationals' eighth shutout.	Washington has won eight straight games against the Braves. Ian Desmond had two hits, including a two-run homer, and every Nationals batter had at least one hit.	Braves right fielder Nick Markakis' streak of 398 games without an error, a record for non-pitchers, ended when he bobbled Denard Span's first-inning single.	Matt Wisler (1-1), who won his major league debut last week against the New York Mets, allowed six runs -- four earned -- and nine hits in four innings.	"My fastball command wasn't as sharp as it needed to be," he said. "Balls were staying up."	Cameron Maybin and Kelly Johnson had two hits each for Atlanta, which has scored 13 runs in its past seven games.	Braves miscues played a role in each of Washington's rallies.	"We weren't real pretty to watch today," Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "Let's just put it that way."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: RF Bryce Harper, whose right leg cramped during Wednesday night's game, and Anthony Rendon (sore left quadriceps muscle) were both given the day off.	UP NEXT	Braves: RHP Williams Perez (4-0), who allowed four runs over six innings in his last start, opposes Pittsburgh LHP Francisco Liriano (4-6).	Nationals: Aaron Harang (4-9) starts for Philadelphia against Scherzer.	POSITIVE SIGNS FOR DESMOND	Desmond began the day hitting .220. "The (homer) the other way and the ball through the middle are really good signs," Williams said. "It means he's staying on it, seeing it good. Hope that'll get him hot and get him rolling."	MARKAKIS' MISCUE	Markakis hadn't made an error since August 10, 2012. He recently surpassed Darren Lewis' record of 392 consecutive errorless games. Johnson said the streak hasn't changed the way Markakis plays. "Nick still runs in, charges balls, he still comes in, gets around balls, and tries to get, tries to make the right plays. He's not laying back," Johnson said.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PITTSBURGH --  Guess Brandon Phillips' thumb is OK.	The Cincinnati second baseman hit a long home run off Pittsburgh's Rob Scahill in the top of the 13th to lift the Reds to a 5-4 win on Thursday night. Phillips had three of Cincinnati's season-high 17 hits and started a double play in the eighth with a diving stop and a behind-the-back flip to shortstop Eugenio Suarez.	Not bad for a guy who sat out a game to give his thumb a rest following a collision at second base on Tuesday.	"He had a nice day, did a lot of good things," Cincinnati manager Bryan Price said. "Made some great plays ... It was good to see."	Todd Frazier added three hits for the Reds, including a tying homer in the seventh off Pittsburgh reliever Arquimedes Caminero. The Pirates had been 35-3 when leading after six innings, but the Reds quickly tied it after Pittsburgh starter A.J. Burnett exited. Joey Votto led off with a single that turned into three bases when right fielder Josh Harrison overran the ball. Frazier then pounced on a 99 mph fastball from Caminero and sent it into the bleachers in left for his 24th homer.	"The guy was throwing heat and throwing hard," Frazier said. "I get a fastball, I like to drive `em and I got a pitch to hit. I squared it up and that's all I'm trying to do every at-bat."	Pedro Villarreal (1-2) worked two scoreless innings for his first major league win. The Reds improved to 7-2 against the Pirates this season and have won six of their last eight overall.	"It could be a season changer," Frazier said. "We just keep fighting, we keep scrapping and hopefully by the end of the year we'll be where we need to be."	Harrison, Jordy Mercer and Jung Ho Kang had two hits each for the Pirates, but Pittsburgh left 12 runners on base and went 4 for 13 with runners in scoring position. The Pirates are 2-7 in extra-inning games and have lost five of six.	"We missed some opportunities tonight in some different areas," Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said.	The Reds wasted plenty chances of their own. Cincinnati had at least one baserunner in all but two innings, including two on with no outs in the 11th only to come up empty. Phillips didn't leave it up to chance with his first homer in nearly a month off Scahill (2-4).	Villarreal breezed through three outs in the bottom of the 13th to end the game that lasted 4 hours, 41 minutes, not including a 56-minute rain delay before it started.	"It's definitely been a long road," the 27-year-old Villarreal said. "Baseball's like that. You get knocked down, you've just got to get back up and keep going."	Pittsburgh starter A.J. Burnett labored through six innings, needing 110 pitches to get 18 outs. He failed to retire the Reds in order even once, but left with a 4-2 lead thanks in part to a two-run single he laced up the middle off Cincinnati's Anthony DeSclafani in the second. It was the first multiple-RBI hit of Burnett's 17-year career. The 38-year-old pitcher gave up two runs (one earned) against five strikeouts and two walks to lower his ERA to 2.01.	DeSclafani was more efficient but not as effective, allowing four runs (one earned) with two walks and five strikeouts. Pittsburgh tagged him for three in the second after a throwing error by shortstop Eugenio Suarez and another in the sixth on a run-scoring single by Francisco Cervelli. DeSclafani exited with the Reds trailing, but Pittsburgh's typically reliable bullpen immediately gave the lead away.	JOHNNY B GOOD	Cincinnati ace Johnny Cueto will make his first start in nine days on Friday when the Reds begin a three-game set in New York against the Mets. Manager Bryan Price decided to have Cueto skip a turn in the rotation to give Cueto's aching right arm some added rest. The problem isn't when Cueto pitches, but during his off days. "When he's in competition, there really hasn't been any issues with fatigue or getting loose," Price said. "It's just really more than anything been the time in between his outings. We're trying to get him back to feeling normal in between starts."	Cueto (8-5, 2.98 ERA) is 5-5 with a 4.12 ERA in 10 career starts against the Mets.	UP NEXT	Reds: Cincinnati has had its way with the Mets since New York moved to Citi Field in 2009, going 13-7 in the Mets' new stadium. Phillips has hit safely in each of his 29 road games against New York, batting .350 (41-117) in the process, the second-longest hitting streak by a visitor in Mets' history.	Pirates: Pittsburgh opens a three-game series with Atlanta on Friday. The Pirates took two of three from the Braves on the road earlier this month. Francisco Liriano (4-6, 3.26 ERA) is 2-1 with a 4.00 ERA in three starts against Atlanta. Liriano gave up five runs in his last start, a 6-0 loss to Washington in which the Pirates were no-hit by Max Scherzer.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

MIAMI --  When Lance Lynn threw his final pitch Thursday for strike three to escape a jam, he turned toward center field and screamed something with adrenaline-fueled fervor.	Was it rated PG?	"I don't remember," he said, poker-faced.	Whatever Lynn hollered, he earned his moment of triumph, pitching six shutout innings in his first outing since June 7 to help the St. Louis Cardinals complete a three-game sweep by beating Miami 5-1.	Lynn (5-4), who had been on the disabled list with a strained forearm, allowed only two hits and lowered his ERA to 2.84.	"That was a good one to come back to," he said.	"He was awesome," teammate Pete Kozma said. "He was doing what he did before he went on the DL."	Backup infielder Kozma, who came into the game hitless in his past 21 at-bats, singled three times, scored twice and drove in a run for his second RBI this year. His average rose to from .093 to .140.	"A good night all the way around for Pete," manager Mike Matheny said. "When it gets to the point where you're hitting .100, you really start pressing a little bit. I say that from experience."	The sweep was the first for the Cardinals in Miami since Aug. 4-7, 2011, and their first on the road this year.	"That's news to me," Matheny said.	The rarity of the road sweep is surprising given that the Cardinals (48-24) have the best record in the majors. They went 5-3 on a three-city trip to move a season-high 24 games above .500.	Miami (30-44) fell a season-worst 14 games under .500.	"It's very hard," losing pitcher Dan Haren said in the clubhouse. "Obviously it's pretty much dead silent in here now. I don't know where to gauge it. Things aren't going well."	Haren (6-5) allowed four runs in six-plus innings.	Miami's Adeiny Hechavarria hit his fourth homer off the foul pole with two outs in the ninth to avert a shutout. Four St. Louis relievers completed a four-hitter.	The Marlins have lost seven of their past eight games while scoring a total of 17 runs, and their defense is slumping, too. Second baseman Dee Gordon had two errors, doubling his season total.	The Marlins' leadoff batter in the third inning reached second base, but Lynn escaped. He walked consecutive batters with two outs in the sixth before striking out Marcell Ozuna with his final pitch, preserving a 1-0 lead.	"That could have gone in a real bad direction," Matheny said. "Fortunately he was able to finish it off."	Miami went 0 for 5 with runners in scoring position, and 1 for 17 in the series in those situations.	"We're 2 for 28 our last two series with runners in scoring position," manager Dan Jennings said. "That's not going to get it done."	Lynn improved to 4-0 lifetime in six games against the Marlins.	Haren retired the first seven batters before his pitch brushed Kozma, who scored on a two-out double by Kolten Wong.	The Cardinals added three runs in the seventh while hitting one ball hard. They reached on back-to-back bunt singles, Mike Dunn walked in a run, and Kozma scored on Mark Reynolds' popup to Gordon, who caught the ball in short right field with his back to the plate.	RESTED	Kozma played for SS Jhonny Peralta, who was given the day off and was out of the starting lineup for only the second time this season.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals LHP Jaime Garcia, hobbled by a cramp in the eighth inning Wednesday, was back in the weight room Thursday and on target to make his next start as scheduled. "At this point, he's going to try to stay on his normal program," Matheny said. "If anything doesn't feel right, we'll back off."	UP NEXT	Cardinals: RHP John Lackey (6-4, 3.41) is scheduled to start Friday when St. Louis opens a three-game series against the Cubs at home.	"Pretty good showdown this weekend," Lynn said.	Marlins: LHP Justin Nicolino, who threw seven shutout innings against Cincinnati to win his major league debut, is scheduled to pitch Friday for Miami against the Dodgers.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

HOUSTON -- Astros manager A.J. Hinch showed confidence in his ace to let him finish what he started Thursday night.	Dallas Keuchel pitched a six-hitter and struck out a career-high 12 in his second shutout in less than a month to lead the Houston Astros to a 4-0 win over the New York Yankees.	"I haven't been here a long time but that's probably as good as I've seen Dallas Keuchel," Hinch said. "The game plan for him is to use his pitches and be aggressive. His ball is moving all over the place tonight which made them have to be aggressive."	Keuchel (9-3) gave up six singles and walked one while topping his previous best of 11 strikeouts in a shutout over the White Sox on May 30.	"Probably, just based on command and stuff wise," Keuchel said when asked if it was the best he felt. "I got a few pitches early, but they weren't really aggressive early pitch wise. That led to an advantage for me then later in the game, they started hacking. I was able to get all four pitches over, and that was crucial for me. I was also able to calm down."	The left-hander retired 18 of 19 during one stretch, including 15 straight before Alex Rodriguez's single with two outs in the ninth. Mark Texeira then walked prompting a trip to the mound by Hinch.	"I told him finish the game, I want to go home," Hinch said. "I think the game should be over and it was his game to finish. That's exactly what I told him."	Carlos Beltran singled to load the bases, but Keuchel got Jose Pirela to ground into a force out to end the game.	Keuchel rebounded from his worst start of the season when he allowed five runs and walked four Saturday at Seattle.	"It seems like division games I get a little too amped up for, and it was very uncharacteristic of me in Seattle," Keuchel said. "I wanted to take a step back and relax a little coming out of the gate and find my groove."	Jose Altuve had three hits and scored three times. Evan Gattis had an RBI single in the sixth and an RBI double in the eighth.	Adam Warren (5-5) allowed three runs -- two earned -- and five hits with four strikeouts in 5 2/3 innings for the Yankees. The loss was Warren's first in four starts. He has allowed three runs or fewer in each of his last nine starts.	Preston Tucker's RBI double gave Houston a 1-0 lead in the second.	Colby Rasmus' sacrifice fly scored Altuve to stretch the Astros' lead to 2-0 in the fourth.	Chris Young and Beltran each had two of New York's six hits as the Yankees lost for the fourth time in five games.	"Well he stays down in the zone, he's using the corners, and he's using the zone," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said of Keuchel. "He attacks, he's ahead all night. He wasn't behind in too many counts. We got a few hits but we never put anything together. We hit a couple balls hard foul. He pitched well."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: CF Jacoby Ellsbury, out since May 19 with a sprained right knee, is improving and Girardi hopes that he can return sometime during this road trip which ends July 1. "We need to get him to run 100 percent before we feel comfortable sending him out on a short rehab," Girardi said. "You want to see him turn it loose and be able to feel good the next day and say ... there are no issues."	Astros: RHP Scott Feldman, who had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee on May 29, threw off the mound on Thursday in a bullpen session. "He's making steady progress," Hinch said. "From all indications from the medical staff, he's step by step doing better." Feldman's recovery is expected to take about six weeks."	UP NEXT	Yankees: RHP Nathan Eovaldi (6-2) will start the second game of the series against the Astros looking to set a career-high with his seventh win this season.	Astros: RHP Vince Velasquez is still looking for his first career win after three straight no-decisions. Velasquez only allowed a run in his last start but lasted just 3 1/3 innings after throwing 93 pitches.	A-ROD LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING CORREA	Rodriguez was looking forward to getting a good look at Houston rookie shortstop Carlos Correa during this series. Correa, who was the top overall pick in the 2012 draft, is often compared to Rodriguez. He hoped to get to spend some time with Correa, and reminisced about meeting a star shortstop when he was a young player.	"I remember clearly when I broke into the league and we played against the Baltimore Orioles and (meeting) Cal Ripken and to me as an 18-year-old that was one of the biggest thrills of my life," Rodriguez said. "I had a chance to have a little meet and greet with him for 10 minutes ... before batting practice at the old Kingdome and to me that's still one of the 10 minutes that I cherish."	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

BALTIMORE --  Saturday night's game between the Cleveland Indians and Baltimore Orioles has been postponed by rain.	It will be made up Sunday as part of a separate-admission doubleheader. The originally scheduled game Sunday is set for 1:35 p.m. and the makeup is slated to begin at 7:05 p.m.	Rain soaked the Baltimore area for much of Saturday and was not expected to let up until well after midnight, forcing the postponement.	This is the Indians' lone scheduled visit to Camden Yards.	Knowing the weather forecast heading into the weekend, the Orioles scratched right-hander Kevin Gausman from his start at Triple-A Norfolk on Friday. He will likely be recalled to start one of the games on Sunday.	Baltimore won the opener of the three-game series Friday night, 4-3.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PHILADELPHIA -- Max Scherzer has been so dominant that teammates are surprised when he actually gives up a hit.	Scherzer took a perfect game into the sixth inning in his bid to become the second pitcher in major league history to throw two consecutive no-hitters, and the Washington Nationals beat the Philadelphia Phillies 5-2 on Friday night.	On a day Phillies manager Ryne Sandberg resigned, Scherzer stole the show.	Scherzer (9-5) retired the first 16 batters before Freddy Galvis doubled on a 1-1 pitch to the right-field wall. The Nationals right-hander allowed two runs and five hits in eight innings.	"Once you get through the order first time through, you know you have something going," Scherzer said. "But, it's hard. It takes luck, and when you make mistakes, they have to mis-hit it."	Scherzer tossed a no-hitter Saturday against Pittsburgh, falling one strike shy of a perfect game before hitting Jose Tabata on a 3-2 pitch with two outs. He threw a one-hitter, striking out 16, in his previous start.	But he couldn't match Johnny Vander Meer, who threw two straight no-hitters for the Cincinnati Reds in June 1938. The deepest a pitcher took a no-hitter after throwing one was the Reds' Ewell Blackwell, who allowed a one-out hit in the ninth inning against Brooklyn in 1947.	"It's an unbelievable feat," Scherzer said of Vander Meer. "It seems so improbable he was able to do that."	Scherzer has taken a no-hitter into the sixth inning in three straight starts.	"Every time he goes out there, it seems he's going to be perfect," outfielder Matt den Dekker said. "It's fun to watch."	Phillies starter Aaron Harang (4-10) gave up five runs -- four earned -- and nine hits in six innings to drop his seventh straight decision.	Drew Storen pitched the ninth for his 22nd save in 24 chances. The game ended when Domonic Brown ran through a stop sign at third base on Cody Asche's single and was tagged out in a rundown.	Wilson Ramos drove in Washington's first run on an infield single in the first. Den Dekker hit a two-run homer in the sixth to make it 5-0.	Scherzer singled to extend his hitting streak to six games and scored on Danny Espinosa's sacrifice fly in the fifth. Another run scored in the inning when right fielder Brown dropped Ramos' liner for an error.	Brown hit an RBI double off Scherzer in the seventh, and pinch hitter Ben Revere hit his third career homer in 2,194 at-bats in the eighth.	"He was really good again, complete comfort and dominance," Nationals manager Matt Williams said.	Sandberg quit with a 119-159 career record over parts of three seasons leading Philadelphia. His only full season was in 2014, when the Phillies finished with a 73-89 record. Third-base coach Pete Mackanin replaced him on an interim basis.	"He wasn't real happy about his decision, but I think he might be a little relieved at this point," Mackanin said of Sandberg.	MILESTONE WIN	Scherzer's victory was No. 100 in his career. The 2012 AL Cy Young Award winner had 82 wins for Detroit and nine for Arizona before coming to Washington this season.	"To be able to win 100 in the show, it's special," he said.	STELLAR STARTERS	The Nationals had a franchise-record streak of 47 1/3 scoreless innings by their starters snapped in the seventh. It was the second-longest streak since 1961, trailing the 1974 Orioles, who had a streak of 54 innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: RF Bryce Harper, whose right leg cramped during Wednesday night's game, missed his second straight game. 3B Anthony Rendon was placed on the 15-day DL because of a sore left quadriceps. CF Denard Span was scratched from the lineup due to back spasms.	UP NEXT	LHP Gio Gonzalez (5-4, 4.41 ERA) goes for Washington against Phillies lefty Adam Morgan (1-0, 1.59) on Saturday afternoon. Morgan beat the St. Louis Cardinals in his major league debut Sunday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PITTSBURGH --  Jordy Mercer's confidence never wavered during another lethargic start at the plate, one that saw him ceding at-bats and playing time to Pittsburgh Pirates rookie teammate Jung Ho Kang.	The streaky shortstop flourished after a bumpy beginning a year ago. He knew if he just kept grinding, things would even out.	"The last couple weeks I've been hitting the ball so hard, seeing it so well," Mercer said. "I'm in a good place."	Certainly looks like it. Mercer doubled home Andrew McCutchen with one out in the bottom of the 10th inning to lift the Pirates to a 3-2 win over the Atlanta Braves on Friday night.	McCutchen doubled off former teammate Jason Grilli (2-3) leading off the inning and three batters later, Mercer's third hit of the game smacked off the right-field wall as the Pirates won for just the second time in their last seven games.	"Leadoff guy gets on, sometimes you can create a situation when a leadoff guy gets on," said Grilli, an All-Star closer for the Pirates in 2013. "I tried to make some pitches and just didn't (do it)."	Mark Melancon (1-1) pitched a scoreless top of the 10th for Pittsburgh as the Pirates' bullpen didn't allow a hit in three innings of relief. Pedro Alvarez added two RBI for the Pirates.	"We have grown into a team that believes it can get things done," Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said. "We've still got work to do."	Juan Uribe homered for Atlanta and Eury Perez had two hits, but the Braves dropped their fourth straight game.	SCARY MOMENT	Atlanta's Williams Perez came in unbeaten and had little trouble until the fifth, when a liner off Josh Harrison's bat drilled Perez in his right foot. Perez lay on his stomach for several moments while being tended to by trainers.	He opted to stay in the game, but with his plant leg hobbled, his control abandoned him. Perez walked Neil Walker on four pitches, balked Walker to second and then hit McCutchen before leaving.	X-rays on the ankle were negative though Perez was wearing a walking boot after the game as a precaution.	"Things like this happen," Perez said. "It's part of the game. I dodged a bullet and I'm hoping to be out there soon."	Luis Avilan came on to replace Perez, but gave up an infield single to Starling Marte and a flare to center by Alvarez that scored to Walker and McCutchen. The first RBI off a left-hander by the left-handed Alvarez this season gave Pittsburgh the lead.	It didn't last long. Uribe took a changeup from Pittsburgh starter Francisco Liriano and sent it out of McCutchen's reach and over the wall in center field for just his third homer since coming to Atlanta in a trade with the Dodgers a month ago.	Liriano bounced back from a rough outing last Saturday in Washington when he was on the losing end of Max Scherzer's no-hitter, giving up two runs on six hits with three walks and three strikeouts. He also made it through seven innings, giving the middle of Pittsburgh's bullpen a needed respite following a heavy workload during the team's recent dip.	The Pirates ran themselves out of a chance to win the game in the ninth, but had little trouble getting to Grilli, who revived his career with the Pirates from 2011-14. McCutchen jumped on Grilli's fastball that jumped over the left-field wall for a ground-rule double. Grilli intentionally walked Marte and after Alvarez struck out Mercer's fly to right kept carrying as McCutchen raced home.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Braves: Atlanta placed RHP Brandon Cunniff on the 15-day disabled list Friday with a right groin strain and recalled RHP Sugar Ray Marimon from Triple-A Gwinnett. Cunniff tweaked the groin in his last appearance against Washington on Thursday. Marimon is 3-2 with a 3.49 ERA in 10 career appearances.	Pirates: Pittsburgh placed RHP Rob Scahill on the 15-day disabled list with right forearm tightness. Scahill (2-4) had given up a run in each of his last two appearances, including the winning home run to Cincinnati's Brandon Phillips in a 5-4, 13-inning loss Thursday night. ... Pittsburgh brought up RHP Deolis Guerra from Triple-A Indianapolis and transferred 1B/OF Andrew Lambo to the 60-day disabled list while he recovers from a bout of plantar fasciitis in his left foot.	UP NEXT	Braves: Julio Tehran (5-3, 4.67 ERA) starts for Atlanta. Tehran is 2-0 with a 3.29 ERA in five games against Pittsburgh.	Pirates: RHP Charlie Morton will try to bounce back from a nightmarish start last Sunday in Washington, when he gave up nine runs while failing to get out of the first inning, the shortest start of his career. Morton's ERA ballooned to 3.97 while taking his first loss of the season after winning each of his first five starts in his return from offseason hip surgery.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

TORONTO --  Edwin Encarnacion was just trying to hit a sacrifice fly. He ended up giving the Blue Jays a whole lot more.	Encarnacion hit his seventh career grand slam and added a solo homer as the Blue Jays handed the slumping Texas Rangers their season-high sixth straight loss, 12-2 Friday night.	"Every time he steps in the box, he's got a chance to go deep," manager John Gibbons said.	Encarnacion had three hits and narrowly missed a third home run in his final at-bat, flying out to the warning track in left against Rangers infielder Adam Rosales.	Russell Martin and Danny Valencia each hit solo homers for the Blue Jays, who improved to 17-7 in June and boosted their ML-leading run total to 417.	Mark Buehrle (8-4) pitched seven innings to win his third straight decision, improving to 2-0 with a 1.75 ERA in five June starts. Buehrle allowed two runs and five hits.	"When you get 10-plus runs scored for you, it makes it a lot easier," Buehrle said.	Encarnacion gave the Blue Jays all the runs Buehrle would need with a first inning blast to center off Nick Martinez (5-4), then went deep off Ross Detwiler in the seventh. It was Encarnacion's 20th multihomer game.	"Very exciting moment for me and the team," Encarnacion said of his grand slam, the second of the season for the Blue Jays.	Encarnacion's slam marked the ML-leading 29th time Toronto has scored four or more runs in an inning.	"We've been doing that all year," Gibbons said. "It's not easy. We've been making it look easy, but it's not that easy."	Toronto has won 11 of the past 14 meetings with Texas, including eight of 12 at home.	Prince Fielder hit his 300th career homer, joining father Cecil in the 300-home run club and giving baseball its second father-son duo to reach the plateau. Bobby Bonds (332) and career leader Barry Bonds (762) are the only other father and son to reach the 300-homer mark.	"That's pretty good company," Fielder said.	It's the longest losing streak for Texas since an eight-game slide from Aug. 30-Sept. 6, 2014. The Rangers (37-37) fell to .500 for the first time since May 30, when they were 25-25.	"We need to figure out what we can do better," manager Jeff Banister said.	Martinez allowed nine runs, eight earned, and nine hits in six innings. He has won just once in his past six starts.	"I fell behind a lot of guys," Martinez said.	Rosales became the ninth position player to pitch for the Rangers when he came on in the eighth. The last to do it was J.P. Arencibia, who pitched against Tampa Bay on Aug. 13, 2014.	"I just threw all straight balls," Rosales said. "I didn't try to put anything on them. I tried one in warm ups but that wasn't going to happen. I don't have the control with the off-speed."	QUICK OFF THE MARK	The last time Toronto led 4-0 four batters into a game was July 8, 2012. In that game, Colby Rasmus and Encarnacion both hit two-run homers.	PRINCELY PERFORMANCE	Fielder went 2 for 4 with a double and leads the majors with 31 multihit games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: RHP Matt Harrison (back surgery) threw a 35 pitch bullpen session in front of manager Jeff Banister and pitching coach Mike Maddux. Harrison is set to throw another session on Sunday.	Blue Jays: Toronto activated 2B Devon Travis (left shoulder) off the 15-day DL and optioned INF Munenori Kawasaki to Triple-A.	UP NEXT	Rangers: RHP Yovani Gallardo is 3-0 with a 1.22 ERA in his past six starts, lowering his ERA from 4.26 to 2.98 in that span. Gallardo has not allowed a run in his past 15 innings.	Blue Jays: Toronto selected LHP Matt Boyd from Triple-A Buffalo to make his MLB debut Saturday. Boyd went 7-2 with a 1.26 ERA in 14 starts at Double-A and Triple-A this season. He'll start in place of RHP Aaron Sanchez (strained back muscle). RHP Rob Rasmussen was optioned to Buffalo.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DETROIT --  The Tigers are not surprised by Miguel Cabrera's latest hot streak.	J.D. Martinez's recent stellar run, now that's something Detroit can be impressed with.	In his last 12 games before Saturday's rainout against the White Sox, Martinez was hitting .347 with nine homers and 19 RBI.	"Honestly, it just feels like I'm getting maybe one hit a game but it just happens to be a home run," said Martinez, who hit the go-ahead longball in the eighth inning of Friday night's 5-4 win. "So it's kind of one of those things right now where I can't explain it."	The teams will make up the game during a split-doubleheader Sept. 21.	Martinez got off to a slow start, his batting average dropping below .220 in early May and some to wonder if last year's .315 average and 23 homers were just a fluke.	He ended that talk by hitting .313 in his last 43 games, including 13 homers. He has 19 overall.	"He's put very consistent swings on the ball in the last few weeks," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said. "He went through a stretch early in the season, I think it was in May, where he really scuffled for about 40 at-bats and now we're seeing the complete opposite."	The White Sox were pleased they would have one fewer game against Cabrera while he was on one of his torrid streaks.	In Cabrera's last 13 games, he is hitting .479 (23 for 48) with three homers, 14 RBI. He had three doubles against Chicago on Friday night.	"He's the best hitter in baseball," Ventura said after the game. "You know you aren't going to stop him, so you just try to keep the ball in the yard. ... He's the rare guy that, when he hits a single off of you, you just shrug and work with it.	"Unfortunately, he didn't hit many singles at all today," he added. "He never hits many singles."	ROTATION JUGGLING	Both teams fiddled with their rotations as the result of the unexpected off-day, especially with each club being off Monday.	John Danks had been scheduled to face Kyle Ryan on Saturday, but neither will pitch on Sunday. Instead both Sunday starters -- Jeff Samardzjia and David Price -- will stay in their spots in the rotation.	Chicago will use Chris Sale and Carlos Quintana Tuesday and Wednesday in St. Louis, while the Tigers will wait for the results of Justin Verlander's bullpen session earlier Saturday to decide on their rotation for a home series against Pittsburgh.	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox: RHP Matt Albers started a rehab assignment with Triple-A Charlotte on Friday as he recovers from a broken pinkie on his pitching hand. Albers, who has been sidelined since April 20, threw a scoreless eighth inning in a 3-1 win.	Tigers: C Alex Avila (knee) went 1 for 3 in his first injury rehab game for Triple-A Toledo. Avila said that his legs felt good after catching, but the Tigers still plan to keep him with the Mud Hens for eight days, in order to build up his leg strength.	UP NEXT	The teams finish their abbreviated series on Sunday, with Samardzjia facing Price. Price is 5-5 with a 3.12 career ERA against Chicago, while Samardzjia ended a four-start slump by allowing two runs over seven innings in a June 23 win over the Twins.	HAIR BANTER	After the game's postponement, Cabrera took to Twitter to address Price's online ads for Head and Shoulders shampoo. Price's tweet mentioned that he was "100 (percent) Flake Free," and Cabrera responded "Flakes??? U are bald and have no hair! (hashtag)conspiracy"	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

NEW YORK -- The way Noah Syndergaard was pitching, the New York Mets barely needed their bats.	Syndergaard threw eight sharp innings and the light-hitting Mets got a break when Cincinnati ace Johnny Cueto suddenly lost the strike zone, edging the Reds 2-1 Friday night.	The Mets returned home from a 1-7 road trip in which they totaled 11 runs, and won despite getting only two hits.	"We've got the pitching," manager Terry Collins said. "There's nothing wrong with our pitching. We've just got to give them some help."	With the Mets set to call up prized prospect Steven Matz this weekend and go to a six-man rotation, Syndergaard (3-4) was in control. The 22-year-old rookie said he had no trouble with adding an extra starter, especially if it meant pitching deeper into games -- and deeper into the season.	"My ultimate goal is to be able to pitch in October," Syndergaard said.	The Reds lost for the third time in nine games. They got to their New York hotel at 4:17 a.m. after a rain-delayed, 13-inning win at Pittsburgh.	Curtis Granderson launched a leadoff homer into the second deck on Cueto's third pitch.	"He hits home runs in clumps," Collins said after Granderson connected for the fourth time in six games.	It was 1-all in the fifth when Dilson Herrera tripled with two outs. Cueto (4-5), pitching with eight days' rest to give his aching right elbow some extra rest, hadn't walked a batter all game until walking Granderson, Eric Campbell and Lucas Duda to force home the go-ahead run.	Duda had already struck out twice, and had fanned 10 times in 15 career at-bats against Cueto, before hanging in after two quick strikes. Catcher Brayan Pena twice went to the mound to talk to Cueto once the count went full.	"Things happen. I was too much careful in that inning. I did not want to leave the ball in the middle," Cueto said through a translator.	"I was trying to trick them," he said.	Syndergaard gave up five singles, walked none and struck out five in the longest of his nine starts in the majors. He hit 99 mph with his fastball in the first inning, mixed in his changeups and curves against an aggressive lineup and won for the first time in five starts.	The Mets' infield backed him all night. Shortstop Wilmer Flores, third baseman Ruben Tejada and Herrera at second and Duda at first each made nice plays, and catcher Kevin Plawecki caught a runner trying to steal.	Jeurys Familia pitched a perfect ninth for his 21st save in 23 chances.	Collins said before the game that Granderson might be able to ignite the team. He was right, as Granderson hit his 32nd career leadoff home run and fourth this season.	The Reds tied it in the second when Jay Bruce and Pena opened with singles, setting up an RBI grounder by Chris Dominguez.	Brandon Phillips singled in the third, and has hit safely in all 30 games he's played on the road against the Mets.	EVEN IN NEW YORK	The loss left Cincinnati 148-148 when visiting the Mets over the years at the Polo Grounds, Shea Stadium and Citi Field.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: All-Star C Devin Mesoraco will have surgery in New York on Monday to fix an impingement in his left hip. He hasn't caught since April 12 and has been on the disabled list since May 25.	Mets: Tejada exited soon after being hit in the left elbow by a pitch from Cueto. X-rays were negative, and Tejada has a bruise. Collins said he might need a day to recover.	UP NEXT	Reds: Rookie RHP Michael Lorenzen (3-2, 3.56) has won two straight starts. He's allowed more than three runs just once in nine big league starts.	Mets: RHP Matt Harvey (7-5, 3.18) has given up a total of one run in his last two outings. That followed a string of four rough starts in a row.	HOOPLA	Newly drafted Kris Porzingis and Jerian Grant of the New York Knicks threw out ceremonial first balls. Both tosses made it to the plate on the fly.	REMEMBERED	The Mets held a pregame moment of silence for former owner Nelson Doubleday Jr. and former outfielder Darryl Hamilton.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MIAMI --  Brett Anderson tied a career high with 10 strikeouts and allowed only one fly ball in seven innings Friday night to help the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 7-1 victory over the Miami Marlins, who lost their fifth straight game.	Major league home run and RBI leader Giancarlo Stanton hurt his left hand, grimaced in pain with his final swing in the ninth inning and underwent X-rays after the game. The extent of the injury wasn't determined, and the Marlins slugger was to undergo further evaluation Saturday.	Scott Van Slyke, filling in again for the injured Yasiel Puig, hit a two-run homer. Howie Kendrick tied a season high with four hits, and Jimmy Rollins had a two-run single.	Anderson (4-4) allowed the leadoff batter in the first inning to score but was otherwise unscathed. He had an RBI single, hiking his average this year to .100.	Two relievers completed a six-hitter. The Marlins' final 10 outs were strikeouts, and they struck out a season-high 16 times.	Stanton winced as he swung and missed for strike three in the ninth. He said he hurt his hand earlier in the game, and the injury progressively became more painful.	The Dodgers have won three consecutive games on their three-city trip to improve to 15-20 on the road. They have allowed only 10 runs in the past six games.	Marlins manager Dan Jennings called a team meeting before the game to give his players a pep talk, but they again showed little pep, falling a season-worst 15 games under .500 (30-45). They have lost eight of their past nine games, and during that stretch they are batting .201 and have scored 18 runs.	Miami's Dee Gordon, who leads the major leagues in hits, had three singles against his former team. But the Marlins went 0 for 5 with runners in scoring position, and they are batting .105 in those situations in the past nine games.	Odds of an offensive breakout this weekend are not good, with Miami facing Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke in the next two games.	Anderson, whose groundball percentage is the highest in the majors, didn't allow a fly ball until the sixth inning, and the left-hander helped himself in the third inning by picking two runners off first base. J.T. Realmuto and Gordon were both out 1-3-6 after reaching on singles.	Miami rookie Justin Nicolino (1-1) flopped in the follow-up to his impressive major-league debut, when he pitched seven shutout innings to beat the Reds. The left-hander allowed five runs in four innings and departed after throwing only 62 pitches.	The Marlins' Jarred Cosart, recovered from a bout with a vertigo, allowed two runs in four innings in his first outing since May 13, and his first career relief appearance.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: Before the game, the Dodgers reinstated RHP Pedro Baez (right pectoral strain) from the DL and optioned LHP Ian Thomas to Triple-A Oklahoma City. Baez struck out all three batters he faced in the ninth. ... LHP Paco Rodriguez (elbow) is expected to come off the DL on Monday. ... Puig was out of the starting lineup for the third straight game because of an open callus on his left hand. He pinch-hit in the eighth and grounded out.	UP NEXT	Kershaw (5-5, 3.33) is scheduled to start Saturday against RHP Tom Koehler (5-4, 3.76).	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  The Boston Red Sox didn't blame Mookie Betts for a baserunning blunder, and neither did the speedy outfielder.	Betts overcame getting thrown out on the bases late in a tie game, doubling to extend his career-best hitting streak to 13 games and scoring on Brock Holt's 10th-inniing single to give his team a 4-3 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays on Friday night.	"I wasn't necessarily trying to make up for anything. I was just trying to help the team get a run across," Betts said. "Fortunately I got a ball to fall and Brock got a hit behind me."	Betts was in danger of losing Boston's longest hitting streak in two years after reaching on a fielder's choice in the seventh and getting thrown out after stealing second.	The young leadoff man took several steps off the bag when catcher Curt Casali's throw sailed over second baseman Logan Forsythe's head. He stopped abruptly when he realized centerfielder Kevin Kiermaier was backing up the play, but stumbled on his way back to the base and was easily tagged out.	"We put a hit and run on, the ball goes into center field and his first instinct is to go. Kiermaier does a great job of backing up and he gets hung up off the base," Boston manager John Farrell said. "We've seen a number of number of times when things don't go right for him and comes right back to find a way to contribute."	That's exactly what Betts did given one more chance to extend his hitting streak, lifting a perfectly placed fly ball that dropped down the left field line for the Red Sox's longest hitting since Jacoby Ellsbury had a 19-game streak in 2013.	Holt followed with his game-winning hit off Steve Geltz (1-3).	"I didn't hit the ball hard but I got it to fall," Betts said. "That was the main thing."	Alexi Ogando (2-0) came out of the bullpen in the ninth inning to get the win, retiring the only batter he faced to escape a jam with runners at second and third base. Koji Uehara pitched a perfect 10th for his 15th save.	Alejandro De Aza and Jackie Bradley, Jr. drove in second-inning runs to help Boston build a 3-1 lead against Alex Colome, who allowed four hits, walked five and struck out two over six innings.	Newly acquired Marc Krauss doubled to drive in a run his first at-bat for Tampa Bay, and the Rays scored twice in the sixth on David DeJesus' sacrifice fly and a wild pitch to make it 3-3.	Red Sox starter Rick Porcello, who has lost six straight decisions since last winning at Seattle on May 16, allowed three runs and nine hits in six innings. The right-hander walked one and struck out five in an outing he felt was a step in the right direction.	" Obviously you want to win and help the team any way you can, and when you don't it's frustrating. It's even more frustrating win you feel like you're not too far off from having quality starts," Porcello said. "It's certainly been a frustrating stretch but this is a positive start but I hope from here to keep getting better and get back to the right track."	The Rays, needing help at first base because of injuries, obtained Krauss from the Los Angeles Angels for minor league pitcher Kyle Winkler on Thursday.  His second-inning double drove in Logan Forsythe, who had three hits off Porcello.	The Rays outhit the Red Sox 12-10, but stranded eight while going 1 for 7 with runners in scoring position. Asdrubal Cabrera doubled and Jake Elmore was walked intentionally to begin the ninth, but the Rays failed to get down a sacrifice bunt in a critical situation for the second straight game and wound up wasting an opportunity to win it.	"It's definitely frustrating. We had several situations to get a job done and we just didn't get it done, plain and simple," Rays outfielder Steven Souza Jr. said. "In order to win ballgames like that, we have to come with clutch hits in those big opportunities."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: LF Hanley Ramirez (left hand) missed his second straight game and is day to day. ... RF Shane Victorino (left calf) will continue playing for Triple-A Pawtucket this weekend before joining Double-A Portland.	Rays: LHP Matt Moore (elbow surgery) had what could be his final rehab start for Triple-A Durham pushed back because of rain, likely delaying his return to the rotation until at least next Thursday. ... RHP Jake Odorizzi (oblique) will throw batting practice Saturday. ... 1B James Loney (broken left middle finger) hit off a tee.	HOT BAT	De Aza, acquired by the Red Sox from Baltimore for minor league pitcher Joe Gunkel and cash on June 3, had a run-scoring double in the second and is batting .333 (10 for 30) with six extra-base hits and eight RBI over his last eight games.  He hit his first home run for Boston during an 8-6 loss to Baltimore on Thursday.	NO STEAL	1B Mike Napoli scored Boston's third run, sprinting home from third base in the fourth inning on Casali `s throw to second to catch Blake Swihart stealing. Napoli was not given a stolen base on the play. The official scorer ruled he advanced on the throw	Napoli, who walked three times and scored twice, did wind up getting his second steal of the season in the sixth, swiping second base.	MOVING DAY	Red Sox: INF Jeff Bianchi, designated for assignment June 15, cleared waivers and was outrighted to Triple-A Pawtucket.	Rays: 1B Allan Dykstra and INF Eugenio Velez were released by Triple-A Durham.	UP NEXT	Red Sox LHP Wade Miley (7-6) and Rays RHP Matt Andriese (2-2) are Saturday's starters. Miley is 3-0 with a 0.47 ERA in three starts against Tampa Bay, and he hasn't allowed a run over 12 innings at Tropicana Field.

MILWAUKEE --  Kyle Lohse received early run support for all the cushion he needed to become the 14th pitcher in MLB history to beat all 30 active franchises.	Lohse pitched six effective innings and benefited from Milwaukee's six-run first inning to get his first win since May 16 as the Brewers beat the Twins 10-4 on Friday night.	"It's pretty cool," the 36-year-old right-hander said. "These guys tell me that I'm old and I've been around, but that's only the third time I've faced them so it's not like I've faced them a whole bunch of times and haven't beaten them."	Still Lohse (4-9) took satisfaction in the milestone victory.	"It's an accomplishment I'm proud of," he said. "I've been around and that proves I've had some longevity and done some things in this game. So I'll go home happy about that."	The 13-year veteran broke into the majors with the Twins in 2001, and spent six seasons in Minnesota before being traded to Cincinnati in exchange for right-hander Zach Ward on July 31, 2006.	Lohse gave up four runs and six hits, struck out two and walked one. He had lost three straight starts and was 0 for 5 with a 7.59 ERA in his last six. He had not won since beating the Mets 7-0 in New York.	Brian Dozier homered to lead off the game, but Gerardo Parra answered with his own leadoff clout in the bottom of the first that started an offense that's been struggling to score.	The Brewers batted around, scoring six runs on six hits. Jean Segura had a two-run double, Ryan Braun had a run-scoring single and then scored when starter Trevor May (4-6) threw wide of second on a fielder's choice. Lohse added the last run on a sacrifice that ended May's night. Alex Meyer took over in his major-league debut and retired the 10th and 11th batters of the inning on fly balls to end it.	"The error was big," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. "That's a possible double play, so it's a big play. We had a chance to break it open in the first and tonight we did."	May got mixed up on who he wanted to throw the ball to after fielding Carlos Gomez's comebacker to the mound. May mistakenly tried to hit shortstop Eduardo Nunez who was running toward second for a force play and threw the ball behind him.	"Unfortunately, I had it in my head that I was picking up the wrong infielder," said May, who was charged with the six runs and six hits in just one-third of an inning. "When I saw he wasn't at the bag, I tried to hold onto the ball a little bit too long and airmailed it into center."	Lohse also gave up a homer to Trevor Plouffe, increasing his total to 19 allowed -- second-most in the majors -- in 16 starts. Colorado's Kyle Kendrick leads the way, having allowed 21.	Aramis Ramirez and Scooter Gennett also homered to power the Brewers and help spoil the return of fan favorite Paul Molitor, who is in his first year as manager of the Twins. The Hall of Famer spent the majority of his 21-year career in Milwaukee.	In the second, Ramirez lined his ninth homer of the season, a two-run shot, and Gennett hit a solo home run.	Neal Cotts pitched two scoreless innings and Jonathan Broxton finished the game with a perfect ninth.	Eddie Rosario hit into a run-scoring fielder's choice in the fourth and Plouffe hit a two-run shot in the sixth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Twins: RHP Ricky Nolasco briefly threw off the rubber Friday. "It didn't go well," Molitor said. "My indication is it didn't take long for them to realize the symptoms are still the same. We just can't seem to find the solution to getting him back in the right direction." Nolasco has been on the 15-day DL since early April with right elbow inflammation. ... OF Aaron Hicks, sidelined since June 13, continues to make progress recovering from a right forearm strain. He played for Triple-A Rochester in a rehab assignment.	Brewers: OF Carlos Gomez and 3B Aramis Ramirez were back in the starting lineup after getting Thursday off to rest, though Gomez was used as a defensive replacement in the finale against the New York Mets. ... LF Khris Davis, on the 15-day DL with a torn meniscus in his right knee, ran the bases during batting practice. Manager Craig Counsell said Davis might be ready for a rehab assignment, possibly as early as next week.	UP NEXT	Twins: RHP Kyle Gibson (4-6) looks to snap a three-game losing streak facing the Brewers for the second time this season. He did not figure in the 10-5 home-field loss on June 5.	Brewers: RHP Matt Garza (4-9) makes his second start of the season against Minnesota. He beat them 4-2 at Target Field on June 6. He is 2-1 with a 1.65 ERA in four career starts against the Twins.	SWINGING FOR THE FENCE	Dozier hit his fourth leadoff home run this season and the 11th of his career.	MILESTONE REACHED	Adam Lind's base hit in the fourth was the 1,000th of his eight-year career.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

HOUSTON --  Two New York Yankees from Houston stole the show against the Astros on Friday night.	Chris Young had a go-ahead, three-run homer among three more hits in his hometown, lifting the Yankees to a 3-2 win over the Astros.	Nathan Eovaldi (7-2), who grew up just outside of Houston in Alvin, Texas, yielded five hits and two runs with six strikeouts in six innings to give him a career-high seven wins. He did it just feet away from fellow Alvin native Nolan Ryan, who sat in the front row just behind home plate.	He's never met the Hall of Famer and didn't realize he was sitting there until his night was almost done. He hopes to meet him before the series is over.	"Growing up for me I connected baseball with him," Eovaldi said. "In our town it was Nolan Ryan everything. You go to any restaurant his memorabilia and everything was there."	New York managed just three hits through the first six innings. The Yankees trailed 2-0 before Carlos Beltran and Garrett Jones had back-to-back singles with one out in the seventh to chase Houston rookie starter Vince Velasquez.	He was replaced by Will Harris (4-1), who was greeted with Young's shot to the Crawford Boxes in left field to put the Yankees on top.	"Will's been fantastic," manager A.J. Hinch said of Harris, who has a 1.03 ERA. "He had one bad pitch in about a month."	Young, who extended his hitting-streak to a career high-tying nine games Friday, has nine homers, 33 RBI and 14 multihit games in 25 career games at Minute Maid Park.	"It definitely doesn't hurt to have some extra support behind your back and a little extra kind of fire up under you when you step to the plate," Young said. "You always have it under you, but anybody I think will agree that when you have 50 people in the stands, it definitely makes a difference."	Young's recent hitting streak has raised his average from .220 to .271.	"He's been really hot and that's why he's playing every day," manager Joe Girardi said.	Carlos Correa had a run-scoring single in the third inning for Houston and an RBI single by Evan Gattis made it 2-0 in the sixth.	Chasen Shreve struck out the side in the seventh for New York for his 13th straight scoreless appearance and Dellin Betances struck out two in 1 1/3 innings for his fifth save. Betances leads all relievers in the majors with 61 strikeouts.	Velasquez, who was making his fourth career start, allowed five hits and two runs in a season-high 6 1/3 innings.	Jose Altuve singled with one out in the sixth inning and stole second base on a strikeout by Luis Valbuena. It was the first time a runner stole a base with Eovaldi on the mound since June 13, 2014, and it was Altuve's American League-leading 21st steal.	Altuve made it 2-0 when he scored on a bloop single by Gattis that dropped in between Stephen Drew, Didi Gregorius and Brett Gardner in shallow center field as both Drew and Gregorius fell to the ground trying to catch it.	Young singled in the fifth, but the Yankees couldn't do anything else in that inning. Chase Headley singled with one out in the sixth before Mark Teixeira grounded into a double play to end the inning.	Jones robbed Colby Rasmus of a hit when he slid on his knees for a catch for the last out of the fourth inning.	Gardner continued his recent hot hitting with a double off the wall in center field with two outs in the third inning, but Velasquez retired Headley to end the threat. Gardner had two hits on Friday night and has three doubles, one triple, four homers and 10 RBI in his last eight games.	Hank Conger hit a one-out double in the third inning and scored on a single by Correa with two outs to make it 1-0.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: CF Jacoby Ellsbury, who has been out since May 19 with a sprained right knee, was traveling to Houston on Friday. Girardi said he'll work out on Saturday and the team would decide whether he's ready to go on a rehabilitation assignment. Girardi said the Yankees need to see him run at 100 percent before he can be sent out.	Astros: Placed right-handed reliever Chad Qualls on the disabled list on Friday with a pinched nerve in his neck. ... RHP Scott Feldman, who had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee on May 29, felt good after throwing off the mound in a bullpen session on Thursday. "Actually he felt better than he expected and that's a positive sign," Hinch said. "He's making strides."	UP NEXT	New York's Masahiro Tanaka (4-3) opposes left-hander Brett Oberholtzer (2-1) when the series continues on Saturday. Tanaka will be pitching on extended rest of five days after tying career highs by allowing seven runs and 10 hits in a loss to Detroit on June 21.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ST. LOUIS --  The St. Louis Cardinals used power to tie the game, and took advantage of a mistake by the Chicago Cubs to win it.	Greg Garcia hit first career home run -- a pinch-hit blast in the eighth inning -- and Peter Bourjos scored the winning run from third on a bases-loaded, no-out, throwing error by Mike Baxter to help the Cardinals to a 3-2, 10-inning win in a battle of NL Central rivals.	It was St. Louis' fourth win in a row and seventh straight at home, and the Cardinals improved to a major-league best 27-7 at home.	With the game tied in the 10th, Jhonny Peralta slapped a routine grounder to second base, where Baxter -- the right fielder -- had come in to play with the bases loaded, giving the Cubs five infielders. Baxter cleanly fielded the ball and had plenty of time, but threw wildly to the third-base side of the plate.	"I threw it away, I didn't make the play," Baxter said. "It's something I'm very capable of doing."	Bourjos began the 10th inning with a double off reliever Justin Grimm (1-2). Kolten Wong followed with a single off the second base bag and Matt Carpenter was walked to load the bases.	Seth Maness (2-0) picked up the win in relief.	Chicago lost its third in a row after a four-game winning streak.	Garcia set up the Cardinals' sixth extra-inning win in nine tries with his homer off Pedro Strop leading off the eighth that tied it at 2. It was the Cardinals' first pinch-hit homer of the season -- from an unlikely source.	"I'm not a power hitter by any means," Garcia said.	Garcia is 3 for 4 as a pinch-hitter since being recalled from Triple-A Memphis on June 19.	"I had a feeling he was going to throw me a fastball," Garcia said. "I put a good swing on it. It was surreal. I can't even put it into words."	St. Louis manager Mike Matheny was confident that Garcia would at least get on base.	"I figured he'd go up there and put a pretty good rip into it," Matheny said. "I didn't expect to see the ball leave (the park). What a great surprise. He's done a nice job whenever we do get him an opportunity."	Kris Bryant gave Chicago a 2-1 lead by driving in Dexter Fowler with a sacrifice fly to center in the seventh off Cardinals starter John Lackey, who gave up two runs on eight hits in seven innings. Fowler started the inning with a double.	"It was a tough one, they put some good at-bats on me," Lackey said. "A lot of deep counts and I had to throw a lot of pitches. But for the most part, I was able to do some good damage control."	Chicago starter Jake Arrieta allowed just one run on three hits over seven innings.	"I got into a groove and was able to hold them off," Arrieta said. "But they did what they do, they fought back. This was a tough one. We were right there."	Randal Grichuk gave St. Louis a 1-0 lead with a run-scoring triple in the second.	Chicago, which had scored just three runs over its previous three games, tied the game in the fourth on a RBI single by Baxter, who had three hits and helped Arrieta with a leap into the stands to snare a flyball by Peralta leading off the sixth.	The Cardinals are 27-18 against the Cubs over the last two-plus seasons.	"This one stings," Chicago first baseman Anthony Rizzo said. "You can't give away a lead there."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: Bryant returned to the starting lineup after being taken out of Thursday's game against the Los Angeles Dodgers with flu-like symptoms after the second inning. Fowler also returned after missing three games with a sore ankle suffered running the bases on Monday.	UP NEXT: Chicago RHP Donn Roach will make his first start of the season against RHP Michael Wacha (9-3, 2.85). Roach is replacing Tsuyoshi Wada, who suffered shoulder tightness in his previous start Monday. Roach was 7-1 with a 2.29 ERA for the Triple-A Iowa Cubs. Wacha began the season 7-0.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

LOS ANGELES --  Taijuan Walker continued to command the strike zone and excel with runners in scoring position, which helps explain why the Seattle Mariners' 22-year-old right-hander has reeled off four straight wins.	Walker pitched seven sharp innings Friday night, leading the Mariners to a 3-1 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Robinson Cano's home run and RBI doubles by Nelson Cruz and Brad Miller.	"I think there's just been a growth period for Taijuan," manager Lloyd McClendon said. "A young pitcher like Walker was going to have some ups and downs and there were going to be some struggles along the way. But we knew that eventually, he would get it and make us all proud."	Walker (6-6) scattered seven hits, struck out six and walked none in his first career start against the Angels, stretching his streak of consecutive innings without allowing a walk to 21 1/3 spanning 87 batters. Opposing batters are 2 for 26 against Walker over his last seven starts.	"I'm just attacking the hitters because I don't want to give them any free passes," said Walker, who gave up his only run on Mike Trout's 19th homer in the first. "Tonight I was just going right after them with the fastball and I was working off that."	Fernando Rodney got three outs for his 15th save in 18 chances and his first since May 29. The right-hander, who set a franchise record last season with 48, got his first save opportunity since being demoted from the closer role.	Carson Smith, who had been closing this month, gave up a single to Trout and a walk to Albert Pujols in the eighth before retiring Johnny Giavotella.	"I just thought that in the eighth inning, that was probably the biggest moment of the game," McClendon said. "They had two big monsters coming up, and Smitty had handled them pretty well in the past. So that was the guy I needed in the game at that particular time."	Matt Shoemaker (4-6) allowed two runs and seven hits in six-plus innings, working on six day's rest after getting two extra days to improve his fastball command. The right-hander is 2-6 with a 5.16 ERA in his last 12 starts since opening the season with consecutive road wins over the Mariners and Texas Rangers -- and 0-5 with a 4.82 ERA in his seven home starts.	"With that extra time off, I just worked on a few more things -- just getting my upper half and lower half working better together," Shoemaker said. "When I do that, I can see my pitches better and I felt like we did that tonight. I just had a few bad breaks. But I kind of got my timing back, which was really positive."	The Mariners took a 2-1 lead in the sixth when Austin Jackson led off with an infield single and came all the way around on Cruz's one-out line drive over the head of Pujols at first base and into the right field corner.	Los Angeles mounted a threat in the bottom half when Trout led off with a single and Pujols was hit with a pitch just above the left elbow. Erick Aybar's bunt advanced the runners, but David Freese struck out and Matt Joyce flied out on the next pitch. The Angels have stranded 54 base runners over the last six games, going 4 for 35 with runners in scoring position during that stretch.	The Mariners opened the seventh with singles by Seth Smith against Shoemaker and Miller against Cesar Ramos. Mike Zunino advanced the runners with a sacrifice after Fernando Salas came in from the bullpen, but Shoemaker got Jackson to ground into a double play after an intentional walk to Logan Morrison.	"He throws strikes and has a little bit of an aggressive approach, so you've got to get something up that you can handle," said Mark Trumbo, who grounded into an inning-ending double play in with two on the sixth. "He mixed it up really well, kept the ball down and got a couple of big double plays."	Salas gave up Cano's fourth homer of the season leading off the eighth.	UP NEXT	Mariners: LHP J.A. Happ (3-4) is 0-3 with a 6.08 ERA in his last three starts after five consecutive no-decisions. In three career starts against the Angels, he is 0-3 with a 9.82 ERA.	Angels: RHP Garrett Richards (7-5) has allowed two earned runs in 29 1/3 innings over his last four starts against Seattle and is 2-0 in those games.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- Considering what happened two months ago, Kansas City manager Ned Yost wasn't shocked to hear fans at the Coliseum booing Royals reliever Kelvin Herrera when he came on to pitch the eighth inning.	If anything, Yost was impressed by the jeers -- almost as much as he was with how Herrera handled it.	"Yeah, I kind of expected it. I kind of respect it," Yost said after Kansas City's 5-2 win over the Oakland Athletics on Friday night.	"That's what's fun about this game. But what was cool was it didn't affect Herrera at all. He came in his usual self, banging strikes at 98, 99, 100 mph."	Herrera was one of the main players involved in a series-long fracas between the two teams when they played earlier this season. He was suspended five games after throwing a 100 mph fastball behind Oakland's Brett Lawrie and then pointing to his head while being escorted off the field.	This time around, Herrera didn't come close to anything controversial. He retired all three batters he faced without incident.	"As a player, you've got to try to stay calm," Herrera said. "When things are going fast, that's the time to slow down."	Unlike when these two teams met in April, when there were bench-clearing scuffles in all three games, there were no signs of lingering animosity. A few players from both clubs exchanged hugs and handshakes before the game, and both managers downplayed talk of any carry-over effect.	Instead, the Royals rode the power of Kendrys Morales and Alex Gordon, and got another strong outing from Edinson Volquez.	Morales and Gordon homered while Volquez pitched seven innings to earn his fourth consecutive win.	Pitching against the A's for the first time since 2007, Volquez (8-4) gave up three hits and one run in seven innings. Volquez also reached 1,000 strikeouts for his career when he fanned Lawrie in the sixth.	"I've been in the big leagues a long time, and that's like a goal," Volquez said. "I finally got it."	Sam Fuld had an RBI double for Oakland, which had its five-game win streak snapped.	Greg Holland retired two batters for his 15th save.	It was these teams' first meeting since that wild series in April.	Lawrie was at the center of much of it when the teams played in Kansas City. His hard slide into second base knocked Royals shortstop Alcides Escobar out of the first game. Two days later, Herrera was ejected after throwing the 100 mph fastball behind Lawrie.	There were no sparks this time around, although Franklin Morales hit Oakland catcher Stephen Vogt on the right wrist with a pitch in the ninth.	"Fortunately it's not broken," Vogt said after X-rays came back negative. "It got me in the wrist and the hand. Obviously, it was painful, but I'll be OK."	Vogt and Morales were teammates in winter ball.	"I doubt he would do that (intentionally). I know him really well," Vogt said.	"You have to ask them" about any lingering bitterness, A's manager Bob Melvin said curtly, referring to the Royals. "They hit our guy."	Beyond that, there was nothing to suggest there was any animosity left between the teams. Oakland slugger Billy Butler hugged former teammate Eric Hosmer behind home plate during batting practice, and both managers were reluctant to even discuss the incident.	"Nobody on my team has even mentioned it or thought about it, and I doubt very seriously anybody over there has," Yost said before the game. "There's been a lot of time since that series and a lot of water under the bridge."	Morales homered off A's starter Jesse Hahn in the second, his ninth of the season.	Lorenzo Cain's two-out single in the third made it 2-0, and Hosmer followed with an infield single to drive in Escobar. Oakland first baseman Ike Davis fielded Hosmer's grounder but made a botched flip to Hahn (5-6) covering first base for an error, allowing Cain to score from second.	Fuld doubled in Marcus Semien in the third. Ben Zobrist added an RBI double for Oakland off Morales in the ninth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals: Cain was back in the lineup after sitting out Wednesday's game in Seattle with a sore hamstring. ... LHP Jason Vargas (flexor strain) is scheduled to throw on the side again and "continues to make progress," according to Yost.	UP NEXT	Royals: RHP Chris Young (6-3) starts the middle game of the series and is coming off his worst outing of the season, when he gave up seven runs in 4⅔ innings against Boston.	Athletics: LHP Scott Kazmir (4-4) has a 1.27 ERA in six starts at the Coliseum this season, the lowest mark at home in the majors.	The Associated Press contributed to this report.

SAN DIEGO --  Pat Murphy has been looking for this all-around effort from the San Diego Padres since he was named interim manager.	Tyson Ross overcame control problems to combine with three relievers on a two-hitter and the offense was productive enough, lifting the Padres to a 4-2 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks on	Ross (5-7) got help from relievers Brandon Maurer, Joaquin Benoit and Craig Kimbrel, who combined to allow just one walk in the final three innings and give San Diego just its fourth win in 10 games since Murphy took over June 16.	"We're not on all cylinders by any stretch of the imagination but real pleased because it was an overall great game," Murphy said.	Kemp's sacrifice fly in the sixth broke a 2-all tie. Cory Spangenberg scored just ahead of the throw by center fielder A.J. Pollock.	Kemp batted leadoff for the third straight game and had a double and picked up his 13th RBI in his last 19 games. Spangenberg had three singles, stole two bases and scored twice.	"When you are not going as well as you want you have to find ways to win," Spangenberg said. "I think we did a great job of that tonight."	Ross (5-7) allowed just two hits and struck out seven in six innings. But the right-hander tied his season high with five walks, including walking the bases loaded in the third that led to the Diamondbacks' two runs.	But Ross settled down after the third and combined with the relievers to retire 13 of the final 14 batters. Kimbrel worked the ninth inning for his 19th save in 20 chances.	"I was pleased that Tyson showed some mental toughness to get through some tough situations," Murphy said.	The Diamondbacks, who have lost three of four, committed three errors that led to one unearned run.	"We are usually tighter than that," Arizona manager Chip Hale said.  "They made it happen. They pushed the envelope and they did a nice job and it worked."	Ross walked all five batters in the first three innings, including the third when issued a leadoff walk, struck out two batters, then walked consecutive batters to load the bases for Paul Goldschmidt.	Goldschmidt grounded a full-count pitch into the center field to drive in two runs as Arizona took a 2-1 lead.	Ross, who increased his season walks total to a major league-high 48, won consecutive starts for the first time this season.	Robbie Ray (2-3) allowed three runs -- two earned -- on five hits in six innings.	Spangenberg led off the third with a single, was sacrificed to second, stole third base and scored when catcher Wellington Castillo's throw went into left field.	Yonder Alonso had an RBI double in the first after Derek Norris reached on Goldschmidt's fielding error.	HOME RUN DROUGHT	Ross has not allowed a home run in his last 11 starts, a stretch of 72 innings, the longest streak this season in the majors. Ross has allowed only three homers all season, the last on April 28.	SHOW ME SOME PADRES	In 11 games against San Diego, Goldschmidt is batting .351 with three home runs and 11 RBI.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: RHP Archie Bradley (right shoulder tendinitis) will visit orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews to have his right shoulder examined after he complained of discomfort after his rehab start on Wednesday.	Padres: C Tim Federowicz, out since right knee surgery in March, is hoping to start a rehab next week.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: Jeremy Hellickson (5-4) has gone 4-1 in his last seven starts.	Padres: RHP Andrew Cashner (2-9, 4.35 ERA) will look to avoid becoming the majors' second 10-game loser. Cashner has allowed 62 runs in 89 innings -- but only 43 earned runs.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Carlos Gonzalez spent time in the batting cage the past few days. No wonder he had so much fun returning to the lineup.	Gonzalez matched his career high with five hits, Nolan Arenado hit a pair of home runs and had four RBI, and the Colorado Rockies held on to beat the San Francisco Giants 8-6 on Friday night.	"It was one of those nights whenever I made contact, it was actually a hit," Gonzalez said. "I had a couple that weren't hit hard enough, but they found holes. It was fun to hit tonight."	Ben Paulsen had three hits and added a two-run single for the Rockies, who won their fifth in six games after losing eight of nine.	Tim Hudson (5-7) took a shutout into the sixth inning, but Arenado's 21st home run ended it.	"It was a weird night," Hudson said. "I felt like we were one pitch away from shutting them out and then they popped us for three runs there."	Arenado has already set a single-season career high with 64 RBI.	"I'm just trying to hit the ball hard," Arenado said. "Lately, they have been going out for some reason. I don't have an answer for that."	Chad Bettis (4-2) won his second start despite giving up his fourth home run in his past 17 1/3 innings. He did not give up a homer in his first 38 1/3 innings. Bettis allowed three runs and six hits over six innings, and walked two and struck out three.	Andrew Susac homered and Brandon Belt and Brandon Crawford each drove in a run for the Giants, who have lost three of their last five.	The Giants scored three times in the ninth against Tommy Kahnle to make things interesting. Three walks, a passed ball and RBI singles by Gregor Blanco and Joe Panik cut the deficit to two runs before Kahnle struck out Matt Duffy and Buster Posey, both on full counts.	"All you can ask is to bring the winning run to the plate," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "We had the right guys up, too. It just didn't happen."	Gonzalez, who was resting a sore hand, doubled in a run in the seventh against Javier Lopez, who replaced Hudson and Paulsen singled home two runs. Gonzalez, a home run shy of the cycle, recorded his 20th career game of at least four hits.	"It ended the way we wanted it to end," Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. "It wasn't exactly how we drew it up. We would have liked to coast to the end, but I'm not surprised they made a run."	Arenado (13), Troy Tulowitzki (10) and Charlie Blackmon (10) each extended hitting streaks, the three longest active in the NL. Tulowitzki has hit safely in 22 of 23 games and has reached base in each of his last 25 games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rockies: Left-hander Jorge De La Rosa, who left Thursday night's game with a cut on his left middle finger, said he should make his next start. "His finger looks a lot better than it did 24 hours ago," Weiss said. "The next few days will tell." ... Gonzalez (mild hand sprain) made his first start since Sunday.	Giants: Outfielder Angel Pagan bruised his left knee running into the outfield wall. He was not available for the game and was scheduled for an MRI. ... Left-hander Jeremy Affeldt went on the disabled list with a left shoulder sprain. ... Right-hander Matt Cain threw his final rehab start and will likely take his spot in the rotation next week.	UP NEXT:	Rockies: Left-hander Chris Rusin (3-2, 5.03) threw seven shutout innings last year in his only career start against the Giants. He's 4-7 with a 5.10 ERA in 19 games on the road.	Giants: Right-hander Tim Lincecum (7-4, 3.86) is coming off the shortest outing of his career, 1 1/3 innings against the Los Angeles Dodgers last Sunday. He's 11-10 with a 3.96 ERA in 29 starts against the Rockies.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

TORONTO --  Another scoreless outing by Yovani Gallardo put an emphatic end to the Texas Rangers' longest losing streak of the season	Gallardo extended his scoreless streak to a career-high 23 innings by pitching three-hit ball into the ninth Saturday, and the Rangers snapped a six-game skid with a 4-0 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays.	"Just a masterful job by Yovani today," Rangers manager Jeff Banister said.	Mitch Moreland, Robinson Chirinos and Rougned Odor all hit solo home runs for the Rangers, who won for the first time since beating the White Sox on June 19.	Gallardo (7-6) fell two-outs shy of his first shutout and first complete game since a 1-0 win over Atlanta while pitching for Milwaukee on April 5, 2011.	"It was a great win for us, period," Gallardo said. "Obviously the last week we haven't played the way we wanted to."	The right-hander won his fourth straight decision and improved to 2-0 with a 0.54 ERA in five June starts. Gallardo last allowed a run in the eighth inning of a June 10 outing at Oakland, four starts ago.	It's the longest scoreless streak by a Rangers pitcher since Martin Perez worked 26 scoreless innings in April, 2014.	The Blue Jays came in having scored an major league-high 417 runs but couldn't get anything going against Gallardo.	"The breaking ball was a little sharper today than it has been," Banister said. "Against a group of guys like this ball club, you need that."	Jose Bautista drew a two out walk in the first but was left stranded. Toronto didn't get its first hit until Edwin Encarnacion's two-out single in the fourth. Dioner Navarro followed with a strikeout, the first of 10 consecutive outs. The streak ended when Russell Martin drew a leadoff walk in the eighth, but Chris Colabello grounded into a double play on Gallardo's next pitch.	"He was picking us apart pretty good," Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said of Gallardo.	Toronto was blanked for the second time this season. Washington's Ryan Zimmermann pitched eight scoreless innings to beat the Blue Jays in the first game of a doubleheader on June 2, with Drew Storen saving the 2-0 win.	Gallardo left after Josh Donaldson's one-out single in the ninth. Shawn Tolleson came on and got Bautista to ground into a game-ending double play.	Promoted from, Triple-A Buffalo to make his major league debut, Blue Jays left-hander Matt Boyd (0-1) allowed four runs and nine hits, including three homers, in 6 2/3 innings.	"I wasn't nervous, I was excited," Boyd said. "It's definitely something to build on."	Odor opened the scoring with a sacrifice fly in the second and Moreland made it 2-0 with a leadoff drive in the fourth.	Chirinos hit a leadoff homer in the fifth and Odor did the same in the seventh.	SANTANA ABANDONS COMEBACK	Two-time Cy Young award winner Johan Santana has abandoned his comeback bid with the Blue Jays. Santana signed a minor league deal with Toronto in February but never appeared in a game at any level. Santana last pitched in the majors in 2012	PRINCE OF HITS	Prince Fielder singled in his first two at bats for his ML-leading 32nd multihit game.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: RHP Aaron Sanchez (strained back muscle) is scheduled to throw bullpen sessions next Wednesday and Saturday at Toronto's spring training facility in Dunedin, Florida, manager John Gibbons said. It will be the first time Sanchez has thrown from a mound since June 5. Sanchez (5-4, 3.55) is expected back by mid-July.	UP NEXT	Rangers: RHP Chi Chi Gonzalez (2-2, 2.27 ERA) is winless in his past three starts after winning the first two outings of his career. Gonzalez has a 0.56 ERA in two road starts.	Blue Jays: RHP Drew Hutchison (7-1, 5.33) seeks to win his fourth straight decision. He's 5-1 with a 2.38 ERA in seven home starts.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MILWAUKEE --  Torii Hunter celebrated his 1,300th game as a Minnesota Twin in style.	Hunter homered twice and doubled, Eduardo Escobar hit a three-run homer and the Twins beat the Milwaukee Brewers 5-2 Saturday.	Kyle Gibson (5-6) allowed two runs and six hits in 6 2/3 innings. He had lost a career-worst three straight decisions after starting June with a no-decision in the Twins' 10-5 loss to Milwaukee at Target Field.	"How do you get 1,300 and you're only 29?" Hunter said with a big laugh. "In dog years, yes."	"It's great, man, to have 1,300 games with the Minnesota Twins," the 39-year-old right fielder said. "That's where it all started, back where I grew up and learned how to be a man and learned how to be a baseball player. I'm definitely honored."	Hunter appeared in made his major league debut as a pinch-runner in one game on Aug. 22, 1997. He played in six games in 1998 and became a regular in 1999 until he left after the 2007 season.	Hunter is back with Minnesota after two years with Detroit and Saturday was his 66th game of this season.	According to Twins manager Paul Molitor, Hunter has been getting teased about his age and power.	"They've been joking each other about who doesn't have pop these days," Molitor said. "And, he kind of took care of that a little bit."	What Hunter and Escobar also took care of was ensuring the win that helped Gibson snap his losing streak.	Hunter went hitless in Friday night's 10-4 loss to the Brewers, but carried what he described as good at bats into Saturday's game.	"Yesterday, I felt good," he said. "I was 0 for 4, but I swung the bat pretty well. I took the positive from that and just carried it over to today. I got lucky. I just happened to hit the ball where nobody was at which was out of the park."	Brewers manager Craig Counsell discredited any talk about Hunter slowing down.	"That's not at player at the end of his career," Counsell said. "He's still a threat. He's still dangerous."	Casey Fien pitched the eighth and Glenn Perkins picked up his 24th save in as many chances with a perfect ninth.	Hunter and Escobar gave Gibson more support than the three runs he had gotten during his losing streak. Escobar hit a three-run homer in the fifth after Hunter doubled and Chris Herrmann walked.	Hunter homered in the sixth off Matt Garza (4-10) and in the ninth against Corey Knebel.	"I thought Garza was good today," Hunter said. "He just had one mistake. It's a three-run homer. We were able to capitalize on that mistake."	Garza had lost his previous two starts, giving up a total of 26 hits and 16 runs. Against the Twins, he allowed four runs and five hits in six innings.	Gibson retired 10 of the first 11 batters before Carlos Gomez lined a double in the fourth and scored on Adam Lind's single.	Pinch-hitter Ryan Braun had a two-out, RBI single in the seventh that ended Gibson's start.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Twins: OF Aaron Hicks, sidelined since June 13 with a right forearm strain, went 0 for 4 with two strikeouts Friday night for Triple-A Rochester in a rehab assignment.	Brewers: LF Khris Davis, on the 15-day DL with a torn meniscus in his right knee, appears to be improving enough that Counsell said he could head out for a rehab assignment next week.	UP NEXT	Twins: LHP Tommy Milone (4-1) looks to win his third straight start as he goes Sunday against the Brewers.	Brewers: RHP Mike Fiers (3-7) makes his second start of the season against Minnesota. He is 1-1 with an 1.88 ERA in three career starts against the Twins, who beat him 2-0 on June 7 at Target Field.	DOZIER LOVES MILLER PARK	Brian Dozier has hit safely in all nine career games at Miller Park, going .436 (17 for 39).	CHALLENGE PLAY	The Brewers challenged their 19th play of the season in the sixth inning after Trevor Plouffe was rule safe at first. After a review of 2:12, the play was overturned and Plouffe was ruled out. The Brewers are 13-8 in challenges this year.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  With his team nearing its 43rd win of the season to tie Houston for the most in the AL, Kansas City manager Ned Yost finally relaxed and allowed himself to enjoy the moment.	The Royals are rolling again and the normally stoic Yost broke character to take it in.	Chris Young bounced back from his worst start of the year to pitch six innings and Kansas City beat the Oakland Athletics 3-2 Saturday to move a season-high 15 games over .500.	"I was sitting there thinking about that in the ninth inning, this would be a chance to get our high-water mark to 15 over," Yost said following the Royals' third consecutive win. "If I would say I'm not excited about being 15 over, I'd be lying. It's great, but we want to continue to keep going, keep going, keep going."	Kendrys Morales hit a two-run single in the sixth off Scott Kazmir (4-5) that erased a 2-1 deficit. The Royals won for the fourth time in five games on their road trip.	Young (7-3) allowed four hits and two runs. He walked one and struck out four.	That was in stark contrast to Young's previous start against Boston when he was tagged for seven runs in 4 2/3 innings.	"He did a great job of changing eye level," Yost said. "He'd get them looking up then pitch down. He'd get them looking down, then he'd pitch up. He moved the ball in and he'd move the ball out. He just did a great job of executing pitches."	Ryan Madson and Wade Davis pitched one inning apiece, and Greg Holland worked the ninth for his 16th save.	Sam Fuld doubled for the A's, who were wearing throwback uniforms from 1965 when the franchise was in Kansas City. Oakland has lost two straight after a season-high, five-game winning streak.	Oakland had two on with no outs in the eighth but failed to score. Stephen Vogt struck out looking against Davis after getting ahead in the count 3-0, and Ben Zobrist hit into a 1-6-3 double play.	"Once they get to the seventh, they feel like they have a good chance with the lead," A's manager Bob Melvin said of the Royals. "We had an opportunity. We just didn't get a big hit there."	For the second consecutive game these two bitter rivals played without incident. When they played in Kansas City in April, all three games were marred by bench-clearing dustups.	The Royals trailed 2-1 in the sixth before stringing together a walk and two hits. Lorenzo Cain and Hosmer also pulled off a double steal before Morales singled.	Young, who made a throwing error that led to Oakland's first run, won for the third time in four starts.	Fuld doubled leading off the first, alertly stole third against the Royals shifted defense and scored when Young's throw to third sailed wildly into foul territory.	Omar Infante doubled in the third, moved up on a balk by Kazmir and scored on a sacrifice fly by Moustakas.	A two-out throwing error by shortstop Alcides Escobar in the fifth led to an unearned run for the A's in the fifth.	Kazmir owned the lowest home ERA in the majors going into the game, but gave up three runs and seven hits in seven innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals: RHP Yordano Ventura allowed three runs in four innings during his first rehab start for Triple-A Omaha. He has been out since June 13 with ulnar neuritis.	Athletics: OF Billy Burns (hip flexor) rested for a second straight day, but should be available for the series finale. ... Switch-pitcher Pat Venditte (strained right shoulder) played catch with his right arm before the game and reported no pain. ... Stephen Vogt was Oakland's DH a day after getting hit in the right wrist by a pitch from Franklin Morales.	UP NEXT	Royals: RHP Jeremy Guthrie (5-5) needs two strikeouts to reach 1,000 for his career. Teammate Edinson Volquez reached the milestone Friday.	Athletics: RHP Jesse Chavez (4-6) seeks his third consecutive win. He has never won more than two in a row.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PITTSBURGH --  Andrew McCutchen's left elbow is bruised, but not busted after getting hit by a pitch on Saturday. Still, the star center fielder for the Pirates is growing tired of becoming a target whenever he steps into the batter's box.	"Maybe I need to dropkick a pitcher," McCutchen said. "Maybe that will scare them into not throwing at me."	The 2013 NL MVP was kidding. Besides, his teammates had his back. Starling Marte got three hits and scored three times after McCutchen's departure, helping Pittsburgh to an 8-4 victory over the Atlanta Braves.	Pittsburgh ripped off five runs in the first inning after McCutchen was plunked by a 92 mph fastball from Julio Teheran, an emphatic response after McCutchen was hit for the eighth time this season and the second time in as many nights.	"I'm not the only one ticked off," McCutchen said. "We're all ticked off. It's not just me. It's anyone that gets hit and comes out of the game. That's something we don't like."	Jordy Mercer, Francisco Cervelli and Pedro Alvarez each drove in two runs for Pittsburgh. Charlie Morton (6-1) pitched into the seventh to bounce back from a rough start in Washington last weekend.	Teheran (5-4) gave up six runs in six innings, unraveling briefly after tagging McCutchen.	"I didn't know that my two-seamer was moving that much so it was the first one I threw in the game," Teheran said. "I feel bad that I hit him. It's part of the game and you don't want that to affect you."	McCutchen doesn't wear an elbow pad because of the way it inhibits his swing. He was doubled over for several moments after getting hit for the 48th time in his career.	When the numbness persisted, he was helped off by trainers. X-rays were negative, but he is not certain if he will be able to start the series finale on Sunday.	The play seemed to get Pittsburgh's attention. Marte singled home Neil Walker to give the Pirates the lead, and they were just getting started. Alvarez followed with a two-run double, Cervelli had an RBI single and Mercer drove in another run with a crisp single up the middle.	"I think it was a real nice push for our guys to answer in that fashion," Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said.	Morton, who was knocked around for nine runs in less than an inning by the Nationals in his previous start, was far crisper this time out.	Staked to a sizable lead, Morton hit Andrelton Simmons in the foot in the second inning. Home plate umpire John Tumpane issued a warning to both dugouts. Things settled down quickly.	Nick Markakis had an RBI single for Atlanta in the third, but Marte scored on a delayed double steal -- helped by a botched throw home from first baseman Joey Terdoslavich -- to make it 6-1. It was the first steal of home by the Pirates since McCutchen did it against the Chicago Cubs on July 5, 2013.	"You've got to be bold and aggressive," Hurdle said. "I don't believe in a safety break."	Morton's control abandoned him in the seventh. Two singles and a walk loaded the bases with no outs, and Jace Peterson doubled to get Atlanta within 6-4, but the Braves would get no closer.	PAINFUL NIGHT	Williams Perez expected some discomfort the day after the rookie Atlanta pitcher took a liner off his left foot in the fifth inning on Friday night. X-rays revealed no fractures, and Perez put on a walking boot as a precaution. The boot helped. It just didn't prepare Perez for what awaited when he opened his eyes on Saturday.	"It was worse than I thought it was going to be," Perez said.	While Perez felt he "dodged a bullet," he couldn't avoid some unwanted time off. The Braves placed him on the 15-day DL and called up 27-year-old rookie reliever Jake Brigham from Triple-A Gwinnett. Manager Fredi Gonzalez isn't sure Perez needs the entire 15 days to heal from the bone bruise, but didn't want the Braves to be short a man for an extended period. Gonzalez isn't sure who will take Perez's spot in the rotation when it comes up again Thursday against Washington.	UP NEXT	The series wraps up Sunday when Atlanta's Alex Wood (4-5, 3.44 ERA) faces Jeff Locke (4-3, 4.73 ERA). Wood has lost three straight decisions, including a 3-0 defeat against the Pirates on June 7. The Braves have knocked around Locke at times. The left-hander is 1-1 with a 6.08 ERA in five starts against Atlanta. The lone victory was a 2-1 triumph on Oct. 1, 2012, that was Locke's first major league victory.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Andrew Susac usually takes a back seat to Buster Posey. For at least one day, they shared the spotlight.	Posey drove in two runs, and Susac had a three-run double in the seventh inning to rally the San Francisco Giants to a 7-5 victory over the Colorado Rockies on Saturday.	The Rockies intentionally walked Posey to load the bases for Susac, who has an eight-game hitting streak.	"When I saw the base open, I knew they would do it," Susac said. "I didn't change my approach. I was able to get it past them."	Matt Duffy added three hits, including a home run, for the Giants, who won three games in a homestand for the first time since sweeping the Los Angeles Dodgers on May 19-21.	"Andrew's play has picked up. He's earned this," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "The more he plays, the more comfortable he's getting. He came through with the big hit when we needed it."	Nolan Arenado extended his hitting streak to 14 games with an RBI double and Wilin Rosario added two hits and drove in a run for the Rockies, who had won five of their previous six games.	"We gave them a couple of extra outs," Rockies manager Walt Weiss said.	George Kontos (2-0) pitched a scoreless seventh for the win. Santiago Casilla pitched the ninth for his 20th save.	Rafael Betancourt (2-3), making his second appearance since being activated from the disabled list, gave up Susac's hit.	"He put a good swing on the ball and hit it in the right place," Betancourt said. "There was nothing I could about it."	Giants starter Tim Lincecum had a rough outing. He lasted 1 2/3 innings, giving up three runs and four hits. He left the game in the top of the second inning after he was hit just above his right elbow by D.J. LeMahieu's line drive.	"He got hit pretty good," Bochy said. "He might need a break."	Lincecum walked two and struck out one while failing to get out of the second inning for the second straight start.	Yusemeiro Petit took over for Lincecum and went 4 1/3 innings. He gave up two runs and three hits.	Chris Rusin gave up five runs -- two earned -- and 10 hits for the Rockies. He walked one, struck out four and also drove in a run.	"Rus did a great job," Weiss said. "He commanded his pitches and gave us length."	Troy Tulowitzki and Charlie Blackmon each drove in a run and extended their hitting streaks to 11 games.	TRAINER'S TABLE	Rockies: 1B Justin Morneau continues to rehab a neck injury, with no timetable for his return. ... LHP Ken Roberts (left elbow inflammation), optioned to Triple-A Albuquerque on June 19, made one appearance for the Isotopes and has not pitched in a week.	Giants: RHP Jake Peavy (back strain) made his final rehab start Friday night, surviving a 5-run first inning to get through six innings. "I'm glad he got out of the first inning," Bochy said. "We needed him to get those innings under his belt. When he gets here, we'll see how he feels."	UP NEXT	Rockies: RHP Kyle Kendrick (3-9, 5.96) won his last outing, at home. He's 2-5 with a 5.33 ERA in eight road starts and is 2/3 with a 4.85 ERA in nine games, three starts, against the Giants.	Giants: LHP Madison Bumgarner (7-4, 3.04) has a 1.93 ERA over his past three games, all losses. The Giants have scored two runs combined in those starts. Bumgarner is 5-1 with a 2.11 ERA in nine home starts against the Rockies.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

HOUSTON --  The New York Yankees didn't get discouraged after they blew an early six-run lead on Saturday against the Houston Astros.	They just put their heads down and got back to work.	Brian McCann hit a grand slam and Chris Young homered to give New York an early lead, and Mark Teixeira had a tiebreaking two-run double in the eighth after the Yankees squandered that cushion in a 9-6 win.	"It was one of those old-fashioned slugfests," Teixeira said. "Whoever was going to get the big hit at the end of the game was going to win, and we did."	McCann's slam came in the first. A two-run shot by Young, a Houston native, that extended his hitting streak to a career-high 10 games, in the second off Houston starter Brett Oberholtzer put the Yankees up 6-0.	Oberholtzer was ejected with one out in the second inning for throwing at Alex Rodriguez and the Astros got going on offense after that. Chris Carter and George Springer each drove in a run in the second before Carter homered in the fourth to cut it to 6-3.	Oberholtzer was optioned to Triple-A Fresno after the game.	Both managers were unhappy with Oberholtzer's actions.	"I think it's a kid getting frustrated," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "I definitely think he threw at Alex. You don't want to see that. We've seen it before and you just move on."	When asked if Oberholtzer was sent down because of the incident, Houston manager A.J. Hinch said it played a role in the move, but that they also needed another arm in the bullpen for Sunday's game.	"We don't operate that way, we won't operate that way," Hinch said. "It's not a reflection of anybody around here, including Obie."	Oberholtzer denied intentionally throwing at Rodriguez and thinks the situation escalated because of his superstar status.	Rookie Carlos Correa hit a two-run homer in the fifth and Jose Altuve connected on the next at-bat to tie it up.	Brett Gardner walked to start the eighth before Young reached on a fielder's choice and Gardner advanced to second on an error by Altuve. Houston challenged the call at second, but it was upheld. Teixeira then doubled off Pat Neshek (3-1) with one out in the inning to put New York back on top.	Chasen Shreve (5-1) got the last two outs of the seventh inning for the win and Dellin Betances threw a scoreless ninth for his sixth save.	Chase Headley's solo homer off Tony Sipp in the ninth pushed the lead to 9-6.	Correa, the top pick in the 2012 draft, had three hits and finished a triple shy of the cycle.	Masahiro Tanaka had another tough start after tying career highs in hits (10) and runs (seven) and allowing a personal-worst three home runs in his last start. On Saturday, he again gave up three homers while yielding seven hits and six runs in five innings.	"I just look at it as a rough start and we've got to iron it out," Girardi said. "We'll get it ironed out. We know what he's capable of doing."	Springer walked with no outs in the fifth before Correa hit his fifth homer to get Houston to 6-5.	Altuve connected off Tanaka two pitches later, launching an 84 mph slider into the Crawford Boxes in left field to tie it up.	Oberholtzer's day quickly went wrong. Gardner hit a leadoff double before consecutive walks by Young and Rodriguez loaded the bases. McCann's one-out shot landed in the second deck in right field to make it 4-0.	Gardner doubled with one out in the second before Young's 10th homer pushed the lead to 6-0.	Oberholtzer's next pitch was inside on Rodriguez on and A-Rod jumped out of the way to avoid being hit. Oberholtzer was immediately ejected as Rodriguez stood at the plate with his hand on his left hip and Girardi held back pitcher CC Sabathia as he came out of the dugout yelling at Oberholtzer and both dugouts were warned.	Oberholtzer stomped to the dugout where he threw his glove against the wall and knocked over some paper cups in anger. He allowed four hits, six runs and walked three in his shortest start of the season.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: RHP Scott Feldman, who had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee on May 29, faced a couple of hitters throwing off the mound on Saturday and manager A.J. Hinch said he looked good. Hinch said he'll do a more aggressive live bullpen session in a couple of days. ... OF Colby Rasmus was scratched from the lineup with a skin infection, but Hinch said he should return Sunday.	Yankees: CF Jacoby Ellsbury, out since May 19 with a sprained right knee, was in Houston on Saturday to work out so the team can gauge where's he's at in his recovery. Girardi said he'll also work out on Sunday before they decide if he's ready for a rehabilitation assignment.	UP NEXT	New York's Michael Pineda (8-4) looks to bounce back after struggling in his last start when he opposes Collin McHugh (8-3) in the finale of the series. Pineda allowed 11 hits and eight runs -- both career highs -- in a loss to Philadelphia on Monday. McHugh has won two in a row.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

NEW YORK -- Terry Collins was just happy the game ended. With a win in their pocket, the New York Mets could finally get to prized prospect Steven Matz's debut.	Lucas Duda drove in the winning run on the Cincinnati Reds' second bungled infield chance in the 13th inning, lifting the Mets to a 2-1 victory Sunday in the completion of a game suspended by rain a day earlier.	Curtis Granderson homered for New York and Brandon Phillips had an RBI double for the Reds on Saturday before the game was cut short after six innings with the score tied 1-all.	"We won the game. That's the only good thing that happened, besides the pitching," the Mets' manager said about 24 hours after the game started at 4:12 p.m. Saturday.	Granderson had a big hit in the 13th on Sunday, a single to right field off Nate Adcock (0-1) after Dilson Herrera drew a leadoff walk. Herrera raced to third base, and the Reds brought their infield in.	Eugenio Suarez, who was pinch-hitting in the top half when Ivan DeJesus Jr. was caught stealing to end the inning, could not handle Ruben Tejada's grounder to shortstop for an error that loaded the bases.	Cincinnati then brought in left fielder Skip Schumaker to form a five-man infield.	Duda hit a high chopper to first baseman Joey Votto, who leaped and initially snagged the ball before it fell out of his glove, giving him no play. Herrera slid home to give the Mets their third straight victory following a seven-game skid.	New York has managed only two runs in each of the wins -- and totaled all of 15 in its past 10 games. Mets pitchers, however, have yielded just two runs in the last 33 innings.	"That game didn't look like it was going to be won by a solo home run," Reds manager Bryan Price said. "It was going to need something like that, a walk or a mistake, that was going to lead to a win."	Bobby Parnell (1-0) pitched an inning in his sixth appearance since returning from Tommy John surgery. He earned his first win since June 6, 2013.	Reds slugger Todd Frazier fouled out with the bases loaded in the seventh, and both struggling lineups had chances to score in the late innings. Gold Glove center fielder Juan Lagares robbed Cincinnati's Jay Bruce of a homer in the eighth, and two fantastic plays by Schumaker in the seventh thwarted the Mets.	"We wouldn't have been in that situation to still be in the game in those late innings had Shu hadn't made those great plays in the seventh inning," Price said.	New York failed to take advantage of a two-base error by Votto in the 11th and went 0 for 15 with runners in scoring position for the game. The Reds left 12 on base.	Sunday's regularly scheduled game featured the heralded debut of Matz, who grew up about an hour from Citi Field on Long Island. He was called up as New York's 26th player on the roster.	Matz is the latest -- and perhaps last -- in a stellar crop of young pitchers to arrive with the Mets recently. The ace of the group, Matt Harvey, gave up a run over six solid innings in the rain Saturday night before being lifted for a pinch-hitter.	After using five relievers Sunday, Collins hoped he could get some distance from the rookie, but said: "The game will dictate how much latitude he has. Hopefully he pitches well."	Carlos Torres was announced as the Mets' first reliever Saturday, but the game was suspended before he took the mound.	When the game restarted, 20 minutes after the planned time because of more early rain in New York, the official scorer announced Reds rookie Michael Lorenzen's line -- he was lifted in the sixth inning Saturday night.	The Reds loaded the bases in the seventh, but Hansel Robles got Frazier to foul out.	Lorenzen matched Harvey most of the way Saturday and received relief help from Manny Parra, who retired Granderson on a 3-1 pitch with the bases loaded to end the sixth.	With the rain getting heavier, umpires stopped play and signaled for the tarp. The game was called following a 53-minute delay.	Phillips' double gave him a hit in all 31 road games he's played against the Mets.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: OF Jason Bourgeois (broken bone in left shoulder) was activated from the 60-day disabled list and added to the roster as the 26th man for the originally scheduled game. To make room on the 40-man roster, the Reds transferred RHP Jon Moscot to the 60-day DL.	Mets: INF Daniel Murphy (strained left quadriceps) went 1 for 3 and played five innings at third base in a rehab game with Class A St. Lucie. He could be back with the Mets on Tuesday.	UP NEXT	Reds: RHP Josh Smith made his second major league start in the series finale.	Mets: Matz was 7-4 with a 2.19 ERA and 94 strikeouts in 90 1/3 innings for Triple-A Las Vegas.	---	AP Baseball Writer Mike Fitzpatrick contributed to this report.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

MIAMI --  Tom Koehler gave the Miami Marlins a big lift in their first game since Giancarlo Stanton was sidelined by a hand injury.	Koehler pitched seven innings, and Miami stopped a five-game slide with a 3-2 victory over Clayton Kershaw and the Los Angeles Dodgers on Saturday	"In lieu of what happened last night this team could have came in today and been very deflated after the injury to `G' and you couldn't have had a better person to take the ball in an outing like this in Tom Koehler," Marlins manager Dan Jennings said.	Christian Yelich tied a career high with four hits for the Marlins, who snapped a five-game losing streak. Koehler (6-4) allowed two runs and six hits.	Stanton broke his left hand during Friday night's 7-1 loss to Los Angeles. The slugger is expected to miss four to six weeks.	"To get a win on a day where we lose arguably the front-runner for the MVP is big and it shows the character of the guys and hopefully it's a momentum-builder," Koehler said.	Kershaw (5-6) allowed three runs, one earned, and seven hits in seven innings. The left-hander struck out nine and walked none.	"You really can't ask Clayton to pitch a whole lot better," Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said. "He gives up one earned run and goes seven innings. We weren't able to put any runs on the board to overcome our mistakes."	Miami scored each of its runs without an RBI. Dodgers outfielders Andre Ethier and Joc Pederson each committed a run-scoring error, and a wild pitch by Kershaw allowed another run to come home.	"It's being opportunistic and when those situations present themselves, if you're doing things the right way and execute, then sometimes the breaks go your way," Jennings said.	A day after striking out a season-high 16 times, the Marlins struck out 12 times, but found a way to score more than one run for the first time in four games. They had just eight runs during their losing streak.	Carter Capps pitched the eighth and A.J. Ramos got three outs for his 10th save in 13 chances.	Justin Turner hit his 11th homer in the first for Los Angeles, but the Marlins got two runs in the bottom half.	Yelich singled and scored on a throwing error by right fielder Ethier. Adeiny Hechavarria also singled and came around to score on a wild pitch.	"A couple of balls that weren't hit that hard," Kershaw said. "The wild pitch ... I threw that one really short and gave up the second run, which you never want to do."	J.T. Realmuto doubled and scored in the second on a dropped fly ball by Pederson, pushing the Marlins' lead to 3-1.	"I messed up and I lost the game for us," Pederson said.	Adrian Gonzalez had an RBI single in the fourth for Los Angeles, but the inning ended on an impressive double play turned by Hechavarria and Dee Gordon.	"The double play that was turned was phenomenal," Jennings said. "They find a way it seems every game to come up with something huge to help us get out of a situation that could turn bad."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: RF Yasiel Puig (callus) is expected to return to the starting lineup for Sunday's series finale for the first time in five games. Puig entered in the seventh inning as a pinch hitter and finished the game. ... LHP Paco Rodriguez (elbow tendinitis) was expected to return to the team on Monday, but will miss the next eight to 10 weeks following a setback, which will require surgery.	NEXT UP	Dodgers: RHP Zack Greinke (5-2, 1.70 ERA) will take his major league-leading 1.70 ERA to the mound on Sunday. He is 3-0 with a 3.51 ERA in seven starts against the Marlins.	Marlins: RHP Jose Urena (1-3, 4.34 ERA) will make his seventh career start. Urena is 1-1 with a 2.66 ERA over his last four starts.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash never thought about letting his rookie starter go out for the seventh inning.	Why with such a strong bullpen?	Matt Andriese and three relievers combined on a three-hitter, Jake Elmore hit a two-run homer and the Rays beat the Boston Red Sox 4-1 on Saturday.	"Worked out kind of perfectly today," Cash said.	Andriese (3-2) retired his first 11 batters before allowing his lone baserunner, coming on a two-out single in the fourth by Xander Bogaerts. He struck out five in a career-high six innings as the Rays rebounded from a 4-3, 10-inning loss to the Red Sox Friday night.	"On a day where Andriese threw a lot of fastballs at us, for a lot of strikes, we never got anything going offensively," Boston manager John Farrell said.	After Jake McGee threw a perfect seventh, Kevin Jepsen gave up a solo homer in the eighth to Alejandro De Aza, who went deep for the second time in the last three games. Brad Boxberger allowed a single in a scoreless ninth for his 20th save.	"We have a lot of trust in our bullpen," Andriese said. "The big three back there, we have a lot of confidence in those guys."	Wade Miley (7-7) gave up two runs, five hits, two walks and struck out eight over 6 1/3 innings for Boston. The left-hander entered 3-0 with an 0.47 ERA in three previous starts against Tampa Bay.	Asdrubal Cabrera tripled leading off the fifth and scored on Elmore's one-out drive that cleared a low fence near the 315-foot marker in the left field corner to put the Rays up 2-0. Elmore had been hitless in his previous 12 at-bats.	"When I hit it, I didn't even think home run," Elmore said. "All I thought was, `please stay fair,' because I knew it was at least getting down (uncaught). Thankfully it did."	Miley had thrown 16 scoreless innings at Tropicana Field before Elmore's shot.	Rene Rivera made it 3-0 on a seventh-inning homer off Matt Barnes, who was recalled from Triple-A Pawtucket before the game. Evan Longoria had a solo shot in the eighth.	Tampa Bay tied a team-record with its 10th consecutive win against a left-handed starter. The Rays also did it in 2004.	Boston's Mookie Betts had his career-best 13-game hitting streak end after going 0 for 4. It was the longest streak by a Red Sox since Jacoby Ellsbury had a 19-game streak in 2013.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: LF Hanley Ramirez (left hand), who missed his third straight game, is not ready to swing a bat.	Rays: LHP Matt Moore (elbow surgery) made what may have been his final rehab start for Triple-A Durham against Columbus. ...

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Heads up, Robby!	No one in the Seattle Mariners' dugout expected a ball to come flying in and hit Robinson Cano -- the All-Star second baseman getting smacked on the left temple as the Los Angeles Angels' infielders were getting loose for the seventh inning of a 4-2 win Saturday.	Cano ended up with a sizable welt as a result of rookie shortstop Taylor Featherston's high throw over first baseman Albert Pujols. Cano felt dizzy and was taken to the clubhouse, where the Mariners' medical staff checked the second baseman for a concussion. No signs of one were found.	"I've been hit in the head before, but I've never had anything happen like this," Cano said. "He's a young guy, but I don't think there's a reason for him to throw that hard between innings. I didn't hear anything. It hurts more when you don't expect it. Hopefully, everything goes well through the night and I feel good enough to play."	Manager Lloyd McClendon sounded more optimistic.	"The Angels doctors checked him out and our staff checked him out. From what we've been told, he should be ready to go tomorrow," McClendon said.	To a man, Cano's teammates were relieved that it wasn't anything more series than a bump on the noggin.	"It was scary," Mariners starter J.A. Happ said. "I kind of saw it happen, and it sounded pretty gross. I saw the throw coming high, but I didn't have time to really react or say anything. I'm just glad he's OK, and I'm sure everybody else is, too."	Garrett Richards (8-5) pitched into the eighth inning, Kole Calhoun hit a two-run homer and third baseman David Freese made a couple of key defensive plays for the Angels.	"Richards is a tough pitcher, and we knew that coming in, so we knew it was going to be a low-scoring game," McClendon said. "He's tough. He lived at 69 most of the day and he had a nasty breaking ball."	Richards allowed two runs and seven hits in 7 2/3 innings, striking out six and walking one. The right-hander has given up four earned runs in 37 innings over his last five starts against Seattle and is 3-0 in those games.	"He was great. Garrett's been throwing the ball well all year long," Pujols said. "The best thing he's doing this year is relying on his off-speed stuff. Today he made some great pitches to get out of some jams. He's a gamer, man."	Huston Street got three outs for his 21st save in 23 chances. Joe Smith ended the eighth by striking out slugger Nelson Cruz representing the tying run.	Happ (3-5) gave up four runs and seven hits in seven innings and struck out six. The lefty is 0-4 with a 5.76 ERA over his last four starts after five consecutive no-decisions. In four career starts against the Angels, he is 0-4 with an 8.00 ERA.	Daniel Robertson, the sixth different player Angels manager Mike Scioscia has used in the leadoff spot, singled in the first and Calhoun hit his seventh home run.	Seattle got on the board in the sixth on Richards' wild pitch to Seth Smith after one-out singles by Mike Zunino and Logan Morrison put runners at the corners. Freese saved another run, making a diving stop to his right of Smith's ground single with the infield shifted way over against the lefty-swinging batter, and Cano grounded into a double play on the next pitch.	Seager led off the Seattle fifth with a single and advanced on a wild pitch before he was tagged out on an unassisted double play by Freese that ended the inning, after Freese caught Miller's line drive toward the hole.	The Angels loaded the bases with no outs in the seventh on a double by Mike Trout, an intentional walk to Pujols and a walk to Freese. Johnny Giavotella hit an RBI single, and Pujols scored on a groundout to make it 4-1.	Zunino hit a leadoff homer in the eighth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: SS Erick Aybar was not in the starting lineup for precautionary reasons because of tightness in his left hamstring, which he felt while running out a sacrifice bunt in the sixth inning of Friday night's 3-1 loss. He pinch-hit in the seventh for Matt Joyce and popped out.	UP NEXT	Mariners: RHP Felix Hernandez (10-4) is 5-0 with a 1.04 ERA in his last five starts against the Angels. The 2010 AL Cy Young Award winner and five-time All-Star won his second league ERA title last season with a 2.14 mark, but this year he's at 3.24 despite an AL-beat 10 wins.	Angels: LHP Hector Santiago (4-4) is 0-1 with a 4.57 ERA in four starts since beating Detroit 2-0 with 7 1/3 innings of three-hit ball on May 29 at Anaheim. He has made two career starts against Seattle, both losses, allowing eight earned runs in 9 1/3 innings.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ST. LOUIS --  The St. Louis Cardinals are the first major league team to 50 wins, and they are focused on continuing their success.	Michael Wacha pitched six solid innings, Xavier Scruggs had three hits and the Cardinals beat the Chicago Cubs 8-1 on Saturday night for their fifth straight win.	Jason Heyward reached four times as St. Louis improved to a major league-best 28-7 at home with its eighth consecutive win at Busch Stadium. The major league-best Cardinals (50-24) have five winning streaks of five games or more this season.	"We're not completely oblivious to it, but we're not spending a lot of time on it," manager Mike Matheny said of the team's record. "It's nice watching the bulk of these guys have success."	Wacha (10-3) allowed one run and six hits, bouncing back from a rough start at Philadelphia. The right-hander was tagged for five runs and eight hits in five innings against the Phillies in his worst start of the season last Sunday.	Chicago has lost four in a row after a four-game winning streak.	Cubs right-hander Donn Roach (0-1) lasted just 3 1/3 innings in his first major league appearance of the year. He was charged with four runs and eight hits while subbing for Tsuyoshi Wada, who has a sore elbow.	The Cardinals scored four runs in the fourth and fifth. Heyward singled and scored on Yadier Molina's double in the fourth, and walked and scored on Randal Grichuk's double in the fifth.	Scruggs, Kolten Wong and Matt Carpenter each drove in two runs as St. Louis reached the 50-win mark before July for the first time in franchise history. Scruggs, who was promoted from Triple-A Memphis on June 19, gave the Cardinals the lead for good with a run-scoring single in the fourth.	In Friday's series opener, rookie Greg Garcia, also recalled from Memphis on June 19, connected for a tying pinch-hit homer in the eighth, and the Cardinals went on to a 3-2 victory in 10 innings.	"Greg, he's my man and it was great to see him contribute like that," Scruggs said. "Tonight, I just wanted to get out there and do something, too."	Heyward, who was 2 for 3 with two walks and scored twice, enjoyed seeing the rookies step up.	"It just makes you feel good to see the young guys do that," Heyward said. "It also shows the depth of this team that guys like that can come up, step in, and contribute right away."	Wacha retired his last six batters and seemed to pick up steam as he went along.	"The last couple innings, I felt really good," Wacha said. "It was a struggle the first few innings, a lot of stressful innings. But it was nice to have couple easy ones."	Carlos Villanueva pitched three innings of one-hit ball against his former team for his first save of the year.	Roach drove in Starlin Castro with an RBI single in the second. Castro has hit safely in his last 12 games against St. Louis.	Roach set the Cardinals down in order in the third, but struggled in the fourth.	"I think they did a good job of staying up the middle," Roach said. "I obviously threw some mistakes today, but I didn't think it was that bad."	Chicago was 1 for 8 with runners in scoring position and is 2 for 17 in the series.	"No question, we had opportunities," Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. "We did a lot of good things early. We just have to do better. It's very simple."	NO CONTEST	St. Louis is 6-2 against Chicago this year, outscoring the Cubs 41-25. The Cardinals went 10-9 against the Cubs last year.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: OF Jorge Soler, who has been out since June 3 with a left ankle sprain, will likely start a minor league rehabilitation assignment early next week. Soler is on the 15-day disabled list.	Cardinals: LHP Jaime Garcia, who suffered a groin cramp running the bases in his last start, will not take his scheduled turn on Tuesday. He skipped a bullpen session Saturday and could return to the rotation as early as Wednesday. RHP Lance Lynn (5-4, 2.84 ERA) will start Tuesday.	UP NEXT	Cardinals RHP Carlos Martinez (8-3, 2.89 ERA) faces RHP Jason Hammel (5-2, 2.65 ERA) in the finale of the three-game series on Sunday night. Hammel has eight quality starts in his last 11 outings. The Cardinals are 11-3 in games started by Martinez this season.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN DIEGO --  If the San Diego Padres want to be more consistent, they will need Andrew Cashner to pitch like he did Saturday night.	Backed by Justin Upton's two-run homer, Casher threw strong seven innings and the San Diego Padres won consecutive games for the first time in three weeks with a 7-2 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks.	Cashner (3-9) hung tough as he held the Diamondbacks to two runs on eight hits. The right-hander escaped a bases-loaded, one-out jam in the second unscathed and got out of the third inning after allowing three consecutive doubles.	"I thought I did a good job of limiting the damage," he said. "I could have made some better pitches but I felt like I made some adjustments with my pitches."	Cashner, who struck out six and did not walk a batter, struck out Chris Owings and got pitcher Jeremy Hendrickson to ground out in the second to hold Arizona from scoring.	"I think he showed mental toughness tonight that reassured him that if he just stays the course, he can be pretty special," Padres interim manager Pat Murphy said.	Cashner won for the first time since May 27, a span of six starts. Cashner also drove in a run with a bunt single.	Cashner had a rough June coming into the start. In his last five starts he was 0-2 with a 7.62 ERA, including a four-inning start -- his shortest of the season -- in his last outing.	Upton connected for his 14th home run on a full-count pitch from Jeremy Hellickson (5-5) to break a 2-all tie in the fifth inning.	"The two-run homer by Justin really hurt us," Arizona manager Chip Hale said. "You have certain guys on teams you try to make sure don't beat you, and he's the guy on this club."	San Diego last won consecutive games during a four-game streak June 2-6. The victory moved San Diego ahead of Arizona into third place in the NL West. The Padres are 5-6 since Murphy took over after Bud Black was fired.	Upton's homer was his 11th at Petco Park and his first since he homered on June 13 to give the Padres a 2-1 win over the Dodgers.	"I just have to make a better pitch to that guy in that situation," Hellickson said. "If I walk him it's fine."	Will Venable and Clint Barmes led off the sixth with singles, and with one out, Cashner laid down a bunt between the mound and the third base line. Hellickson fielded the ball, but Venable slid home ahead of the tag.	Matt Kemp and Yangervis Solarte added RBI singles to push the Padres' lead to 7-2.	Hellickson allowed seven runs and 10 hits in 5 1/3 innings.  In four starts this season against San Diego, Hellickson is 1-2 with a 7.55 ERA having allowed 31 hits in 22 2/3 innings.	The Diamondbacks tied the game at 2-all in the third on three consecutive two-out doubles by Paul Goldschmidt, David Peralta and Yasmany Tomas.	POLAR OPPOSITES	Hellickson came in having allowed no unearned runs while Casher had given up a major league high 19 unearned runs, 11 more than the next closest pitcher.	NEARLY PERFECT VS. PADRES	Goldschmidt has reached base in 26 of his last 27 games against the Padres.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: LHP Patrick Corbin (Tommy John surgery) made his third rehab start on Friday night, allowing two runs on four hits in six innings for Double-A Mobile. Corbin is expected to make one more rehab start before a possible call-up to the majors.	Padres: 2B Cory Spangenberg left the game in the fourth inning with a sprained left knee. ... LHP Cory Luebke threw 11 pitches in one perfect inning in a rehab appearance with Double-A San Antonio on Friday night.  It was Luebke's fifth rehab outing as he attempts to come back from his second Tommy John surgery.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: RHP Chase Anderson (3-2, 3.54 ERA) will attempt to rebound from his worst outing of the season in a 10-5 loss at Colorado on Tuesday. Anderson allowed eight runs on eight hits and three walks while giving up three home runs.	Padres: RHP Odrisamer Despaigne (3-5, 4.83) has had mixed success against Arizona. The righty beat the D-backs on April 14 with seven innings of one-run, two-hit pitching in a 5-1 win. But Despaigne allowed season highs of eight runs on 10 hits in five innings on May 7 at Arizona in an 11-0 loss.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK -- Terry Collins was just happy the game ended. With a win in their pocket, the New York Mets could finally get to prized prospect Steven Matz's debut.	Lucas Duda drove in the winning run on the Cincinnati Reds' second bungled infield chance in the 13th inning, lifting the Mets to a 2-1 victory Sunday in the completion of a game suspended by rain a day earlier.	Curtis Granderson homered for New York and Brandon Phillips had an RBI double for the Reds on Saturday before the game was cut short after six innings with the score tied 1-all.	"We won the game. That's the only good thing that happened, besides the pitching," the Mets' manager said about 24 hours after the game started at 4:12 p.m. Saturday.	Granderson had a big hit in the 13th on Sunday, a single to right field off Nate Adcock (0-1) after Dilson Herrera drew a leadoff walk. Herrera raced to third base, and the Reds brought their infield in.	Eugenio Suarez, who was pinch-hitting in the top half when Ivan DeJesus Jr. was caught stealing to end the inning, could not handle Ruben Tejada's grounder to shortstop for an error that loaded the bases.	Cincinnati then brought in left fielder Skip Schumaker to form a five-man infield.	Duda hit a high chopper to first baseman Joey Votto, who leaped and initially snagged the ball before it fell out of his glove, giving him no play. Herrera slid home to give the Mets their third straight victory following a seven-game skid.	New York has managed only two runs in each of the wins -- and totaled all of 15 in its past 10 games. Mets pitchers, however, have yielded just two runs in the last 33 innings.	"That game didn't look like it was going to be won by a solo home run," Reds manager Bryan Price said. "It was going to need something like that, a walk or a mistake, that was going to lead to a win."	Bobby Parnell (1-0) pitched an inning in his sixth appearance since returning from Tommy John surgery. He earned his first win since June 6, 2013.	Reds slugger Todd Frazier fouled out with the bases loaded in the seventh, and both struggling lineups had chances to score in the late innings. Gold Glove center fielder Juan Lagares robbed Cincinnati's Jay Bruce of a homer in the eighth, and two fantastic plays by Schumaker in the seventh thwarted the Mets.	"We wouldn't have been in that situation to still be in the game in those late innings had Shu hadn't made those great plays in the seventh inning," Price said.	New York failed to take advantage of a two-base error by Votto in the 11th and went 0 for 15 with runners in scoring position for the game. The Reds left 12 on base.	Sunday's regularly scheduled game featured the heralded debut of Matz, who grew up about an hour from Citi Field on Long Island. He was called up as New York's 26th player on the roster.	Matz is the latest -- and perhaps last -- in a stellar crop of young pitchers to arrive with the Mets recently. The ace of the group, Matt Harvey, gave up a run over six solid innings in the rain Saturday night before being lifted for a pinch-hitter.	After using five relievers Sunday, Collins hoped he could get some distance from the rookie, but said: "The game will dictate how much latitude he has. Hopefully he pitches well."	Carlos Torres was announced as the Mets' first reliever Saturday, but the game was suspended before he took the mound.	When the game restarted, 20 minutes after the planned time because of more early rain in New York, the official scorer announced Reds rookie Michael Lorenzen's line -- he was lifted in the sixth inning Saturday night.	The Reds loaded the bases in the seventh, but Hansel Robles got Frazier to foul out.	Lorenzen matched Harvey most of the way Saturday and received relief help from Manny Parra, who retired Granderson on a 3-1 pitch with the bases loaded to end the sixth.	With the rain getting heavier, umpires stopped play and signaled for the tarp. The game was called following a 53-minute delay.	Phillips' double gave him a hit in all 31 road games he's played against the Mets.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: OF Jason Bourgeois (broken bone in left shoulder) was activated from the 60-day disabled list and added to the roster as the 26th man for the originally scheduled game. To make room on the 40-man roster, the Reds transferred RHP Jon Moscot to the 60-day DL.	Mets: INF Daniel Murphy (strained left quadriceps) went 1 for 3 and played five innings at third base in a rehab game with Class A St. Lucie. He could be back with the Mets on Tuesday.	UP NEXT	Reds: RHP Josh Smith made his second major league start in the series finale.	Mets: Matz was 7-4 with a 2.19 ERA and 94 strikeouts in 90 1/3 innings for Triple-A Las Vegas.	---	AP Baseball Writer Mike Fitzpatrick contributed to this report.

PHILADELPHIA -- Stephen Strasburg is happy to be back healthy and pitching well again.	Strasburg struck out a season-high nine in seven strong innings to lead the Washington Nationals to their eighth straight victory, 3-2 over the Philadelphia Phillies in the first game of a doubleheader on Sunday.	Strasburg (5-5) allowed two runs on four hits with one walk in his second good outing since returning from the disabled list.	"It's good to be back getting into a game and getting into a routine," he said. "My fastball command was good. Everything is off the fastball and I was locating it pretty good today."	Dan Uggla had three hits and Michael Taylor had two hits with a double and an RBI for the Nationals.	Jeff Francoeur homered for the Phillies, who dropped their third straight. Philadelphia, playing its second game under interim manager Pete Mackanin after Ryne Sandberg resigned on Friday, fell to 7-17 in June.	The game was part of a traditional doubleheader, with the second game scheduled to start 30 minutes after the first. The doubleheader was made necessary with Saturday's rainout after 1 1/2 innings.	The Nationals scored twice in the sixth. Taylor hit an RBI double off Kevin Correia (0-2) for a 2-1 lead, and the Nationals added another run when reliever Jake Diekman's pitch bounced off the glove of catcher Cameron Rupp for a passed ball.	The Phillies got a run back in the bottom half on Francoeur's RBI single.	But the Phillies couldn't get anything else off Strasburg, who retired the side in the seventh while striking out his final two batters. He set a season-high with 113 pitches.	Strasburg struggled in May, going 1/3 with an 8.00 ERA in five starts, and was placed on the disabled list with neck tightness following his May 29 start. He returned last Tuesday against Atlanta and pitched five shutout innings, giving up four hits, in a 3-1 win.	"He pitched great," Washington manager Matt Williams said. "We stretched him to (113) pitches and he had his good fastball even in the last inning. It's nice that he's healthy. It's important for him to stretch it today and also important for our whole team."	Drew Storen pitched a perfect ninth for his 23rd save.	Correia, making his fourth start for the Phillies, gave up three runs, one earned, on seven hits with four strikeouts and three walks in 5 1/3 innings. He knew he'd have to limit runs the way Strasburg was dealing.	"He kind of has it going again, and you have to limit the runs as much as possible," Correia said. "We were in the game and that's what I was looking for."	Francoeur's fifth homer of the season leading off the second put Philadelphia ahead 1-0.	The Nationals tied it in the fifth with some help from Francoeur.	Denard Span hit a liner to the right-field corner. Francoeur first bobbled the ball trying to pick it up, then it fell out of his hand as he tried to throw back to the infield. The ball went about 8 feet in front of him, drawing gasps from the crowd and a wry smile from Francoeur.	Span was credited with a double and went to third on Francoeur's error. He scored on Danny Espinosa's sacrifice fly.	FRANCO SNAPS SKID	Maikel Franco snapped an 0-for-10 slump with a sixth-inning single. The skid came on the heels of going 6 for 8 with three homers and 10 RBI last week in the first two games of a three-game series at Yankee Stadium.	NATIONALS' STREAK	Washington's streak is its best since winning 10 in a row last Aug. 12-21.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: 2B Yunel Escobar (bruised left hand) wasn't in the lineup after getting hit by a pitch on Friday night. OF Bryce Harper (hamstring) returned after missing two games and Span (back spasms) came back after sitting out Friday's contest.	UP NEXT	Nationals: After an off-day Monday, Washington opens a series at Atlanta on Tuesday with RHP Jordan Zimmermann (5-5, 3.42) facing Braves RHP Shelby Miller (5-3, 1.94).	Phillies: Philadelphia begins a four-game home series Monday night against the Brewers with RHP Sean O'Sullivan (1-5, 5.34) opposing Milwaukee RHP Jimmy Nelson (4-8, 4.34).	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

TORONTO --  Josh Donaldson woke up a slumbering offense with a homer and the Blue Jays produced just enough at the plate for a one-run win.	Donaldson hit his 18th home run, Drew Hutchison won his fifth straight decision and Toronto beat the Texas Rangers 3-2 Sunday.	Rangers starter Chi Chi Gonzalez set down the first 10 Blue Jays batters before Donaldson connected on a 3-2 pitch in the fourth, his first homer since June 10.	"Getting us on the board there, that's a huge thing," manager John Gibbons said.	The Blue Jays had just three hits Saturday when they were shut out for the second time this season.	Donaldson's drive rattled Gonzalez, who gave up two more runs the following inning.	"It threw me off my game," Gonzalez said. "It kind of made me more cautious. Instead of attacking hitters I started nitpicking and I started falling behind."	The Blue Jays won a game with four hits for the first time since beating Seattle last Sept. 24.	Donaldson had two of the four hits as the Blue Jays sent Texas to its eighth loss in 10 games. The Rangers went 2 for 15 with runners in scoring position and stranded the tying run at third base in each of the final four innings.	"We've got to be better with runners in scoring position," Rangers manager Jeff Banister said.	Hutchison (8-1) allowed one unearned run and four hits in 5 2/3 innings. He improved to 6-1 with a 2.12 ERA in eight home starts.	"I had a good changeup today," Hutchison said. "I thought I located the ball well."	Hutchinson ended each of the first four innings with a strikeout, stranding four runners.	Roberto Osuna got four outs for his second save as the Blue Jays beat the Rangers for the 12th time in 16 meetings.	Rougned Odor doubled to start the ninth but Prince Fielder and Adrian Beltre flied out before Osuna struck out Mitch Moreland on three pitches.	"Osuna continues to just be unbelievable," Hutchison said of his 20-year-old rookie teammate.	Gonzalez (2-3) lost his third straight decision. He gave up three runs and four hits in six innings.	Toronto made it 3-0 in the fifth. Ezequiel Carrera scored from first when Rangers left fielder Joey Gallo bobbled Devon Travis' double. Jose Reyes followed with an RBI single.	Texas cut it to 3-1 on an RBI single by Elvis Andrus in the sixth. Hutchison left one batter later after walking Gallo to load the bases.	Aaron Loup came on and escaped the jam by getting Leonys Martin to strike out looking.	Loup left after Texas loaded the bases with three straight singles in the seventh. Beltre drove in the second Texas run with a grounder off reliever Bo Schultz, but Moreland ended the inning by grounding out.	Andrus doubled off Steve Delabar to begin the eighth and went to third on Gallo's comebacker. Robinson Chirinos drew a two-out walk but Osuna came on and struck out Shin-Soo Choo on three pitches.	MULTIHIT ROYALTY	Fielder went 2 for 4, his fifth straight multihit game. Fielder leads the majors with 33 multihit games.	ONE RUN FUN	Toronto improved to 9-15 in one-run games.	END OF THE LINE	Toronto OF Kevin Pillar went 0 for 3, ending his career-high hitting streak at 11 games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: RHP Matt Harrison (back surgery) threw his second bullpen session of the weekend before the game and is scheduled to start at Triple-A Round Rock on Wednesday. "I'm confident that's all I'll need," Harrison said. ... OF Josh Hamilton (left hamstring) could be activated off the DL in time for Monday's game at Baltimore. Hamilton started in CF at Round Rock on Sunday and left the game after two at bats.	UP NEXT	Rangers: LHP Wandy Rodriguez (4-3, 4.06) gets the start as Texas begins a four-game series at Baltimore. RHP Bud Norris (2-6, 6.70) starts for the Orioles. Rodriguez is 4-0 with a 2.28 ERA in seven road starts.	Blue Jays: RHP R.A. Dickey (3-7, 4.88) faces RHP Clay Buchholz (5-6, 3.68) as Toronto begins a four-game series against Boston. Dickey has won just once in his past six starts. He's 0-2 with a 6.16 ERA in three starts against the Red Sox this season.	HOLLYWOOD HELPER	Canadian actor Stephen Amell, from the TV show "Arrow," has been promoting Donaldson's All-Star candidacy on Twitter and Facebook. Amell, who took batting practice before the game and hit a home run, was chatting with Donaldson in the Blue Jays clubhouse following the game.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DETROIT --  Some players go years without hitting a game-ending home run.	Detroit rookie James McCann has done it twice in the past six weeks.	McCann's solo homer in the bottom of the ninth inning completed a dramatic Detroit comeback, and the Tigers beat the Chicago White Sox 5-4 on Sunday. Detroit trailed 4-0 before scoring four runs in the eighth off Chicago starter Jeff Samardzija.	It was McCann's third homer of the year and his first since May 21, when the Detroit catcher went deep in the 11th inning to beat Houston.	"I think he's been doing a great job," teammate Victor Martinez said. "He's been catching great games, he's been swinging the bat pretty good. At this point I don't think anybody is surprised what he's doing. The guy can hit."	Martinez had the game's other big hit -- a three-run double that tied it in the eighth.	Joakim Soria (3-0) pitched a perfect top of the ninth, and McCann's one-out drive off Zach Putnam (1-3) cleared the fence in left field to end the game.	"An 0-2 pitch, I was just looking for something up," McCann said. "I knew it had a chance."	McCann has two game-ending homers in the first 61 games of his career. The last player to do that was Tim Salmon of the California Angels, according to STATS. Salmon's second came in 1993, in his 40th game.	Samardzija allowed only two hits over the first seven innings, but he couldn't make it through the eighth.	Samardzija was breezing along until McCann started the bottom of the eighth with a single. After a walk by Jose Iglesias and a single by Anthony Gose, the Chicago right-hander hit Ian Kinsler to force home the first Detroit run.	Miguel Cabrera struck out, but Martinez found the gap in right-center to clear the bases on Samardzija's 110th and final pitch.	"After he got Miggy, and especially the way he did it, he obviously still had something left in the tank to go after Victor," White Sox manager Robin Ventura said. "We were going hitter by hitter that inning, and we felt like Jeff was the best matchup."	Melky Cabrera homered and had three hits for the White Sox, who scored two runs each in the fourth and sixth. Detroit's David Price allowed four runs and six hits in six innings. He struck out five.	Price allowed only one hit through the first three innings, but Jose Abreu led off with a double in the fourth -- then advanced to third when Detroit's Yoenis Cespedes fell over while picking up the ball at the fence in left for an error. Avisail Garcia followed with a sacrifice fly, and Melky Cabrera made it 2-0 with his second homer of the season.	Adam Eaton tripled to start Chicago's sixth-inning rally. He scored on Garcia's single, and Adam LaRoche added a sacrifice fly.	CONFUSION	Both Price and Tigers manager Brad Ausmus used the word "miscommunication" to describe what happened after the sixth inning. The left-hander thought he was out of the game, but Ausmus was expecting him to continue. Price said he had gone back to the clubhouse already. He'd thrown 99 pitches.	"I was up here doing arm exercises," Price said. "(Justin Verlander) ran up the tunnel and said, `You are still in the game.' I said, `No, I'm not. I have zero uniform on right now."	Price said he'd take the blame for the confusion. The Tigers eventually summoned Alex Wilson in from the bullpen.	BOTTOM OF THE ORDER	Samardzija was disappointed about the way the eighth-inning rally started, with Detroit's No. 8 and 9 hitters getting on base.	"I'd say from 2-7, everyone in that lineup is capable of putting up a crooked number at any moment," he said. "The problem was that I didn't get the other guys in that inning. I let McCann get on, and then the walk to Iglesias."	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox: Abreu looked as if he was in a bit of discomfort after reaching third base in the fourth, but he stayed in the game. He also remained in after being hit by a pitch in the sixth.	Tigers: C Alex Avila (left knee) caught for Triple-A Toledo on Sunday and went 1 for 3 as part of his rehab assignment.	UP NEXT	Both teams are off Monday.	White Sox: Ace Chris Sale (6-4) takes the mound at St. Louis on Tuesday night. Lance Lynn (5-4) starts for the Cardinals. Sale is the fourth pitcher in major league history to strike out 10 or more in at least seven consecutive starts. His seven-start streak began May 23.	Tigers: Verlander (0-1) returns from a back issue to face Pittsburgh's Gerrit Cole (11-3) on Tuesday night.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MIAMI --  To earn his first win since May 5, all Zack Greinke needed was a lead.	The Los Angeles Dodgers finally gave him one Sunday, and Greinke pitched 7 2/3 innings for his first victory in his past 10 starts, beating the Miami Marlins 2-0.	Greinke (6-2) allowed four hits and held the opposition without a run for his third start in a row, extending his scoreless streak to 20 2/3 innings.	In the previous two outings he departed with the game scoreless, and this time he left leading 2-0. Greinke's reaction when the Dodgers scratched out their first run in the fifth?	"I think I saw him dancing on the inside," manager Don Mattingly said.	"I don't think about it too much," Greinke said. "One run is not too much. Two felt a little better, because then you could mess around a little bit with no one on base."	Adrian Gonzalez, who had three hits, drove in the second run in the seventh. Against Greinke and the Dodgers' bullpen -- and because of the Marlins' offensive woes -- a 2-0 lead proved more than enough.	Greinke came into the game with the lowest ERA in the majors and reduced it to 1.58. The right-hander's description of his season: "A little bit of luck, and a little bit of skill."	But Mattingly said Greinke's year has been comparable to the MVP season teammate Clayton Kershaw had in 2014.	"Every outing is really, really good," Mattingly said. "This year he has been sharp from the very beginning."	Greinke has an ERA of 1.59 over the past 10 games but is just 1-2 during that span because of poor run support.	Two relievers completed a five-hitter for the Dodgers' 11th shutout. Kenley Jansen pitched around a leadoff double in the ninth for his 11th save in 12 chances. That extended the bullpen's scoreless streak to 12 2/3 innings over five games.	The Dodgers, who took the rubber game in the series, have allowed 13 runs in their past eight games.	Jose Urena (1-4) pitched five innings, and a defensive misplay resulted in the only run he allowed.	The Marlins fell to 1-5 on their homestand. They were playing their second consecutive game without slugger Giancarlo Stanton, who is expected to be sidelined four to six weeks with a broken left hand.	Miami went 0 for 5 with runners in scoring position and is 2 for 38 (.053) in those situations during the homestand. The Marlins are batting .203 in their past 11 games.	"We'd like to push some runs across and take some pressure off our defense and pitching," catcher Jeff Mathis said. "But you just have to keep grinding."	Josh Beckett, who won the clinching game of the 2003 World Series for the Marlins and tossed a no-hitter for the Dodgers, threw out the ceremonial first pitch. And in the early going, Greinke and Urena threw like Beckett at his best.	The Dodgers, who were hurt by defensive mistakes in their loss Saturday, benefited from a Marlins lapse in the fifth inning.	With runners at first and third and one out, Howie Kendrick hit a grounder to second that looked like a routine double-play ball. But shortstop Adeiny Hechavarria's relay throw to first was wide, and first baseman Justin Bour was unable to stay on the bag because of poor footwork, allowing Kendrick to beat the throw for a 1-0 Dodgers lead.	Gonzalez's double scored a run in the seventh.	The Dodgers won despite going 0 for 9 with runners in scoring position and stranding 12.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers RF Yasiel Puig, back in lineup after missing three starts with a torn callus on his left hand, went 0 for 2 with three walks.	UP NEXT	Marlins: RHP Mat Latos (2-5, 5.49 ERA) is scheduled to start Tuesday against Giants RHP Ryan Vogelsong (6-5, 4.05).	Dodgers: RHP Mike Bolsinger (4-2, 2.95 ERA) is scheduled to start Monday at Arizona against RHP Allen Webster (1-1, 6.46).	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PITTSBURGH --  Alex Wood can tell the instant a breaking ball leaves his hand whether he has a feel for it on a given day. When he does, the Atlanta Braves lefty can be dominant.	Wood pitched shutout ball into the eighth inning Sunday to win for the first time in five starts, and the Braves held on for a 2-1 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates.	Wood (5-5) scattered five hits and struck out eight without a walk in 7 1/3 innings as Atlanta ended a season-high, five-game losing streak.	"When you get all three (pitches) going, those usually turn into pretty fun days," Wood said. "We needed a win today and everybody came to play and definitely it feels good to get out of Pittsburgh with a W."	Jace Peterson hit his third homer for the Braves. Chris Johnson added two hits and Nick Markakis drove in a run. Jason Grilli gave up a run during an eventful ninth but earned his 21st save.	Pirates star Andrew McCutchen went 1 for 4 after getting hit on the left elbow Saturday by a pitch from Julio Teheran. McCutchen wore a large brace for protection after experimenting with a couple of them before the game.	Wood's only real spot of trouble came in the seventh when McCutchen and Starling Marte hit consecutive singles to start the inning. Francisco Cervelli, who came in batting .389 against lefties, tried to bunt for a hit. Wood kept his feet and threw out Cervelli, credited with a sacrifice as the runners advanced. But Wood struck out Jordy Mercer and got Sean Rodriguez to fly out.	"I was honestly surprised Cervelli bunted there," Wood said.	So was Pirates manager Clint Hurdle.	"He thought he was going to make a baseball play and give the guy behind him an opportunity," Hurdle said. "The guy made a good play. I don't have a `Don't bunt for a base hit' sign. He had a feel for it."	Cervelli defended the move, saying he would do it again if given the chance.	Atlanta didn't do much against Pittsburgh starter Jeff Locke (4-4), managing only an RBI single by Markakis in the fifth. Peterson homered off reliever Vance Worley in the seventh to give the Braves a little breathing room.	Grilli, an All-Star closer for the Pirates in 2013 who took the loss in a 10-inning defeat on Friday, made Wood's hard work hold up but not without some excitement.	Cervelli walked with two outs and Mercer sent a long drive to the wall in left-center. Cameron Maybin and Eury Perez collided when both tried to make the catch. The ball glanced off Maybin's glove as Cervelli scored and Mercer raced to second with his third hit of the game.	Perez stayed down for several moments but walked off the field without assistance. Grilli struck out pinch-hitter Gregory Polanco to end it.	"Luckily, Cameron Maybin's OK and Eury got checked," Atlanta manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "It was more of his torso than it was the head. But there's nothing there. Hopefully we dodged a bullet there."	McCutchen appeared just fine less than 24 hours after the first inning of Saturday's game when Teheran's 92 mph fastball smacked him in the elbow, the eighth time this season and the 48th time in his career he's been hit. The 2013 NL MVP joked he might need to "drop kick" an opposing pitcher to stop getting buzzed. He was diagnosed with a bone bruise and texted Hurdle on Sunday morning saying he was good to go.	Wearing a large black pad on the elbow, McCutchen didn't appear limited at the plate. He hit three long fly balls to go with his single.	"I just found whatever worked," McCutchen said. "I tried on a couple of them. Said, `This one worked.' Pretty easy. Pretty simple."	MOVING UP, MOVING OUT	Braves: Atlanta brought up reliever Ryan Kelly from Triple-A Gwinnett and sent struggling RHP Sugar Ray Marimon back to the minors.	Pirates: The odd career of Pirates OF Jose Tabata took another turn when Pittsburgh designated him for assignment for a second time. Tabata, who signed a six-year contract in 2011 and is due $4 million this season, hit .289 in 27 games with the Pirates after beginning the season at Triple-A Indianapolis. General manager Neal Huntington said he believes Tabata is open to returning to the minors if he clears waivers. The Pirates called up OF Gorkys Hernandez and immediately inserted him into the lineup. Hernandez went hitless in his first appearance in the majors since 2012.	UP NEXT	Braves: Atlanta returns home for a three-game series with Washington beginning on Tuesday. The Nationals swept Atlanta last week, outscoring the Braves 12-2 in the process. Shelby Miller (5-3, 1.94 ERA) goes for his first victory in nearly six weeks.	Pirates: Gerrit Cole will try to bounce back from his worst performance of the year when the Pirates open a three-game set in Detroit on Tuesday. Cole (11-3, 2.16 ERA) leads the majors in wins but was touched up by Cincinnati for a season-high five runs in 4 2/3 innings last Wednesday, his first loss in more than a month.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

BALTIMORE --  The Baltimore Orioles are feeling a whole lot better these days about making Ubaldo Jimenez a $50 million man.	Jimenez pitched eight innings of four-hit ball to win his fourth straight start, Jimmy Paredes and Manny Machado homered and Baltimore defeated the Cleveland Indians 4-0 Sunday in the opener of a split doubleheader.	The victory was the Orioles' 5,000th since their move from St. Louis to Baltimore in 1954.	Jimenez (7-3) struck out seven, walked none and allowed only one runner past first base. After going 6-9 with a 4.81 ERA last year, the right-hander leads the team in wins, strikeouts and owns a solid 3.09 ERA.	That's what the Orioles were looking in February 2014 for when they signed him as a free agent to a four-year, $50 million contract.	"We're getting to see the guy we thought Ubaldo could be," manager Buck Showalter said. "A lot of strike ones, a lot of movement and taking advantage of the counts."	Jimenez came in 0-2 with an 8.10 ERA in three career starts against Cleveland, the team he played for from 2011-13 after winning a combined 34 games with Colorado during the previous two seasons.	"Every time I take the mound, I feel like I can give the team a chance to win," Jimenez said. "That's what I did in 2010 and 2009, so I feel that's what I am capable of doing right now."	The Indians were powerless against him.	"That was the Ubaldo we've seen when he was good. It just seemed we were 0-1, 1-2 all day," Cleveland manager Terry Francona said. "We've seen a lot of him nibbling when he's off. We've also seen him a lot like this."	Brian Matusz and Chaz Roe each issued a walk in the ninth.	Jimenez outpitched Trevor Bauer (6-5), who gave up four runs, five hits and a walk over seven innings.	Bauer's road ERA rose from 1.10 to 1.69 after he yielded more than one home run in a game for the first time in 15 starts this season.	"It's tough when they hit eight or nine balls hard," Bauer said. "Usually I give up eight or nine hard hits in the course of like two or three games."	With a 4-1 record against Cleveland and only the nightcap remaining, the Orioles clinched their first season series win against the Indians since 2006. Baltimore has won 14 of 18 to move a season-high six games over .500 (40-34).	Michael Brantley had two hits for the Indians, who have lost six of eight. Jason Kipnis went 0 for 4, ending his 20-game hitting streak.	The second game of the doubleheader, scheduled to start at 7:05 p.m., was the makeup of a rainout on Saturday night.	Paredes put the Orioles ahead in the third inning with a drive to left following a single by Caleb Joseph. Paredes has nine home runs in 55 games after hitting just five in 145 games before this season.	Machado led off the sixth with his 15th homer, a career high. Later in the inning, doubles by Paredes and Chris Davis made it 4-0.	ROSTER MOVES	Indians: Japanese right-hander Toru Murata was brought in from Triple-A Columbus to make his major league debut in the second game.	Orioles: LHP T.J. McFarland was added as the 26th player to give Baltimore a seventh arm in its thin bullpen.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: DH/OF Nick Swisher (left knee inflammation) remains with the team as he works to return from the 15-day DL. He's been sidelined since June 14. "It's the hardest thing I've gone through in my life," Swisher said. "I miss crashing into walls every day."	Orioles: CF Adam Jones (sore right shoulder) started for the first time since June 20. Saying he was "bored" watching from the dugout, Jones insisted he was "good to go."	ON DECK	Indians: Cleveland was seeking to avoid being swept for the first time in 16 doubleheaders over the last six seasons.	Orioles: RHP Chris Tillman took a three-game winning streak into the nightcap.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MILWAUKEE --  At this point in the season, any win is a well-timed one for the Milwaukee Brewers.	Ryan Braun and Adam Lind hit two-run homers in the eighth inning and the Brewers beat the Minnesota Twins 5-3 on Sunday.	The Brewers have the second-worst record in the majors, only ahead of Philadelphia.	"We've gotten to a point where we need to get back to wanting to win, to feeling like we're going to win, to showing up and feeling like we've got a legitimate chance to win," Braun said. "I think winning is something that's learned as a team."	The Brewers weathered a Twins rally in the ninth inning and won the three-game series.	Down 5-1, Torii Hunter, who homered twice Saturday, hit a two-run homer off Francisco Rodriguez. Two quick outs followed Hunter's blast, but then the Twins got a pair of singles to put runners at the corners.	Brian Dozier, who had hit safely in all nine previous career games at Miller Park, took a called third strike to end the game.	Will Smith (4-0) retired the Twins in order in the eighth.	The Brewers pushed a run across off reliever Blaine Boyer in the seventh. Aramis Ramirez led off with a double and left for pinch-runner Hector Gomez, who advanced on a sacrifice and scored when Gerardo Parra, batting for starter Mike Fiers, lined a single.	It was tied at 1 when Jonathan Lucroy opened the Milwaukee eighth with a walk from reliever Casey Fien (2-3). Braun followed with his 15th home run.	"There's strikes and then there's quality strikes and I didn't throw enough quality strikes," Fien said. "The strikes I did throw, they hit."	Carlos Gomez then singled, stole second and scored on Lind's 11th homer.	"I'm just glad to get on base, to be honest," Lucroy said. "It's been a battle. Brauny and then Gomey and Adam, they had some really good at-bats after me."	Lucroy agreed with Braun that the team needs to find its winning edge.	"We've got some good hitters in the lineup," Lucroy said. "We've got to put it all together, so we can get all clicking."	Twins starter Tommy Milone cruised through the first five innings with seven strikeouts and one hit, a bloop single by Hernan Perez in the second.	Milone went six innings and allowed two hits.	Twins manager Paul Molitor was impressed with the left-hander's effort.	"He was solid," Molitor said. "He put up a lot of zeroes for us and gave us a chance. I was hoping when he came out of the game, we could get him a run and maybe get him a win. It was looking good, but the Brewers have played us tough."	Fiers was just as effective through six, retiring 16 of the first 20 batters, and holding the Twins to two hits. In the seventh, Joe Mauer and Trevor Plouffe reached on singles. One out later, Kurt Suzuki walked and Eduardo Escobar's sacrifice fly into left was just deep enough for Mauer to beat the throw home.	Fiers went seven innings, allowed four hits, struck out four and walked three.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Twins: Molitor hasn't determined yet how to reshuffle the starting rotation after RHP Ervin Santana returns July 5 following his 80-game suspension after testing positive for a performance-enhancing substance. "It's not a no-brainer as far as what the solution will be," Molitor said. The 32-year-old right-hander, thought to be the No. 2 starter, is in his first year with the Twins after signing a four-year, $55 million contract in the offseason. He also has a $14 million team option for a fifth year.	Brewers: No date has been set for LF Khris Davis' rehab assignment. He's been on the 15-day DL with a torn meniscus in his right knee.	UP NEXT	Twins: RHP Mike Pelfrey (5-4) makes his eighth career start and ninth career appearance against the Reds in Cincinnati on Monday. He last faced the Reds on July 27, 2011, while with the New York Mets.	Brewers: RHP Jimmy Nelson (4-8) aims for his seventh quality start and first ever against the Phillies in Philadelphia on Monday.	MOLITOR BOBBLEHEAD	Molitor was honored by his former team with a bobblehead. "For them to do one for the visiting manager, I thought that was a pretty nice gesture," he said. "The players are giving me a hard time, which makes it fun."	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

HOUSTON --  Houston rookie Carlos Correa has amassed enough big plays to fill a highlight reel despite being in the majors for less than a month.	He continued to pile them up on Sunday, doubling twice and scoring the tiebreaking run on a triple by Evan Gattis in the seventh inning to help the Astros to a 3-1 win over the New York Yankees.	"I'm glad he's on our team and he's really doing some special things that are either helping us stay in games or win games," manager A.J. Hinch said. "I appreciate his talent. Having been around this league, it's a unique set of skills and tools and charisma."	The 20-year-old Correa, who made his major league debut on June 8, also scored Houston's first run when he doubled and scored on an error by Brett Gardner in the fourth inning.	"I'm seeing the ball well, pretty good and feeling comfortable out there," Correa said. "We have a good lineup, so when you're hitting with a great lineup you feel comfortable. It doesn't put that much pressure on you."	Collin McHugh (9-3) allowed a season-low two hits -- both singles -- and one run and eight strikeouts in eight innings for his third straight win. Luke Gregerson pitched a perfect ninth for his 18th save.	"I'm not sure I can accurately describe that," Hinch said of his performance. "He was fantastic, as dominant as we could ask him to be. Had every pitch working."	The game was tied 1-1 when Correa doubled with no outs in the seventh and advanced to third on a sacrifice bunt by Jose Altuve. The triple by Gattis, which sailed just out of reach of center fielder Gardner and bounced off the low wall in left-center, scored Correa and put Houston on top 2-1.	New York starter Michael Pineda (8-5) allowed seven hits and three runs -- two earned- and struck out eight in eight innings for the first complete game of his career. The solid performance comes after he allowed 11 hits and eight runs -- both career highs -- in his previous start.	The Astros added an insurance run when Preston Tucker scored on a sacrifice fly by Jason Castro in the eighth to make it 3-1.	Correa, the top overall pick in the 2012 draft, has nine doubles and five homers in just 20 games. He's the first player in franchise history to have nine doubles in his first 20 games and joins Rusty Staub, George Springer and Jeff Bagwell as the only players in Houston history to reach safely in at least 18 of their first 20 games.	Stephen Drew walked with one out in the third inning and reached second on a wild pitch. He scored on a single by Gardner to give New York a 1-0 lead.	McHugh retired the next 10 in a row after Gardner's hit. The Yankees didn't have another baserunner until a single by Alex Rodriguez with two outs in the sixth inning. But he retired Mark Teixeira to end that inning before throwing perfect seventh and eighth innings.	Correa doubled with one out in the fourth inning and scored on the error by Gardner when he and left fielder Garrett Jones allowed the ball to drop between them and roll away to make it 1-1.	"They both were calling," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "Neither one of them heard each other. Obviously it's a play that has to be made."	Altuve made a nifty catch for the last out of the second inning when he sprinted to grab a ball hit by Rodriguez in shallow right field, but bobbled it, causing it to pop out of his glove, before reeling it in.	Teixeira grabbed a grounder hit by Gattis in the second inning, but lost his footing. He regained it by pushing his hand onto the barrel chest of first base umpire Joe West before stepping on first base for the out. Teixeira looked back at West after the play and the pair shared a laugh.	New York's Chris Young went 0 for 3 to snap a career-long 10-game hitting streak.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: RHP Scott Feldman, who had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee on May 29, will throw a simulated game early next week in Houston. If that goes well he could go on a rehabilitation assignment. ... OF Colby Rasmus was out for a second straight game with a skin infection on his arm. Hinch said he was doing better on Sunday and should return on Monday.	Yankees: CF Jacoby Ellsbury, out since May 19 with a sprained right knee, will be in Class A Tampa on Monday and the Yankees anticipate he will begin playing in rehab games later in the week.	UP NEXT	The Yankees open a three-game series against the Los Angeles Angels on Monday when CC Sabathia (3-7) opposes C.J. Wilson (5-6). Sabathia looks to bounce back from his most recent start where he allowed eight hits and six runs in 4 2/3 innings. It was the second time this season that he's pitched less than five innings.	The Astros wrap up their homestand with a three-game series against Kansas City starting on Monday when rookie Lance McCullers opposes Joe Blanton. The 21-year-old McCullers will be making his ninth major league start after not factoring in the decision in his past start when he allowed four hits and a run in six innings in a loss in Anaheim.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  When Felix Hernandez is pitching, the Los Angeles Angels will take a win any way they can get it.	Held to one hit over six innings by the All-Star right-hander, the Angels squeaked out a 3-2 victory Sunday as Kole Calhoun scored on a wild pitch by Tom Wilhelmsen in the 10th inning after Albert Pujols grounded into a bases-loaded double play against a five-man infield.	Four players in the Angels' lineup came in with some brutal career numbers against Hernandez. Calhoun was 1 for 21, David Freese was 0 for 15, and Chris Iannetta and Matt Joyce each 2 for 24. They ended up a combined 0 for 6 with three walks against Hernandez on Sunday.	"They're tough odds, but that's why it's a beautiful game. We get to go out there and take our cracks at him," Calhoun said. "He's got some of the best stuff I've ever seen. So anytime you can win a game that Felix starts, it's a good day."	Johnny Giavotella led off the 10th with a line-drive single off Wilhelmsen's glove. Calhoun followed with a hit-and-run single that put runners at the corners, and Mike Trout was intentionally walked for the second straight time.	Seattle manager Lloyd McClendon then motioned left fielder Dustin Ackley in for a five-man infield, and Pujols grounded into a 6-2-3 double play started by shortstop Brad Miller. But Wilhelmsen (1-2) uncorked his first wild pitch of the season on a full count with runners at second and third and rookie Kyle Kubitza at the plate.	"All I was thinking about there was that they were just waiting for fastballs, so I'm just going to throw off-speed stuff," Wilhelmsen said. "I switched to the changeup, and it cut on me instead of ran away. The ball usually doesn't do that, but it did today. Pretty costly."	Trevor Gott (1-0) earned his first major league victory with a perfect 10th inning.	The Angels tied the score 1-all in the seventh with an RBI single by pinch-hitter Erick Aybar against Mark Lowe. The run was changed to Charlie Furbush, who hit Freese with a pitch to open the inning.	Calhoun put Los Angeles ahead 2-1 in the eighth with an RBI single off Joe Beimel, but closer Huston Street gave up Kyle Seager's 12th homer in the ninth after striking out Robinson Cano and retiring Nelson Cruz.	The blown save was the third in 24 opportunities this season for Street, who remains four saves shy of 300.	"Kyle Seager's a great player. I left a pitch right down the middle and he did what you're supposed to do in that situation -- you put it in the bleachers," Street said. "I'm not upset at all, honestly. I mean, you're upset when it happens, but when you win the game, I don't care. You can't care. There's no reason to care. We won, that's the point of today. I preach that all the time."	Angels lefty Hector Santiago retired his first 10 batters before giving up a one-out single in the fourth to Franklin Gutierrez, a walk to Cano and an RBI double by Cruz.	"My whole goal out there was to get deep in the game and give us a chance to win," Santiago said. "When you're facing Felix, you almost have to pitch a perfect game to compete with him. I made some good pitches when I needed to and got some big outs."	Hernandez issued a leadoff walk in the sixth to Calhoun, then got a visit from McClendon with a 2-0 count on Trout, who grounded into a double play on a 3-0 delivery before Pujols flied out on Hernandez's 96th and final pitch.	On his way back to the dugout, Hernandez walked over to Pujols near first base and shared a lighthearted moment. The three-time NL MVP has hit one of his 543 career homers in 45 at-bats against the 2010 AL Cy Young Award winner.	"That's just a great grind-out win against an incredible pitcher," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.	Cano showed no ill effects after getting knocked out of Saturday's game. He was sitting in the dugout talking to Gutierrez before the start of the seventh inning when an errant warmup throw past first base from shortstop Taylor Featherston struck Cano in the left temple.	UP NEXT	Mariners: Rookie LHP Mike Montgomery (2-2) takes his 2.02 ERA into the opener of a two-game set at San Diego on Tuesday night, one day before his 26th birthday. He is coming off a 7-0 victory over Kansas City in which he pitched a five-hitter and struck out 10 without walking a batter in his fifth big league start.	Angels: LHP C.J. Wilson hooks up again with struggling CC Sabathia on Monday night in the opener of a three-game series against the visiting Yankees. Wilson gave up a season-high seven runs over 3 1/3 innings last Tuesday in a 13-3 home loss to Houston. On June 7 at Yankee Stadium, he gave up six runs and three homers in a 6-2 loss to Sabathia.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  Jeremy Guthrie and Salvador Perez delivered a milestone win for the Kansas City Royals.	Guthrie struck out a season-high seven batters to top 1,000 for his career and Perez homered for his 500th career hit to help Kansas City complete a three-game sweep of the Oakland Athletics with a 5-3 victory on Sunday.	"We had two big milestones today, which I think are big," manager Ned Yost said. "So they got that behind them and now they just keep moving forward."	Omar Infante hit a tiebreaking single in a three-run sixth inning for the Royals, who have won five of six to open a nine-game road trip.	Guthrie (6-5) allowed two runs in six innings and reached 1,005 career strikeouts in his 12th big league season.	"It's 1,000 more than I thought I'd probably ever thought I'd have," he said. "It's a great accomplishment to be able to get there and have the endurance to get to that number."	Perez took much less time to reach his big number, getting there in his fifth season with a homer in the eighth inning off Edward Mujica that provided insurance for the Royals.	"It means a lot," he said. "It's pretty special to me."	The Royals bullpen did the rest with Wade Davis pitching the ninth for his ninth save in as many chances as Kansas City swept the A's for the first time since 2008.	Jesse Chavez (4-7) was hurt by an error by third baseman Max Muncy in Kansas City's three-run sixth inning as Oakland lost its third straight following a season-long five-game winning streak.	"We were playing really good ball lately and this happens," Muncy said. "It's really frustrating that we had good momentum going as a team and we were playing really good ball."	Billy Burns helped spark a two-run third inning for Oakland when he led off with a single to extend his hitting streak to 16 straight games.	Ben Zobrist drove in the first run with a sacrifice fly and Josh Reddick made it 2-0 when his popup to shallow left fell between shortstop Alcides Escobar and left fielder Alex Gordon for his 500th career hit.	A poor defensive play by Oakland helped the Royals take the lead in the sixth. With runners on first and third and one out, Perez hit a slow grounder to third base. Muncy charged and his throw home was high. Mike Moustakas scored on the fielder's choice and the runners advanced to second and third on Muncy's throwing error.	Alex Rios tied the game with a sacrifice fly and Infante gave the Royals their first lead with his two-out hit that knocked out Chavez.	"I got to stop the bleeding and make a pitch," Chavez said. "It didn't go our way. I made a pitch to the next hitter for what would have been the third out. I've still got to stop the bleeding there. There's no excuse for it. It's all my fault."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals: OF Lorenzo Cain did not start after tweaking his hamstring stealing a base Saturday. He pinch hit for Eric Hosmer in the eighth and singled. Hosmer, who was moved to DH from first base, sprained his left ring finger on that same double steal Saturday and left Sunday's game early. He is day to day. ... Escobar was also removed in the eighth inning for precautionary reasons with a split nail on his right index finger, but Yost said he thought Escobar would be able to play Monday.	Athletics: Burns (hip flexor) returned to the lineup after missing the previous two games.	STREAKING	Burns had two hits and is one game away from tying the Oakland rookie hitting streak record of 17 games shared by Mike Edwards (1978), Luis Polonia (1987) and Terrence Long (2000).	UP NEXT	Royals: Joe Blanton (2-0) takes the mound at Houston in the opener of a three-game series between first-place teams. Lance McCullers (3-2) pitches for the Astros.	Athletics: Kendall Graveman, who is 3-2 with a 2.31 ERA in seven starts since being recalled from the minors, starts the opener of a three-game series against Colorado.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

SAN FRANCISCO --  With his arm and bat, Madison Bumgarner keeps piling up impressive numbers.	Bumgarner hit his eighth career home run and also struck out his 1,000th batter, leading the San Francisco Giants over the Colorado Rockies 6-3 Sunday.	The World Series MVP had already singled and scored when he hit a solo homer in the seventh inning.	"That's a special moment," Bumgarner said. "Anything to help us put runs on the board."	Buster Posey drove in three runs for San Francisco, and Matt Duffy was a single short of the cycle. Brandon Crawford connected for his 10th homer, matching his career-best total from last season.	Bumgarner (8-4) allowed two runs on Nolan Arenado's 23rd homer in the first and five hits in 7 2/3 innings.	Bumgarner was proud to reach the four-digit mark in strikeouts.	"That's pretty special," Bumgarner said. "You have to spend some time here and be able to have that success."	Bumgarner became the youngest Giant in San Francisco history to fan 1,000, the 13th pitcher in franchise history and the third left-hander, joining Hall of Famer Carl Hubbell and former Cy Young winner Mike McCormick.	"Bum, he did it all," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "He pitched great after that first inning, started a rally with a single and then the home run."	Arenado added another homer in the ninth against Sergio Romo. Javier Lopez then retired Carlos Gonzalez, and Santiago Casilla got two outs for his 21st save.	Arenado extended his hitting streak to 15 games and set a franchise record for consecutive games (12) with at least one hit and one run scored.	"He's definitely in a zone," Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. "He's a special player."	Posey's 26 RBI in June are second only to Arenado's 33. Posey's two-run single in the third put the Giants ahead to stay.	Kyle Kendrick (3-10) was charged with five runs and eight hits in 5 2/3 innings.	Duffy tripled in the first, doubled in the third and hit a home run in the sixth. He came to the plate with one out and a runner on in the seventh and a ball hit down the first base line was called foul. During the ensuing replay, which confirmed the ruling, fans began chanting "Single! Single!"	Duffy then bounced into an inning-ending double play.	Bumgarner struck out Brandon Barnes in the second for his 1,000th strikeout, prompting a standing ovation. He finished with eight strikeouts and two walks.	TRAINER'S TABLE	Rockies: RHP Tyler Chatwood (Tommy John surgery) threw another bullpen session as part of his recovery from a second surgery. "He's in the process of building himself back up again," manager Walt Weiss said. "We've talked about having him back this year but there is no timetable." ... LHP Jorge De La Rosa (split middle finger on left hand) appears to be on target to make his next scheduled start in Oakland on Tuesday. "I thought his start would be in jeopardy," Weiss said. "It looks like it closed up in time."	Giants: RHP Tim Lincecum will need at least a week to recover from a contusion on his right forearm, the result of getting hit by a line drive Saturday. "He's sore," Bochy said. "It will serve him well to back off a little bit, and give him a break. With the injury, it's a no-brainer now." ... OF Hunter Pence played catch for the first time since returning to the DL with soreness in his left wrist.	UP NEXT:	Rockies: RHP David Hale (2-2, 5.86 ERA) gets the start Monday night when the Rockies open an interleague series in Oakland. He has allowed five earned runs in each of his last two starts. He is 0-2 with a 10.32 ERA in seven interleague games, including one start. He has never faced Oakland.	Giants: RHP Ryan Vogelsong (6-5, 4.05 ERA) gets the ball when San Francisco begins a three-game series at Miami on Tuesday night. He is 3-3 with a 1.89 ERA in 10 career appearances, including six starts, against the Marlins. That is his lowest ERA against an opponent he has faced more than three times.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.
