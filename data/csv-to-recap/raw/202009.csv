ST. LOUIS --  Yadier Molina, wearing uniform No. 21 in honor of Roberto Clemente, hit a go-ahead, two-run homer in the second inning that started the St. Louis Cardinals to a 12-2 win over the skidding Detroit Tigers in a doubleheader opener on Thursday.	The normally stoic Molina jumped into the air after passing first base and appeared to wipe away a tear with his uniform sleeve as he approached home plate.	Born in Bayamon, Puerto Rico, Molina was among players from the commonwealth who wore the number as part of Major League Baseball's tributes this week to Clemente, who died when a plane crashed en route to a relief mission in Nicaragua on Dec. 31, 1972.	Molina put St. Louis ahead 2-0 in the second against Tarik Skubal (1-2) with his third home run this season. With his 158th home run for St. Louis, Molina passed Johnny Mize and moved into sole possession of 10th on the Cardinals career list.	Molina has said Clemente was his childhood hero, and Molina received the 2018 Roberto Clemente Award, awarded annually to a player who exemplifies sportsmanship, community involvement and the individual's contribution to his team.	Lane Thomas, Tyler O'Neill, Paul Goldschmidt and Rangel Ravelo also homered for St. Louis, which has won five of seven.	Jeimer Candelario homered for the Tigers, who have lost seven of nine. They were coming off a 19-0 loss to Milwaukee on Wednesday, the largest defeat in franchise history.	Jack Flaherty (3-1) allowed four hits in five innings, struck out six and walked two.	Thomas and O'Neill hit two-run homers in a seven-run third that boosted the lead to 9-0.	Goldschmidt hit a solo drive in the fourth to mark his 33rd. birthday. He became the first St. Louis player to homer on his birthday since Randal Grichuk at the Chicago Cubs on Aug. 13, 2016.	Skubal gave up six runs and three hits over two-plus innings.	BUSY BIRDS	St. Louis played its seventh doubleheader this season, including three in six days. They were idle for 16 days earlier this season after 10 players tested positive for COVID-19.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: RHP Johan Oviedo was placed on the injured list after coming into contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Oviedo did not show any symptoms and could return next week. OF Austin Dean was activated from the IL. He had not played this season and was on the IL while following COVID-19 protocols.	UP NEXT	Tigers: Detroit starts a three-game series Friday at the Chicago White Sox. RHP Lucas Giolito (4-2, 3.29) Giolito, who pitched a no-hitter against Pittsburgh, is scheduled to start for Chicago.	Cardinals: RHP Adam Wainwright (4-0, 2.68) is to face visiting Cincinnati and RHP Luis Castillo (1-5, 3.95) in the opener of a three-game series on Friday. Wainwright has won his last two starts. allowing four earned runs over 15 1/3 innings.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  The Oakland Athletics have long been a stellar second-half team. In a shortened season, they have dominated since Day 1.	Sean Manaea carried a perfect game into the sixth inning en route to winning his fourth straight start, Matt Olson hit a two-run homer and the Oakland Athletics beat the stumbling Houston Astros 3-1 on Thursday.	"Big series," Oakland's Mark Canha said. "We came in here with the right mindset. It was very businesslike and we made it happen. Well-played series."	The division-leading A's (27-15) moved 6 1/2 games ahead of second-place Houston in the AL West. The teams split Tuesday's doubleheader that was forced by an Aug. 30 postponement at Houston because of Oakland pitcher Daniel Mengden's positive coronavirus test result.	Oakland had four games postponed and is 5-3 since resuming play last Friday against the Padres. Houston (22-23), which won a majors-best 107 games last season and the past three AL West titles, lost for the eighth time in nine games.	"It's not easy. We're all frustrated," Astros manager Dusty Baker said. "But these guys they never get down. They get down momentarily but then they bounce right back."	The A's have their largest division lead since they were 6 1/2 games up on Sept. 25, 2013.	Manaea (4-2) struck out four and didn't walk a batter over seven innings. The lefty has surged since going 0-2 over his initial five outings. He didn't allow a runner until Josh Reddick doubled leading off the sixth.	"How many rockets did we hit off of him? We hit some balls extremely hard off of him they just didn't find any holes," Baker said. "We actually hit the ball harder than they did. It didn't work."	Chad Pinder provided insurance with an RBI single in the seventh as Oakland took four of five in the series. Liam Hendriks finished the 2-hour, 18-minute game for his 12th save.	Martin Maldonado grounded into a double play that scored Houston's lone run off Manaea in the sixth. Olson connected in the bottom half on another smoky, sunless day that had the strange sight of ballpark lights on in the afternoon. Ash fell on the field for a third straight game.	Astros right-hander Jose Urquidy (0-1) didn't allow a runner until Marcus Semien's one-out walk in the fourth and didn't give up at hit until Canha's single in the fifth.	Urquidy allowed two runs and two hits over six innings in his second big league start.	Houston's George Springer had his season-best nine-game hitting streak snapped.	"Everything was going the other guys' way. Today was disheartening because we hit a lot of balls hard off Manaea," Houston's Josh Reddick said. "It's been very heartbreaking but we have to keep moving forward."	FIVE GAMES	This marked the 15th five-game series in Oakland history. The A's have never swept one but won four of the games in a five-game set for the fourth time and first since July 5-8, 1984, at Milwaukee.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: RHP Justin Verlander (strained forearm) threw a bullpen Wednesday in Houston. Baker was waiting to hear more details about the session and remains optimistic Verlander will return before season's end. The Astros have mapped out the pitcher's rehab schedule for the rest of September. "He's supposed to be on the mound if everything goes well, no setbacks here, again pretty soon," Baker said. "Hopefully if everything goes well he could be back at the end of the month."	Athletics: 3B Matt Chapman still wasn't ready to resume baseball activity as he had hoped. He is nursing right hip tendinitis that forced him out of Sunday's series finale against San Diego. ... LHP A.J. Puk, who hasn't pitched this year and is on the injured list with an inflamed pitching shoulder that required injections, will be re-examined in the coming days by Dr. Neal ElAttrache in Los Angeles.	UP NEXT	Oakland RHP Mike Fiers (4-2, 4.93 ERA) pitches Friday at Texas. He has gone 3-1 with a 3.22 ERA over his last four starts and the A's are 6-2 in his outings. Oakland heads on the road with doubleheaders Saturday at Texas and Monday at Seattle.	Following an off day Friday, LHP Framber Valdez (3-3, 3.61) pitches for the Astros on Saturday in a two-game interleague stop at Dodger Stadium.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Mike Trout hit his major league-leading 16th home run, a 449-foot drive into the second deck in left field, and the Los Angeles Angels beat the Texas Rangers 6-2 Thursday to avoid being swept in six games this season at new Globe Life Field.	Trout, a three-time AL MVP, homered in the fifth inning against Kyle Gibson (1-5) for a 4-1 lead. He has 38 homers against Texas, his second-most against any team behind the 46 he has hit against Seattle.	Angels rookie Jared Walsh homered for the third time in five games, a go-ahead, three-run drive in the first after Trout singled and Anthony Rendon walked with two outs. Walsh finished third in the Triple-A Pacific Coast League with 36 home runs last season for Salt Lake.	Los Angeles (18-27) remained fourth in the AL West, two games ahead of last-place Texas (15-28). The Angels are five games behind the New York Yankees (22-21) for the AL's final playoff spot.	"We should be in better position," manager Joe Maddon said. "We can get hot. We can absolutely get hot."	Dylan Bundy (5-2) allowed two runs and four hits in 7 1/3 innings with a season-high 12 strikeouts and one walk. He fanned four in a row and eight of 11 batters starting with the final out of the second. Bundy began the day with a 2.49 ERA, third-best in the American League, and lowered that to 2.48.	"We faced him last year; he's not the same guy," Rangers manager Chris Woodward said of Bundy, who was 38-45 with a 4.67 ERA in five previous seasons with Baltimore. "Clearly, he's pretty dialed in on his stuff."	Gibson gave up five runs, 10 hits and three walks in 5 2/3 innings. He is 0-3 in five starts since winning Aug. 15 at Coors Field and 0-5 with a 7.18 ERA at Globe Life Field.	"It could have easily been six or seven innings with two runs and we are tied in the ninth," said Gibson, who signed as a free agent last December following six seasons with Minnesota. "I'm trying to be realistic with myself and not be too down on myself even though I am my harshest critic."	Gibson was aided by three double plays behind him during the first four innings. Right fielder Joey Gallo made a running catch deep in the corner to retire Trout in the third inning, then threw to first base to double off Matt Thaiss.	NO-FLY ZONE	When the Rangers put the ball in play against Bundy, all 12 outs were made in the infield. Eleven were grounders plus one lineout to Rendon at third base.	"I didn't know that," Bundy said. "I mean, that's usually a good thing."	SHORT HOPS	The Angels' Taylor Ward singled his first three times up for his first career three-hit game. . The Rangers' Isiah Kiner-Falefa extended his hitting streak to a career-long 13 games with a seventh-inning single. . Albert Pujols and Shohei Ohtani were given the day off by Maddon. ...

TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: INF David Fletcher (left ankle sprain), eligible to come off the injured list Thursday, might play Friday. . OF Justin Upton (bruised left hand) missed his second straight game. He left Tuesday night's series opener after being hit by pitches twice in nearly the same spot in the first four innings.	Rangers: C Jose Trevino (sprained left wrist) didn't play after leaving Wednesday night's game in the middle of a fourth-inning at-bat. With Trevino sidelined, Texas selected the contract of C Sam Huff from its alternate training site, and he is to back up Jeff Mathis. Huff, a seventh-round draftee in 2016, is expected to make his big league debut Friday. OF Scott Heineman was optioned to the alternate site.	UP NEXT	Angels: RHP Griffin Canning (0-3, 4.54 ERA) will take a 4.85 ERA in three road starts this season to Colorado for Friday's series opener.	Rangers: RHP Jordan Lyles (1-4, 8.07 ERA) will seek his first win since Aug. 7 on Friday at home against Oakland in the opener of a four-game series.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ST. LOUIS --  Jeimer Candelario capped off a two-homer day with a two-run, bases-loaded single in the seventh inning to help the Detroit Tigers beat the St. Louis Cardinals 6-3 on Thursday for a doubleheader split.	"We needed that," Detroit manager Ron Gardenhire said. "A good last-inning effort. We had a lot of players stepping up."	The Cardinals won the opener 12-2 behind a five-homer attack.	In the first game, Yadier Molina, wearing uniform No. 21 in honor of Roberto Clemente, hit a go-ahead, two-run homer in the second inning for the Cardinals.	Candelario hit a two-run homer in the first game and added a solo shot in the nightcap.	Jose Cisnero (2-2) picked up the win for the Tigers. Giovanny Gallegos (1-2) took the loss.	Jorge Bonifacio added a two-run homer for Detroit in a late five-run rally. Tommy Edman homered for St. Louis.	The highlight of the Cardinals' six-homer day was Molina's emotional blast.	The normally stoic Molina jumped into the air after passing first base and appeared to wipe away a tear with his uniform sleeve as he approached home plate.	Born in Bayamon, Puerto Rico, Molina was among players from the commonwealth who wore the number as part of Major League Baseball's tributes this week to Clemente, who died when a plane crashed en route to a relief mission in Nicaragua on Dec. 31, 1972.	Molina put St. Louis ahead 2-0 in the second against Tarik Skubal (1-2) with his third home run this season. With his 158th home run for St. Louis, Molina passed Johnny Mize and moved into sole possession of 10th on the Cardinals career list.	Molina has said Clemente was his childhood hero, and Molina received the 2018 Roberto Clemente Award, awarded annually to a player who exemplifies sportsmanship, community involvement and the individual's contribution to his team.	Lane Thomas, Tyler O'Neill, Paul Goldschmidt and Rangel Ravelo also homered for St. Louis.	The Tigers were coming off a 19-0 loss to Milwaukee on Wednesday, the largest defeat in franchise history.	Jack Flaherty (3-1) allowed four hits in five innings, struck out six and walked two. He enjoyed watching Molina succeed on his special day.	"I don't feel like he shows emotion too often," Flaherty said. "But when he hit that home run, he was pretty pumped. That was fun to see. He was fired up."	Thomas and O'Neill hit two-run homers in a seven-run third that boosted the lead to 9-0.	Goldschmidt hit a solo drive in the fourth to mark his 33rd. birthday. He became the first St. Louis player to homer on his birthday since Randal Grichuk at the Chicago Cubs on Aug. 13, 2016.	Skubal gave up six runs and three hits over two-plus innings.	"I didn't do my job," Skubal said.	BUSY BIRDS	St. Louis played its seventh doubleheader this season, including three in six days. They were idle for 16 days earlier this season after 10 players tested positive for COVID-19.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: RHP Johan Oviedo was placed on the injured list after coming into contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Oviedo did not show any symptoms and could return next week. OF Austin Dean was activated from the IL. He had not played this season and was on the IL while following COVID-19 protocols.	UP NEXT	Tigers: Detroit starts a three-game series Friday at the Chicago White Sox. RHP Lucas Giolito (4-2, 3.29) Giolito, who pitched a no-hitter against Pittsburgh, is scheduled to start for Chicago.	Cardinals: RHP Adam Wainwright (4-0, 2.68) is to face visiting Cincinnati and RHP Luis Castillo (1-5, 3.95) in the opener of a three-game series on Friday. Wainwright has won his last two starts. allowing four earned runs over 15 1/3 innings.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

WASHINGTON --  With Ronald Acuna Jr., Freddie Freeman and Marcell Ozuna as the top three hitters in his lineup, Braves manager Brian Snitker knows an early five-run deficit is hardly insurmountable.	Freeman homered twice, Dansby Swanson hit a go-ahead shot in the eighth inning and NL East-leading Atlanta climbed out of a 5-0 hole to beat the Washington Nationals 7-6 on Thursday night.	"That's a rough three guys to start out and go through. To have to go through them three, four times, that's tough duty for a pitcher," Snitker said. "With 27 outs, we're going to put some runs on the board."	Freeman tied the game at 6 in the seventh with a 443-foot, two-run drive to right-center off Will Harris. After a scary bout with COVID-19 during the Braves' summer camp, Freeman is among the major league leaders in OPS. He has five homers and 20 RBI in his past seven games.	"It's the absolute model of consistency and sometimes consistency can be taken for granted," Swanson said. "You get the same out of him every day, every season, no matter if he's hurt or not hurt, dealt with the sickness stuff at the beginning of this year. It's the same every year. ... He really does help us tick."	Swanson's solo shot off Tanner Rainey (1-1) gave the Braves their first lead.	Chris Martin (1-1) worked a scoreless seventh, Shane Greene retired the side in the eighth and Mark Melancon pitched the ninth for his ninth save in 10 chances.	"I would say this is our best win (of the season), to be honest," Freeman said, noting the team didn't arrive in Washington until after 4 a.m. Thursday. "That bullpen, man, it's pretty impressive to watch them every single day."	Acuna also hit a two-run homer for the Braves, who weathered another ineffective outing from their makeshift rotation. Spot starter Robbie Erlin got five outs and allowed five extra-base hits. The final insult was Adam Eaton's two-run homer to the second deck in right-center.	"We thought we could jump on them early, and they might quit, but they didn't. They kept battling back," Eaton said. "They're a good team."	A night earlier, Atlanta starter Tommy Milone allowed eight runs in 3 1/3 innings against Miami, but the Braves set a National League record for runs since 1900  and won 29-9.	Juan Soto reached base four times for the last-place Nationals, who were coming off a two-game sweep of Tampa Bay. A year after winning the World Series, Washington is clinging to faint hopes of sneaking into the expanded playoff field.	Trea Turner had an RBI triple, Soto a run-scoring double and Asdrubal Cabrera an RBI triple in the first.	Huascar Ynoa relieved Erlin and gave the Braves' dangerous offense a chance to claw back. Freeman went deep in the fourth inning after Acuna's leadoff walk. In the fifth, Acuna lofted reliever Wander Suero's first pitch over the wall in right.	"When you hit second, the way we've been swinging it, it feels like I've been getting up every inning. We're all clicking right now, so I don't think it matters where any of us is hitting right now," Freeman said. "Hitting second is pretty much hitting fourth or fifth in this lineup. You're going to get plenty of run-producing situations."	Austin Voth retired the first nine Atlanta batters but only got through the lineup one more time. He was lifted with one out in the fifth after he hit Tyler Flowers on the left arm with a pitch. Voth allowed three runs and two hits with two walks and four strikeouts.	"They're hitting our mistake pitches and that's never what you want right now," Voth said. "They just, they're in a zone."	CLEMENTE DAY 2	Because the Nationals were off Wednesday as Roberto Clemente was honored around baseball, manager Dave Martinez and his coaches wore Clemente's No. 21 on Thursday.	"He's my idol. What he represents is unity," Martinez said. "He means a lot to not only the Latin community but the baseball community, not only as a player but as a humanitarian."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Braves: Flowers was removed in the sixth as a precaution after the catcher was hit by Voth's pitch. Travis d'Arnaud replaced him. ... LHP Cole Hamels (triceps tendinitis), who has yet to pitch this season, was expected to throw at the team's alternate training site and could rejoin the rotation as early as next week, Snitker said.	Nationals: LHP Sean Doolittle walked gingerly off the mound with a right oblique injury after getting one out in the ninth. ... Soto, who rejoined the lineup Tuesday after missing five games with a sore left elbow, is being limited to designated hitter. "We don't know when Juan can throw again," Martinez said.	UP NEXT	Braves: RHP Josh Tomlin (2-2, 3.77 ERA) makes his fifth start since being moved from the bullpen as the four-game series continues Friday. He allowed one run over six innings in a 10-3 win against the Nationals last Sunday.	Nationals: RHP Erick Fedde (1-3, 5.29) allowed four runs in 3 2/3 innings against the Braves last Saturday.	---	Follow Ben Nuckols at https://twitter.com/APBenNuckols	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

CLEVELAND --  Brady Singer's bid at history turned to heartbreak in one pitch.	"I had all the confidence in the world we were going to see it happen," Royals manager Mike Matheny said.	Singer allowed just one hit -- a two-out single to Austin Hedges through an infield shift in the eighth inning -- and the rookie flirted with a baseball rarity while leading Kansas City to a 11-1 win over the Cleveland Indians on Thursday night.	Making just his ninth big league start, the 24-year-old right-hander was four outs from becoming only the 36th rookie to throw a no-hitter when Hedges, who came in batting .148, bounced a single through a wide-open right side.	Kansas City had shifted its infield for the right-handed hitting Hedges, and he found the hole left open when second baseman Nicky Lopez moved.	"I honestly kind of blacked out," Singer said of his reaction. "I saw him get jammed, I saw it kind of get him on the handle. I don't know who was playing there. I didn't turn around and see what the shift was, honestly. But it snuck through. That's how the game works."	Hedges got the hit on a 93 mph full-count fastball on Singer's 116th pitch, and after Matheny came out to visit him,. Singer finished the inning and was warmly greeted by teammates when he got back to Kansas City's dugout.	"I felt really good from the start," Singer said. "It was probably a bad thing, but I kind of noticed there was no hits after the third inning. So it was stressful, but I felt sharp from pitch one and tried to stay focused the whole time."	Singer (2-4) threw 119 pitches, the second-highest total in the majors this season behind the 122 by St. Louis' Adam Wainwright on Aug. 30. Matheny said he was going to let Singer go as long as he needed to finish the no-hitter.	"I just thought that it was going to be a special night," Matheny said. "I was right, but unfortunately, it was just short of being as special as we wanted. Not many guys get an opportunity like that. That was going to be his no matter what."	Hedges, acquired from San Diego on Aug. 31, said he went to the plate determined not to let the Indians get blanked.	"I was just trying to have a good at-bat, see some pitches and wait for a mistake," Hedges said. "And he gave me one of those."	Maikel Franco and Adalberto Mondesi each hit three-run homers and Edward Olivares added a solo shot off Aaron Civale (3-5). The Royals have won three straight since stopping a seven-game losing streak.	Franco also had a two-run single and drove in five runs.	Singer's performance came in his first start after giving up a season-high 10 hits -- all singles -- in a loss to the White Sox on Sept 4.	The Indians have struggled at the plate all season and they spent most of the unusually chilly evening inside Progressive Field either over-swinging or guessing against Singer, who made his major league debut against Cleveland on July 25.	Singer gave up a one-out walk in the first but then retired the Indians with relative ease.	Cleveland had a few close calls: Tyler Naquin flied out to the warning track in right in the fifth, Cesar Hernandez lined out to end the sixth and Francisco Lindor hit a rocket to shortstop Mondesi in the seventh.	The Indians even tried to jinx Singer by putting him on the video board in the sixth inning above the caption: "Currently pitching a no-hitter."	He got through two outs in the eighth but couldn't put away Hedges, who joined Cleveland last week in a trade from San Diego.	Cleveland avoided being shut out with a run in the ninth, but the Indians have scored just two runs in their last 24 innings and Singer made them look inept.	"He kept the ball down, ball in the corner, low pitches borderline, they were giving them to him," said Indians acting manager Sandy Alomar Jr. "He earned those pitches. He has a good arm and he was painting the corners. So you have to give him some kudos."	BIG SHOES	Alomar joked that it would take three hours to describe all the unexpected decisions he's had to make while filling in for Terry Francona.	Alomar credited the team's collaboration and culture in helping offset Francona's absence.	"The players miss him," Alomar said of Francona, who has missed 30 games. "As a student, you can only handle the substitute teacher for so long. You have to bring the real teacher back. It's been fun, but I tell him all the time: `Get your butt back, bro."	TRAINER'S ROOM:	Indians: 3B Jose Ramirez got another day off to rest his sore left thumb. Alomar said the switch-hitting Ramirez has more of an issue when he bats left-handed. The team is hoping some down time and treatment will help Ramirez heal. Entering Thursday, he led the club in homers, RBI and steals.	UP NEXT	Royals: Return home and begin three-game series against Pittsburgh with Kris Bubic (0-5, 4.89 ERA) starting against Pirates left-hander Steve Brault (0-2, 4.37).	Indians: Open key three-game series at Minnesota with ace Shane Bieber (7-0, 1.25 ERA) starting against Twins right-hander Kenta Maeda (4-1, 2,77). Bieber is 2-0 against the Twins in 2020.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

MIAMI --  Starling Marte hit a tying, three-run double off Brandon Workman in the eighth inning, Jorge Alfaro singled home the winning run in the ninth and the Miami Marlins beat the Philadelphia Phillies 7-6 Thursday night in the opener of a seven-game series, the longest in a major league regular season in 53 years.	The series includes three makeup games and two doubleheaders, replacing a series postponed from July 31 to Aug. 2 due to a novel coronavirus outbreak among the Marlins.	The previous seven-game, regular-season series was between the New York Mets and Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field from Aug. 31 to Sept. 3, 1967, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. The Phillies have not played a seven-game, regular-season series since Aug. 16-20, 1930, at the Cubs, a set that included two ties that ended because of darkness in the era before night games.	Miami began a season-high, 15-game homestand and improved the worst home record in the major leagues to 3-9. The Marlins were coming off 29-9 loss to Atlanta.	"It's happened too many times and we've been through a lot," Marlins manager Don Mattingly said. "Every time it looks like these guys will fade, they show up and put up a W and keep it going."	Brian Anderson singled off Workman (1-2) leading off the ninth, and pinch-runner Monte Harrison advanced on Garret Cooper's groundout and stole third on catcher J.T. Realmuto with a headfirst slide, a call by third base umpire David Arrieta play upheld in a video review.	Miguel Rojas was intentionally walked to set up a potential double play, Workman advanced Rojas with a wild pitch and Jazz Chisholm struck out. Alfaro grounded a single up the middle just past the glove of diving shortstop Didi Gregorius for his first big league walk-off hit, giving the Marlins their first walkoff win this season.	Alfaro, who was the first of the Marlins' 18 players to test positive for COVID-19 and was placed on the IL before opening day, has hit .220 with 19 strikeouts in 50 at-bats since returning to action. But he is hitting .292 (7 for 24) over his past seven games.	"Honestly I was looking for something up in the zone that I can drive through the middle," Alfaro said. "I saw the first fastball was up and I took it, so I just waited for something in the spot I was looking for."	Miami (20-19) pulled within a half-game of the Phillies (21-19) for second place in the NL East.	Tommy Hunter allowed three runs in two-thirds of an inning, and Workman one run in one inning. Philadelphia's bullpen has allowed 101 earned runs in 127 1/3 innings, a 7.14 ERA that is the worst in the major leagues.	"I think we've just got to do a better job of attacking guys," Realmuto said. "I think the stuff is there. We're just getting in bad counts, walking leadoff guys with a three-run lead. You can't do stuff like that and be successful late in the game."	Realmuto hit his 11th homer and had an RBI grounder as Philadelphia built a 6-3 lead in the fifth.	Alfaro had his third straight game with multiple RBI for the Marlins.	Phillies starter Jake Arrieta allowed three runs, five hits and four walks in 5 2/3 innings. Marlins starter Sandy Alcantara gave up six runs -- three earned -- and seven hits in six innings, hurt by Alfaro's passed ball and errors by Jesus Aguilar at first and Marte in center.	"It's frustrating for all of us, but the one thing this team's always done is it's bounced back," Phillies manager Joe Girardi said. "We went through this a couple of times this year, and they've got to do it again. It's what they have to do. We don't have a choice."	MOVES	Miami optioned RHP Jordan Yamamoto and LHP Alex Vesia to the alternate training site, and the Marlins recalled INF Isan Diaz and selected the contract of RHP Brett Eibner.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies LHP Jose Alvarez (groin) is starting to take part in light activity, but Girardi doesn't expect him to pitch again in the regular season. Alvarez took a 105.3 mph line drive off the bat of Toronto's Lourdes Gurriel Jr. on Aug. 20.	Marlins: INF Jon Berti (index finger) was placed on the 10-day IL. Berti, batting .250 with 10 RBI and eight steaks, was hurt while attempting a bunt in the 10th inning of Monday's game against the Braves. ... C Francisco Cervelli (concussion) was transferred to the 60-day IL, ending his season.	UP NEXT	Phillies: RHP Aaron Nola (4-3, 2.74 ERA) is scheduled to pitch the first game of the doubleheader. Nola allowed six runs -- three earned -- and struck out 10 in 5 1/3 innings against the Mets last Sunday. No starter was announced for the second game.	Marlins: LHP Trevor Rogers (1-0, 3.00) is scheduled to start the second game. He allowed three runs and struck out 10 in six innings last Sunday against the Rays. No starter was announced for the opener.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

Devers hit a two-run drive in the third and gave Boston a 4-3 lead with a run-scoring single in the seventh off Pete Fairbanks (4-2).	Dalbec's power surge is the longest streak by a Boston rookie.	"It's pretty cool seeing Bobby coming up his first year and doing this," Red Sox manager Ron Roenicke said.. "It's pretty amazing, really."	Hunter Renfroe and Brandon Lowe homered on consecutive pitches for the Rays, who have lost three in a row for the first time since a five-game skid from July 29 to Aug. 2 at Atlanta and Baltimore.	"The big hit, the big pitch has eluded us recently," Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash said.	Tampa Bay's lead was cut to 3 1/2 games over second-place Toronto, and the Rays (28-16) dropped behind Oakland (27-15) for best record in the AL.	"I still think we're in a good position," Lowe said. "I think we've proven we're not going to keep losing."	Tampa Bay struck out 17 times, while the Red Sox had 13.	Ryan Weber (1-2) allowed one run in 2 1/3 innings. Matt Barnes walked Joey Wendle leading off the ninth, allowed a stolen base and a two-out wild pitch, then struck out Austin Meadows with the potential tying run on third for his fifth save in eight chances.	Dalbec put the Red Sox up 3-2 with an opposite-field solo drive off Josh Fleming in the fifth. He became just the fifth player to have at least six homers in his first 10 games.	Tampa Bay tied it at 2 when Renfroe and Lowe homered during the fourth off Mike Kickham. The left-hander, making made his first start since July 1, 2013, for San Francisco, gave up two runs, three hits and one walk and over four innings with eight strikeouts.	"I saw a lot of really bad swings and that means his stuff was good," Roenicke said. "He was throwing that little cutter, his curveball. I thought he was outstanding. "	Meadows got the Rays even at 3 on a fifth-inning RBI double.	Fleming allowed three runs and six hits over 4 1/3 innings in his bid to become the first Rays pitcher to win his first four major league starts.	STOPPING SKIDS	Lowe's homer was his 11th but first since Aug, 26. ... Meadows was hitless in 18 at-bats before his hit in the fifth. ... Boston won for just the third time in its last 15 games against the Rays.	MOVING DAY	Red Sox: INF Jose Peraza was optioned to the alternate training site.	Rays: Acquired INF Pedro Martinez from the Cubs as one of the players to be named in the Aug. 30 trade for Jose Martinez. Martinez is son of pitching great Pedro Martinez.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: RHP Nathan Eovaldi (right calf strain) may be back this weekend. ... RHPs Austin Brice (right lat strain) and Zack Godley (right elbow flexor strain) both went on the 10-day IL.	Rays: RHP Oliver Drake (right biceps tendinitis) threw to hitters and could return this weekend. ...

CHICAGO --  Willson Contreras had four hits to tie a career high, rookie Nico Hoerner added three RBI and the Chicago Cubs overcame an early three-run deficit to top Sonny Gray and the Cincinnati Reds 8-5 Thursday on a long, wet night at Wrigley Field.	Ian Happ drove in two runs and Hoerner, Kris Bryant, Anthony Rizzo and Cameron Maybin each had two hits as the Cubs broke out of an offensive funk and strengthened their grip on first place in the NL Central. Maybin and Contreras each drove in a run and scored twice in a game that started 75 minutes late because of rain and ended after 4 hours, 7 minutes, with 1 a.m. approaching.	"I felt like we haven't come back in a while," Cubs manager David Ross said. "It was nice to see the guys continue to have really good at-bats against a real good pitcher on the mound. Good at-bats, contact, really went a long way."	Contreras and Hoerner, a young utility man, came through with the most timely plate appearances in this one.	The Cubs entered with just a .207 batting average at home, the worst in the majors. Contreras is one of Chicago's few hitters who hasn't been struggling lately.	"He just looks on time every swing," Ross said. "Just really good overall at-bats for Willson and a great night for him.	Six relievers combined for 5 1/3 innings of six-hit ball and allowed only one earned run for the Cubs after Adbert Alzolay permitted three runs on three hits over 3 2/3 innings in his third start this season. Kyle Ryan (1-0) closed out the fourth and got the first out in the fifth to earn the win. Jeremy Jeffress pitched the ninth for his seventh save.	"With Adbert not getting really far, we got some really good innings out of the bullpen," Ross said.	Nick Castellanos tripled to drive in a run against his former team, but the Reds lost for the third time in four games. Brian Goodwin, Jesse Winker, Shogo Akiyama and Tyler Stephenson each had an RBI.	The Cubs rebounded with 13 hits to take the rubber match of the three-game series after the Reds held them to just three in a 3-0 win Wednesday	Hoerner knocked in two runs with a double to start the scoring in a five-run fourth that chased Gray (5-3). The 23-year-old infielder then raced home from second with the go-ahead run on Happ's single that second baseman Mike Moustakas gloved in shallow right field.	Moustakas tried to make a throw from the ground, but Hoerner beat it after relying on third base coach Will Venable to wave him home.	"I didn't look at the ball at all," Hoerner said. "I was just following his signal."	The rally matched Chicago's high for runs in an inning this season.	"That was the inning of the game," Gray said. "That was the one that kind of knocked us down a little bit."	Gray scuffled as his pitch count climbed quickly in his second straight loss. The veteran right-hander was charged with five runs on six hits and three walks.	"I'm not going to sit here and tell you I felt great, but I felt OK," Gray said.	Gray came off his worst outing this season and shortest of his career on Sept. 1 when he allowed six runs in the first inning to St. Louis and got only two outs. His turn in the rotation Thursday had been pushed back from Sunday.	CUBS MOVES	The Cubs optioned RHP Colin Rea to the team's alternate site in South Bend, Indiana, to make roster room for Alzolay. . OF Steven Souza Jr., designated for assignment on Sept. 5, cleared waivers and was granted his release. . Minor league INF Pedro Martinez was traded to Tampa Bay as a player to be named in the Aug. 30 deal for INF/OF Jose Martinez.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: Moustakas started at second, but left in the sixth with a bruised left foot after being hit pitch in the fourth... DH Winker left in the seventh with back tightness. . OF Nick Senzel could return in a matter of days, manager David Bell said. Senzel was placed on the injured list Aug. 19 for an unspecified reason. . LHP Wade Miley (left shoulder sprain) had extra soreness Thursday after a side session Wednesday and "took a step back," Bell said.	Cubs: Bryant was back in the lineup at third base after being held out Wednesday. He was hit by a pitch on the left elbow Tuesday.	UP NEXT	Reds: RHP Luis Castillo (1-5, 3.95 ERA) takes the mound in the opener of a three-game series Friday at St. Louis. The Cardinals counter with Adam Wainwright (4-0, 2.68).	Cubs: LHP Jon Lester (2-2, 5.80) starts the opener of a three-game set at Milwaukee on Friday against Brandon Woodruff (2-3, 3.91). Lester has been roughed up in his last two starts, allowing 10 runs over 8 2/3 innings.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

SAN DIEGO --  The game between San Francisco and the San Diego Padres was postponed minutes before the scheduled first pitch Friday night after someone in the Giants organization tested positive for COVID-19.	Saturday night's game at Petco Park also was called off. The teams were scheduled to play through Sunday.	This was the first postponement due to COVID-19 for both teams. There have been 45 major league games postponed this season because of coronavirus concerns.	Both teams lined up for a moment of silence for the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and then the national anthem. But the Padres didn't take the field and the team announced the game had been postponed.	Players from both teams lingered in and around the dugouts well after Garrett Richards was scheduled to throw the first pitch.	About a half-hour after the game was to have started, the Padres announced the reason for the postponement. A few minutes after that, the Padres filed into the stands for a team meeting.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.

PHOENIX --  Rookie pitcher Riley Smith earned his first career win. Newly acquired reliever Travis Bergen got his first major league save.	The Diamondbacks have a lot of new faces these days after a three-week slump essentially ruined their playoff chances and drove general manager Mike Hazen's decision to overhaul the roster. On Thursday, those newcomers came through to help Arizona earn a rare win against the NL West-leading Los Angeles Dodgers.	Carson Kelly hit a two-run homer, Christian Walker added a two-run double and Arizona snapped a seven-game losing streak to Los Angeles with a 5-2 victory. The Diamondbacks won for just the third time in 21 games overall.	"It was great," Kelly said. "It's been a tough go the last several games, but it felt good to get that W. You never know what's going to happen. We're going to take this, take it into tomorrow and hopefully get on a little bit of a roll."	Arizona starter Madison Bumgarner fought through five decent innings, giving up two runs on back-to-back homers by Corey Seager and AJ Pollock. The veteran left-hander allowed seven hits and two walks while striking out two.	Diamondbacks rookie Daulton Varsho brought home the go-ahead run when his triple scored Nick Ahmed and made it 3-2 in the sixth. Kelly followed with a towering homer to left-center that pushed the lead to 5-2.	"We did a lot of things right," Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said.	Smith (1-0) earned his first career win after throwing 3 1/3 innings of scoreless relief despite issuing five walks. Bergen got two outs for his first big league save.	Dodgers starting pitcher Dustin May was pulled after just one inning after he was hit on the left foot by a sharp grounder.	Diamondbacks leadoff man Josh Rojas smacked the hard-hit ball off May's foot and reached on a single. May limped around for a minute, but remained in the game and finished a scoreless inning. He was warming up for the second when manager Dave Roberts decided to take him out.	The Dodgers called the injury a bruise. It was the second time May had a rough game at Chase Field: Last season, he was hit in the head by a line drive and also had to leave the game.	Roberts hopes May won't be out for an extended period. The manager added that May wanted to stay in but it was a "no-brainer" to take him out since he still had some pain.	"I think tomorrow when we get back home we'll do a CT scan," Roberts said. "We should know more then."	Tony Gonsolin (0-1) took the loss, giving up three runs over five innings.	Los Angeles jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the third after Seager and Pollock went deep. The Diamondbacks came right back in the bottom of the inning when Walker's two-run double -- which scooted just underneath the outstretched glove of third baseman Max Muncy -- tied it 2-all.	Will Smith had four hits for the Dodgers, including three singles and a double.	"Tonight was just a game that just didn't have any rhythm," Roberts said. "It just wasn't a crisp, clean game by us, I think, all the way around."	MOOKIE AT 2B	Dodgers star Mookie Betts made his first start at second base since 2014 and played an error-free game. Betts started 14 games at second as a rookie with the Boston Red Sox. Roberts said the team wanted to get Betts some innings at second base in case there was a late-inning situation in the playoffs where position versatility would be important.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: RHP Walker Buehler was placed on the 10-day IL because of a lingering blister on the index finger of his right hand. He was replaced on the roster by RHP Joe Kelly, who missed the past 27 games with right shoulder inflammation. Kelly will begin serving a five-game suspension that he received for throwing near the head of Houston's Alex Bregman and Carlos Correa.	D-BACKS PART WITH LAMB	The Diamondbacks announced before Thursday's game that former All-Star infielder Jake Lamb had been designated for assignment. The 29-year-old was an NL All-Star in 2017 when he had career highs of 30 homers and 105 RBI. But he's struggled for much of the past three years and was slated to become a free agent in the offseason.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: Los Angeles has a rare Friday off before hosting the Houston Astros on Saturday. The Dodgers will send LHP Julio Urias (3-0, 3.86 ERA) to the mound.	Diamondbacks: LHP Caleb Smith (0-0, 3.00) will make his first start for the Diamondbacks on Friday against the Seattle Mariners. Smith was acquired from the Marlins in a trade on Aug. 31 as part of a deal for outfielder Starling Marte.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

NEW YORK --  This is what Gerrit Cole and the New York Yankees had in mind when they finalized the right-hander's free agent deal last December.	Cole pitched a seven-inning two-hitter, DJ LeMahieu led off the first inning with the first of three Yankees homers and New York beat the Baltimore Orioles 6-0 Friday in a doubleheader opener.	New York moved 2 1/2 games ahead of the Orioles for the AL's final postseason spot as the teams began a four-game series. The Yankees had lost 15 of 21 entering Friday amid a rash of injuries, dropping to third place in the AL East behind Tampa Bay and Toronto.	Cole (5-3) opened with 4 2/3 hitless innings before Hanser Alberto singled, although his effort wouldn't have resulted in a no-hitter regardless. Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent chaired a committee in 1991 that voted unanimously to define no-hitters as games of nine innings or more that ended with no hits. Doubleheaders this year were shortened to a pair of seven-inning games to shorten time in ballparks during this pandemic-shortened season.	"Yeah, I wasn't really thinking about it," Cole said.	The Yankees' $324 million ace struck out nine and walked one, finishing his gem in 114 pitches. He induced 27 swings and misses, the fourth-most of his career, including the postseason, according to MLB.com. He got 11 misses with his fastball and 10 via slider.	Cole tied Cincinnati's Trevor Bauer for the major league lead with two complete games, and neither of Cole's lasted nine innings. The other was a rain-shortened, five-inning effort that beat Washington on opening night. He's (backslash)the first Yankees pitcher with two complete-game wins of less than nine innings in one season since Allie Reynolds in 1952.	"I was happy to be able to finish it for me personally, but also for the rest of the balance of the bullpen for the rest of the day," Cole said. "It's just nice to put a bow on it, I guess."	Renato Nunez got the Orioles' second hit when he singled with two outs in the seventh. Jose Iglesias nearly had a hit for Baltimore in the fourth, but right fielder Clint Frazier dived and caught it.	Cole had lost three straight starts for the first time since 2018, including an outing last Saturday at Baltimore. He's never lost four straight.	"It really just solidified in my mind about all the things, all the intangible things we thought we were getting when we signed him," manager Aaron Boone said about the way Cole handled the stretch.	LeMahieu, Brett Gardner and Kyle Higashioka homered off starter Alex Cobb in his return from the injured list. The right-hander had been sidelined since Aug. 29 for undisclosed reasons. Cobb said postgame he had a cold and stayed away from the team as a coronavirus precaution, although he didn't have COVID-19.	LeMahieu greeted Cobb (1-4) with his fourth leadoff homer this season, tying the Cubs' Ian Happ for the major league lead. Luke Voit singled and Gardner followed with a two-run shot, ending a run of 11 consecutive solo home runs for the slumping Yankees.	Higashioka added his two-run homer in the second. It was the first homer this season for New York's backup catcher, who has been getting more playing time amid Gary Sanchez's struggles. Sanchez was the designated hitter and went 0 for 2 with a walk; his .119 batting average is the lowest in the majors among players with 100 or more plate appearances.	New York hit eight balls at least 90 mph against Cobb over the first two innings, according to MLB's Statcast.	"They weren't necessarily great pitches, but the swings they put on them, I didn't think they were home runs," Cobb said. "I didn't think the swings were home run worthy."	Cobb settled somewhat after that, getting five of his next six outs via strikeout. He was lifted after four innings trailing 5-0.	Mike Tauchman added an RBI single for the Yankees against Thomas Eshelman in the sixth.	The teams played a doubleheader after Thursday's series opener was postponed by rain.	NEVER FORGET	Boone, Gardner and general manager Brian Cashman visited the 9/11 Monument on Friday and laid a wreath on the 19th anniversary of the terrorist attacks. Yankees players and coaches wore NYPD and FDNY hats throughout the doubleheader, and a moment of silence was observed before Game 1.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: Cobb was added to the roster as Baltimore's 29th man for the doubleheader. Manager Brandon Hyde said the team will demote a different player before Saturday.	Yankees: OF Aaron Judge (right calf) and DH Giancarlo Stanton (left hamstring) could report to the team's alternate site for at-bats this weekend, putting them on track to return to the lineup by next weekend. ... LHP James Paxton's status remains unclear following a setback in his recovery from a flexor tendon strain in his throwing arm. Boone said there's "still a chance on some level" that Paxton pitches again this season, and said it's possible the 31-year-old could return as a reliever. Paxton can become a free agent after the season. ... RHP Jonathan Loaisiga (non-COVID, unspecified medical issue) was set to throw a bullpen Friday and another Sunday with the expectation he could rejoin the bullpen Tuesday.

MIAMI --  Aaron Nola gave his seven-inning complete game victory an asterisk.	The right-hander struck out 10 and went the distance for the first time in his career as the Philadelphia Phillies handed the Miami Marlins their worst drubbing in two days, winning a doubleheader opener 11-0 Friday.	Officially, the performance went in the books as a complete game.	"I don't feel like it counts," Nola said. "Nine innings is a complete game. But I felt good today. I'm glad I finished it out."	While Nola cruised, it was another rough outing for Marlins pitchers, who gave up a National League record 29 runs against Atlanta on Wednesday.	Nola (5-3) didn't allow a hit until Brian Anderson singled to cap a 10-pitch at-bat leading off the fifth. By then the Phillies had their 11-run lead.	Andrew McCutchen drove in three runs with three hits, including his sixth  homer. Rhys Hoskins hit a three-run  homer, his 10th. Adam Haseley doubled twice, singled and drove in two runs.	Nola allowed three singles, hit two batters, walked none, threw 106 pitches and reached double digits in strikeouts for the fourth time this year. The complete game was his first in 136 career starts, and he conceded he kept the game ball as a souvenir.	"I might throw with it tomorrow," he said.	Nola lowered his ERA to 2.40 and pitched at least seven innings for the fifth time this year.	"I definitely want to go as long as I can, especially in a doubleheader," he said. "That's kind of our job as starters. We want to take as much stress off the bullpen as possible."	Trevor Rogers (1-1) gave up nine runs, eight earned, in three-plus innings. He struck out five of the first seven batters, but the Phillies broke through with four runs in the third inning.	Haseley doubled and McCutchen homered on consecutive pitches, and Jean Segura added a two-out, two-run double. The Phils added five runs in the fourth, when Hoskins' homer in the fourth made it 9-0.	Miami fell to 3-10 at home.	ROSTER MOVES	Phillies: Before the doubleheader, they selected INF Ronald Torreyes from Lehigh Valley, optioned RHP Connor Brogdon to Lehigh Valley, reinstated LHP Adam Morgan from the IL, and designated INF Neil Walker for assignment.	Marlins: They selected the contract of RHP Johan Quezada. RHP Justin Shafer cleared waivers and was granted his unconditional release.	UP NEXT	Phillies: RHP Spencer Howard (1-2, 5.66) is scheduled to start Saturday in place of Zack Wheeler, whose start was pushed back at least until Monday after he ripped a nail putting on his pants.	Marlins: RHP Jose Urena (0-0, 5.40) is scheduled to start in the fourth game of the series. He allowed three runs in five innings in his first start of the year against Atlanta after being sidelined by the coronavirus.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	---	Follow Steven Wine on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Steve-Wine	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

WASHINGTON --  Michael A. Taylor hit a game-ending single in the 12th inning, and the Washington Nationals beat the Atlanta Braves 8-7 on Friday night after blowing a five-run lead for the second straight game.	Nationals relievers Kyle Finnegan and James Borque (1-0) worked out of bases-loaded jams in the 11th and 12th innings, respectively, and the NL East-leading Braves couldn't score in three extra frames with a runner starting at second base. Atlanta left 22 runners on base in the game.	"A win is a win is a win and when you battle like we did tonight, it was good to come out on top," Nationals manager Dave Martinez said.	Adam Eaton began the 12th on second for Washington and advanced to third on Trea Turner's lineout. Juan Soto was walked intentionally before Grant Dayton (2-1) allowed Taylor's single.	It was the longest game of the season by innings for both teams. Washington jumped out to a 5-0 lead, just like it did Thursday before  Atlanta rallied to win 7-6.	This time, the Braves tied it at 7 by scoring three runs in the ninth with two outs against Daniel Hudson, who blew a save for the fourth time this season.	Juan Soto drove in three runs for last-place Washington, which has won five of seven.	Soto hit a two-run double in the first and the Nationals led 3-0 before Atlanta starter Josh Tomlin recorded an out. His RBI single in the third gave Washington a 5-0 lead.	The Braves lost Ronald Acuna Jr. in the fourth inning when he fouled a ball off his left foot. The team said X-rays showed no fracture.	"They told me it hit a nerve or something," Braves manager Brian Snitker said. "When he did it, he couldn't stand on it. When he got upstairs, X-rays were good. It's a heck of a lot better than when it happened. I'm hoping he'll be able to play. He said it wasn't bad right now."	Marcell Ozuna went 5-for-6 and drove in four runs for the Braves. He hit his team-leading 14th homer in the eighth inning and hit a two-run single in the ninth.	Eric Thames and Yan Gomes homered for Washington.	HOW TO CELEBRATE	The Nationals didn't adhere to social distancing rules while celebrating the walk-off hit, with plenty of high-fives on the field.	"We probably broke some protocol right there," Taylor said. "You have to do the best you can."	STRANDED	"It's not even a small village, it's a small state we left," Snitker said about the runners Atlanta left on base.	DOOLITTLE SIDELINED	Nationals reliever Sean Doolittle (right oblique strain) was placed on the 10-day injured list for the second time this season. The team is awaiting results of an MRI on the 33-year-old left-hander, who was hurt after recording one out in Thursday's loss.	Doolittle had been effective since returning from his earlier stint on the IL with right knee fatigue. He allowed one unearned run in six appearances, lowing his ERA from 15.00 to 5.87.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Braves: LHP Cole Hamels (triceps tendinitis) threw three simulated innings at Atlanta's alternate training site on Friday. Snitker said reports were positive for Hamels, who could join the rotation as early as next week. ... C Tyler Flowers had the night off after being hit by a pitch in his left triceps on Thursday. ... Ender Inciarte replaced Acuna in center field.	Nationals: Recalled LHP Ben Braymer to take Doolittle's spot on the roster. ... Soto (sore left elbow) was again limited to DH.	UP NEXT	Braves: RHP Ian Anderson (2-0, 2.40 ERA) makes his fourth major league start as the four-game series continues Saturday. He lasted a season-low three innings in Atlanta's 5-4 loss to the Marlins on Monday.	Nationals: LHP Patrick Corbin (2-4, 4.34 ERA) allowed five runs on nine hits in 5 1/3 innings against the Braves last Sunday.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

BUFFALO, N.Y. --  Jacob deGrom, wearing an NYPD cap in honor of first responders on the 19th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, pitched six strong innings and the New York Mets backed him in a big way, beating the Toronto Blue Jays 18-1 Friday night.	In addition to the police department, caps for the fire department, Port Authority police, Department of Sanitation and Office of Emergency Management were worn by the Mets.	"Everybody remembers that day and exactly where they were, how much that stopped the world and witnessed how many great men rose to that occasion," Mets manager Luis Rojas, who wore an FDNY hat, said before the game. "It's special for me that to be wearing this. For the people who were directly involved that day. I'm proud and honored just to be representing."	DeGrom (4-1) struck out nine and held the Blue Jays to three hits, two walks and a first-inning run, his 13th straight start allowing no more than two earned runs, the most by a Mets pitcher since Johan Santana in 2008-09.	The two-time NL Cy Young Award winner lowered his ERA to a league-leading 1.67 on a night where the gametime temperature was 61 degrees and fell to the mid-50s by the end.	"Run support is always a plus," said deGrom, who hasn't always gotten a lot of offensive backing. "I wanted them to score as many runs as they could. I did the best I did to stay loose in the dugout. I knew it was cool, so I continued to move around. But there wasn't a time where I thought, `OK this is enough."	Rojas was also glad to see deGrom working at his peak.	"This is the best version of Jake deGrom that I've seen," Rojas said. "Stuff-wise, demeanor-wise, confidence-wise, he wants the ball and he's pushing for this team to keep winning and get into playoff position. He's in a good spot."	Dominic Smith hit his first career grand slam and Wilson Ramos had a three-run double in a 10-run fourth inning. Ramos hit a late solo homer.	"I was just trying to get the runner in from third," Smith said. "I got a good swing on it and it left the ballpark."	Michael Conforto hit a three-run homer as the Mets scored four times in the third.	Erasmo Ramirez worked the final three innings and was credited with his first save since 2017.	Chase Anderson (0-1) allowed four runs in 2 2/3 innings. Former Mets prospect Anthony Kay was tagged four six runs while recording two outs as Toronto had its hold on second place in the AL East trimmed to a half-game over the Yankees, who swept their doubleheader against Baltimore.	"When they're hard fought and tooth-and-nail, extra-inning games and you lose by a run, that might be a little bit tougher to swallow," Anderson said. "This one kind of stings while it happens, but you get to kind of watch it, come back tomorrow and try to even the series up."	Vladimir Guerrero Jr. drove in the Toronto run on a sharp single that Conforto couldn't wrangle against the right field wall.	Conforto, who along with Ramos scored four times, hit his ninth homer to give the Mets a 3-1 lead.	Smith struck for his eighth homer to make it 11-1 and Ramos' double gave the Mets their first 10-run inning since they scored 10 at Philadelphia in the fifth inning of a 24-4 win on Aug. 16, 2018. Ramos added a leadoff homer in the eighth off Toronto reliever Ken Giles, who was activated from the injured list before the game.	TAKE AND GIVE	Toronto, which put up a 10-run inning on Monday against the New York Yankees, became the third team in the expansion era to score and allow 10 or more runs in an inning in a four-game span, according to STATS. The other two occurred in August 2003, when St. Louis and Pittsburgh did it against each other in back-to-back games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: LHP Steven Matz (left shoulder discomfort) threw a side session and is expected to be activated soon. ... Rojas said RHP Dellin Betances (right lat tightness) was responding well to his workout progression.	Blue Jays: SS Bo Bichette (right knee sprain) played in a seven-inning intrasquad game Friday at Toronto's alternate training site and could be activated soon, according to GM Ross Atkins. "The next day depends on his recovery and how he's feeling," Atkins said. ... OF Teoscar Hernandez (strained oblique) did some rotational work and will soon resume baseball activities barring any setbacks.	UP NEXT	Mets RHP Seth Lugo (2-2, 2.05 ERA), who has a 1.54 ERA in his three starts this season with 20 strikeouts, will take the mound on Saturday in the middle-game of the three-game series against Blue Jays LHP Robbie Ray (1-4, 7.51), who was acquired from Arizona at the trade deadline.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Nate Lowe hit two homers and drove in four runs as Tampa Bay fielded a lineup of all lefties, Blake Snell worked 5 1/3 scoreless innings and the AL East-leading Rays routed the cellar-dwelling Boston Red Sox 11-1 on Friday night.	Tampa Bay became the first major league team since at least 1900 to use a batting order with only left-handed hitters, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.	"We had a good time with it," Lowe said.	Rays manager Kevin Cash said there will be no repeat of the all-lefty lineup Saturday with right-handed-hitting shortstop Willy Adames returning from a day off.	Snell (4-1) gave up five hits and two walks. He struck out five.	"He's got nasty stuff," Red Sox manager Ron Roenicke said. "That's why this guy is so good. We had some good at-bats against him, but this is an elite pitcher and it shows."	Yoshi Tsutsugo also homered for the Rays, who stopped a three-game skid. Tampa Bay entered the game trailing Oakland by percentage points for the AL's best record.	"Seeing what the offense can do, that was exciting," Snell said.	Boston rookie Bobby Dalbec had his five-game home run streak end but had an RBI double in the ninth.	The Red Sox would be eliminated from AL East title contention with a loss on Saturday night.	Cash stacked his lineup with lefties against right-hander Andrew Triggs, who made his second start with Boston.	Roenicke appeared to counter quickly by removing Triggs after he allowed a hit and walk in a scoreless first. However, the manager said after the game that Triggs was pulled with a pinched nerve in his neck.	Tsutsugo started the second with a homer off lefty Matt Hall (0-3).	Kevin Kiermaier had an RBI grounder in the third and Austin Meadows hit a two-run double in the fourth.	Hall gave up four runs and six hits over 2 1/3 innings.	Tsutsugo had a run-scoring single before Lowe connected for a three-run drive off Robinson Leyer to put the Rays up 9-0 in the seventh.	Lowe had a solo shot off Domingo Tapia, who made his big league debut, in the sixth and finished with three hits in four at-bats. He entered 1 for 14 on the season.	While some teams have started a lineup in which all batters hit from the left side the first time up, all previous occasions since 1900 included at least one switch-hitter.	Roenicke said when bench coach Jerry Narron gave him the Rays' lineup before the game, he thought it was wrong.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: LHP Josh Taylor (left shoulder tendinitis) was placed on the 10-day injured list.	Rays: SS Willy Adames said he has had issues hitting at home and is wearing non-prescription glasses at the plate. ... C Mike Zunino (left oblique strain) hit in a cage and did defensive drills.	UP NEXT	Red Sox RHP Nathan Eovaldi (2-2), coming back from a right calf strain, is scheduled to face Rays RHP Tyler Glasnow (2-1) on Saturday night.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

NEW YORK --  Pitching, power, savvy on the bases -- the Yankees pummeled the Orioles every which way Friday night.	Gerrit Cole threw a seven-inning two-hitter in a 6-0 doubleheader opener, Luke Voit hit a pair of three-run homers in a 10-1 nightcap romp, and New York thumped Baltimore to win a pair of pivotal games.	DJ LeMahieu, Brett Gardner and Kyle Higashioka each homered in Game 1, and Masahiro Tanaka teamed up with two relievers on a four-hitter for New York in the finale of the doubleheader brought on by Thursday's rainout.	"I thought we played two really complete games, and I think we're going got keep it going," LeMahieu said.	The Yankees moved 3 1/2 games ahead of the Orioles for the AL's final postseason spot as the teams began a four-game series. New York had lost 15 of 21 coming in amid a rash of injuries, dropping to third place in the AL East behind Tampa Bay and Toronto. The Blue Jays fell 18-1 to the Mets, bringing the Yankees within a half-game of second place.	DJ Stewart put Baltimore ahead 1-0 with a solo homer in the first inning of the nightcap, but the Orioles fell apart after that. It started with the defense, which faltered when New York's baserunners turned up the pressure in the bottom half of the inning.	LeMahieu aggressively tagged up to take third on a flyout to left fielder Ryan Mountcastle, then scored on Clint Frazier's groundout to shortstop Jose Iglesias. LeMahieu might have been retired on either play with better throws. Voit then scored easily from second on Gleyber Torres' single when center fielder Cedric Mullins threw well wide of home.	"It wasn't our best inning defensively," Baltimore manager Brandon Hyde said.	Miguel Andujar followed with a two-run double to make it 4-1 as New York chased rookie Keegan Akin (0-1) with two outs in the first.	Voit turned it into a blowout with homers in the fourth and fifth innings against right-hander Asher Wojciechowski. The beefy slugger tied Angels star Mike Trout for the major league lead with 16 homers.	"It's pretty cool, man," Voit said. "The guy's the face of baseball, best player in the game. It's pretty cool to have your name next to him."	This one's cool, too: Voit is the second Yankee to hit three-run homers off the same reliever twice in a game. The other was Babe Ruth, on June 21, 1929 against, Bill Shores of the Philadelphia Athletics.	"What an impact performer he's been," New York manager Aaron Boone said.	Voit has been dealing with a lingering foot injury and limped around the bases after both homers. He was replaced by Mike Ford at first base to start the sixth inning. Voit said the tape on his foot was wrapped a bit too tight.	"I have to be out there with the boys," he said. "And I'll do anything to grind through it."	Tanaka (2-2) allowed a run and three hits over five innings, striking out five on 91 pitches. Luis Cessa and Brooks Kriske each followed with a scoreless inning.	GAME 1	Cole struck out nine and walked one, taking advantage of an early lead after the trio of homers, all against starter Alex Cobb.	Cole (5-3) opened with 4 2/3 hitless innings before Hanser Alberto singled, although his effort wouldn't have counted as a no-hitter regardless because it was a seven-inning game.	Cole tied Cincinnati's Trevor Bauer for the major league lead with two complete games, and neither of Cole's lasted nine innings. The other was a rain-shortened, five-inning effort that beat Washington on opening night.	Cole had lost three straight starts for the first time since 2018, including an outing last Saturday at Baltimore. He's never lost four straight.	"It really just solidified in my mind about all the things, all the intangible things we thought we were getting when we signed him," Boone said about the way Cole handled the stretch.	Cobb (1-4) had been sidelined since Aug. 29 for undisclosed reasons. The right-hander said postgame he had a cold and stayed away from the team as a coronavirus precaution, although he didn't have COVID-19.	LeMahieu greeted Cobb with his fourth leadoff homer this season, tying the Cubs' Ian Happ for the major league lead.	AT HOME	New York clinched its 29th consecutive winning record at home (16-7), the longest streak in the major leagues since the Yankees set the record at 47 years from 1918-64, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.	BUSTING OUT	Yankees catcher Gary Sanchez ended an 0-for-18 skid in the fifth inning of Game 2 with a single off the wall in right field.	FLUSH IT	"Everybody in this locker room knows the significance of this series," Stewart said. "It was a great opportunity for us, and we just didn't come out and execute today. But tomorrow is another day."	NEVER FORGET	Boone, Gardner and general manager Brian Cashman visited the 9/11 Monument on Friday and laid a wreath on the 19th anniversary of the terrorist attacks. Yankees players and coaches wore NYPD and FDNY hats throughout the doubleheader, and a moment of silence was observed before Game 1.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: DH Renato Nunez was hit in the left hand by Tanaka's pitch in the second inning. His hand immediately began to turn black and blue, but he remained in the game. He was sent for X-rays. ... Cobb was added to the roster as Baltimore's 29th man for the doubleheader. Hyde said the team will demote a different player before Saturday.	Yankees: OF Aaron Judge (right calf) and DH Giancarlo Stanton (left hamstring) could report to the team's alternate site for at-bats this weekend, putting them on track to return to the lineup by next weekend. ... LHP James Paxton's status remains unclear following a setback in his recovery from a flexor tendon strain in his throwing arm. It's possible the 31-year-old could return as a reliever. ... Kriske was New York's 29th man.	UP NEXT	Orioles RHP Dean Kremer (1-0, 1.50) goes for a repeat shutdown of the Yankees after he pitched one-run ball over six innings against New York in his major league debut last Sunday. He'll oppose Yankees LHP Jordan Montgomery (2-2, 5.27).	---	Follow Jake Seiner: https://twitter.com/Jake-Seiner	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Kris Bubic worked hard through five innings to earn his first major league win as the Kansas City Royals defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-3 Friday night for their fourth straight victory.	Bubic (1-5), the second of four pitchers from the first round of the 2018 draft to debut for Kansas City in 2020, faced baserunners in every inning, but allowed just one run on six hits in five innings.	"It's obviously pretty fun to know you're in the win column," Bubic said. "But without the team effort tonight, getting the early runs, this doesn't happen. I'm definitely glad to celebrate this."	The 23-year-old lefty won in his eighth big league start. He walked two and struck out six, five of those coming with runners in scoring position.	"He did a nice job limiting the damage," Royals manager Mike Matheny said of Bubic. "That (second) inning, he did a great job of getting the swing and miss when he needed it."	Greg Holland pitched a perfect ninth for his fourth save.	Royals star catcher Salvador Perez came off the injured list and hit a double and single. He had missed the last 20 games with fluid on his left eye.	Adalberto Mondesi homered, scored three runs and stole two bases for the Royals. Maikel Franco hit a pair of RBI singles.	Steven Brault (0-3) allowed three runs on five hits in four innings.	"Too many three-ball counts, scattered the fastball," Pirates manager Derek Shelton said of Brault. "Just overall not being able to command the zone. I think that's the biggest thing. Obviously 97 pitches in four innings, we've got to make sure that we're more efficient than that."	Adam Frazier saw his 12-game hitting streak snapped. It was the longest hitting streak for the Pirates this season.	Mondesi's third home run of the season, all in the last five games, put the Royals up 1-0 in the first. He also extended his hitting streak to eight games, tying his career high.	"I think it's not trying to swing too hard," Mondesi said of his recent success. "When the guy is throwing hard you obviously want to hit the ball hard. I think slowing down my swing and doing more contact has helped."	The Royals got two more runs in the third. Franco hit an RBI single and Perez scored on a wild pitch.	The Pirates cut the lead to 3-1 in the fourth, but Bubic escaped trouble for the second time in three innings. After getting out of a first-and-third jam with no outs in the second by striking out the side, Bubic faced the same situation in the fourth.	He gave up an RBI double to Jacob Stallings, putting runners on second and third, still with no outs. But Bubic then retired the next three batters on an infield popup, a strikeout and a flyout.	"Innings two through four, it's the worst fastball command I've had all year," Bubic said. "But I'm glad to be resilient in those innings and not give in. I had some great defense behind me."	Mondesi scored three runs, the last coming in the seventh when he led off with a walk, stole two bases and scored on Franco's second RBI single.	Josh Bell's two-run homer in the eighth drew the Pirates to within 4-3.	ROSTER MOVES	Pirates: Placed RHP Tyler Bashlor on the 10-day Injured List with lower back inflammation. LHP Austin Davis was recalled.	Royals: Optioned C Maibrys Viloria to the alternate site.	UP NEXT	RHP Trevor Williams (1-6, 5.80 ERA) pitches for the Pirates on Saturday.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Matt Olson delivered in a situation made for a cleanup hitter, at the same place where the Oakland slugger spent his only game this season in the bottom half of the lineup.	Olson connected for a grand slam off Luis Garcia after the Texas opener walked the bases loaded to start the game, and the Athletics beat the Rangers 10-6 on Friday night.	The club leader in RBI was dropped to sixth for a game at Texas when he was slumping late last month. Olson homered among two hits in that 10-3 win, and had two more hits again Friday with a run-scoring single after the slam. His 36 RBI are among the top 10 in the majors, offsetting a .200 batting average.	Olson's 426-foot drive about 15 rows up in right field on a 3-2 pitch was his 13th homer and second grand slam this season. The other was a game-ender against the Los Angeles Angels on opening day.	"His power's been there all year," manager Bob Melvin said. "You look at his average, it's not indicative of how he's played this year. You look at everything else but the average and it would suggest he's having a really good year."	Mike Fiers (5-2) won for the third time in three starts against the Rangers with six solid innings as the AL West-leading A's moved a season-high 13 games over .500 and reduced their magic number for reaching the playoffs to single digits.	Oakland improved to 6-1 against the last-place Rangers, clinching the season series for the fourth consecutive year.	Garcia (0-2) didn't get an out in what was supposed to be the second tandem start for the right-hander with Jordan Lyles. Instead, reliever Jimmy Herget came in after Olson's slam as Garcia's ERA rose from 3.68 to 8.59.	A visit from pitching coach Julio Rangel didn't help Garcia, and manager Chris Woodward popped out of the dugout not long after Olson circled the bases.	"Obviously we'll talk to him, if Julio hasn't already," Woodward said. "You see a lot of left-side misses, kind of pulling them. It's frustrating because obviously Luis has been good for us, but today was not great."	Lyles started the second inning as planned, and Sean Murphy sent his second pitch into the pavilion above the hitting background in center. Murphy's fifth homer of the season traveled 464 feet. Robbie Grossman hit his fifth homer in the sixth.	Fiers gave up one run through six innings before Elvis Andrus homered leading off the seventh and Rougned Odor and Ronald Guzman walked, ending the right-hander's night. Fiers ended up allowing four runs with five strikeouts.	"I'm just disappointed the way it ended," said Fiers, who is 7-0 against Texas in his past 10 starts after going 0-3 in his first six appearances. "Giving up the home run and two walks, I'm going to be disappointed no matter what inning that is. Ended up being closer than it should have been."	Sam Huff made his major league debut and matched Sandy Alomar (2005) and Mark Parent (1991) as the tallest catchers in Rangers history at 6-foot-5. The prized prospect struck out on three pitches in his first at-bat and finished 0 for 3 with a walk. Odor hit a two-run homer in the eighth.	"Take deep breaths, just slow everything down, savor the moment, see how everything's going because you only get one debut," Huff said.	VERY LONG RELIEF	Lyles recovered from a rough second to go seven innings, the longest relief outing in the majors this season. The right-hander allowed nine hits and five runs while throwing 115 pitches, the most for a big league reliever since Jason Johnson threw the same number for Baltimore against the Chicago White Sox in 2000, according to Baseball Reference. It was the longest relief outing for the Rangers in 12 years.	THE GREAT OUTDOORS	The Rangers opened the roof on their new $1.2 billion stadium for the second time -- the first time because of pleasant weather. The first-pitch temperature was 76 degrees. It was 95 degrees when Texas experimented with an open roof in August.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: LHP A.J. Puk will have season-ending surgery on his pitching shoulder. He hasn't pitched this season because of inflammation that required injections. ... 3B Matt Chapman visited a doctor in Vail, Colorado, on Friday for another opinion on his right hip tendinitis. He hasn't played since Sunday.	Rangers: Manager Chris Woodward said C Jose Trevino's sprained left wrist was improving faster than expected and he could return Sunday or Monday. He injured the wrist on a swinging strike Wednesday.	UP NEXT	Oakland RHP Daulton Jefferies is expected to make his major league debut in the first game of a doubleheader scheduled after the A's decided not to play the final game of a four-game series at the Rangers on Aug. 27 to support calls for racial justice. RHP Chris Bassitt (3-2, 3.12 ERA) is set for the second game for the A's.	Rookie reliever Wes Benjamin is scheduled to be another opener for the Rangers, with fellow lefty Kolby Allard (0-5, 7.22) expected to make the other start. It's the first doubleheader of the pandemic-shortened season for the Rangers and the second this week for Oakland.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

CHICAGO --  The Chicago White Sox are one confident bunch right now -- for good reason.	One small opening is enough for Eloy Jimenez and Co.	Jimenez hit a three-run homer in Chicago's four-run sixth inning, and the White Sox beat Detroit 4-3 on Friday night for their seventh straight win against the Tigers.	The AL Central-leading White Sox won for the sixth time in seven games overall, breaking through at the plate after they went hitless in the first five innings against Casey Mize. Evan Marshall (2-1), Codi Heuer and Alex Colome combined for 3 1/3 scoreless innings in relief of Lucas Giolito.	"We are very fortunate in that we have a group of young talented players who thankfully we can see one or the other shine on any given day," manager Rick Renteria said. "That's been the beauty of them in this abbreviated season. You are starting to see the talent perform, to execute."	Going for its first division title since 2008, Chicago improved to 7-1 against Detroit this season. It's the longest win streak for the White Sox against the Tigers since a seven-game run that overlapped the 2005-06 seasons.	"Today was a really good day for us," Jimenez said.	Detroit looked ready to stop the streak when it opened a 3-0 lead in the top of the sixth. Jorge Bonifacio hit a sacrifice fly and Daz Cameron, the son of former big league outfielder Mike Cameron, added a two-run single for his first career hit and RBI.	The rally featured Miguel Cabrera's first stolen base since 2015 and No. 39 for his career. The lumbering 37-year-old slugger swiped third ahead of Cameron's hit, and then celebrated with a dab.	The high-scoring White Sox had been held to just one second-inning walk at that point. But they got to Mize after the young right-hander had to wait through the long top half of the sixth.	"It's so frustrating we didn't get him a win because he pitched so well," Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire said. "That layoff really got him and we worried about that. Sitting there that long inning, which is great for our offense, but not always great for the pitcher."	Nomar Mazara reached on a leadoff walk and Yolmer Sanchez doubled for Chicago's first hit, putting runners on second and third. Mize departed after Nick Madrigal's run-scoring groundout, and Jose Cisnero (2-3) hit Tim Anderson before Jimenez drove a high fastball just over the wall in left for his 12th homer.	"I thought that ball was like 10 rows deep, but it got enough to score three runs," Jimenez said.	Mize, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2018 draft, was charged with two runs in 5 1/3 innings on a cool night. He struck out five and walked two.	"When it comes to the long inning, I'm not going to complain about it," he said. "We scored three runs. I should have done a better job going back out there. I can't walk that first guy after we just took a lead and I ended up giving up a double after that."	Colome worked the ninth for his 10th save, retiring three in a row after Cameron reached on an error.	THE END	White Sox first baseman Jose Abreu went 0 for 4, ending his career-best 22-game hit streak. He had one last chance after Jimenez's two-out single in the eighth, but he bounced to first.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: INF Niko Goodrum (strained right oblique muscle) is swinging and throwing, according to Gardenhire. "Everything seems to be going on the up and up with him," Gardenhire said. ... INF/OF Harold Castro was placed on the 10-day IL last month with a left hamstring strain, but it's his right hamstring that is bothering him now. "We don't know exactly how this is going to turn out and when he'll get back," Gardenhire said.	White Sox: LHP Carlos Rodon (shoulder soreness) has been dealing with some inflammation in his back/rib cage area. "He got some treatment over the last several days and some medication and I believe will be off a mound again on Monday, if I'm not mistaken," general manager Rick Hahn said. ... LHP Aaron Bummer (biceps strain) is progressing, and Hahn said the reliever could rejoin the team during its last road trip of the season.	UP NEXT	Right-handers Michael Fulmer and Reynaldo Lopez pitch on Saturday night. Fulmer (0-1, 8.24 ERA), who missed last season due to Tommy John surgery, is looking for his first win for Detroit since June 14, 2018, against Minnesota. Lopez (0-2, 8.38 ERA) is getting another chance to start for Chicago after he was optioned to the team's alternate training site on Sept. 3.	---	Jay Cohen can be reached at https://twitter.com/jcohenap	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

MILWAUKEE --	The Milwaukee Brewers are starting to get the kind of stellar pitching performances they'll need for a successful late playoff run.	Christian Yelich scored on Ryan Braun's ninth-inning sacrifice fly, Brandon Woodruff pitched seven innings of one-hit ball and the Brewers beat the Chicago Cubs 1-0 on Friday night as they tried to climb back into postseason contention.	"This is our time to go," Woodruff said. "We're going to have to start playing well."	Woodruff, Devin Williams and Josh Hader (1-1) combined on a two-hitter with 16 strikeouts. That followed Corbin Burnes working seven innings and allowing just one hit in a 19-0 rout of Detroit on Wednesday.	The Brewers have pitched consecutive shutouts for the first time since Aug. 31 and Sept. 1 last year against the Cubs at Wrigley Field. Milwaukee pitchers extended their overall scoreless streak to 19 innings.	"If we can find a way to sneak into this postseason, I certainly wouldn't want to face (Woodruff) and Corbin in the first two games of a series," Braun said.	The Brewers were beginning their final homestand as they bid for a third straight postseason appearance, which would be a franchise first.	Milwaukee is third in the NL Central at 20-22, four games back of the division-leading Cubs and one game behind St. Louis. The Brewers started a six-day stretch of eight games against the Cubs and Cardinals.	"It was a great team win for sure tonight," Woodruff said. "We needed that one."	Yelich walked leading off the ninth, and took third on Jedd Gyorko's single to right off Rowan Wick (0-1), just the fourth hit for the Brewers.	Braun greeted Jeremy Jeffress with a fly to right fielder Jason Heyward a few steps in front of the warning track. Yelich scored without a throw.	"Got to make guys swing the bat," Cubs manager David Ross said of the leadoff walk. "It's tough. Tough one there, and you got kind of a jam shot to right from Gyorko."	Former All-Stars Jon Lester and Woodruff matched up in a pitcher's duel following frustrating stretches.	Lester entered with a 5.80 ERA and had allowed at least five earned runs in four of his previous five starts. He had a season-high eight strikeouts and yielded only three hits over six innings against a lineup that had a franchise-record 13 extra-base hits in Wednesday's blowout of the Tigers.	"I don't want to say we reinvented the wheel and we found some magical cure or anything, but the adjustments that we did make in my bullpen, the stuff just translated better and then we continued to work on that leading up to tonight," Lester said. "And obviously the results were good."	Woodruff had lasted just 4 1/3 innings in his prior start, a 4-3 loss at Cleveland, and said "not getting through five innings is kind of a disgrace."	This time, Woodruff allowed his only hit when Ian Happ singled to left center leading off the sixth. Woodruff matched a career high with 12 strikeouts and didn't walk anyone, though he did hit two batters.	"It's not that I'd been pitching bad," Woodruff said. "I just hadn't been pitching the way I want to. I think tonight was getting back to who I am."	Kris Bryant hit a two-out triple in the eighth off the wall in right-center, but Williams struck out Anthony Rizzo. Opposing batters had gone hitless in 31 at-bats against Williams dating to Kyle Schwarber's double on Aug. 14.	CUBS MOVE	The Cubs recalled left-hander Rex Brothers from their alternate training site in South Bend, Indiana. They optioned right-hander Adbert Alzolay to South Bend.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Ross said Jason Kipnis is "dealing with a little something" he didn't specify, explaining why the second baseman hasn't played since Tuesday. Ross said Kipnis will play soon.	UP NEXT	Kyle Hendricks (5-4, 3.41 ERA) starts Saturday for the Cubs and Brett Anderson (2-3, 4.64) for the Brewers.	---	Follow Steve Megargee on Twitter: https://twitter.com/stevemegargee	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

MINNEAPOLIS --  The best pitcher in baseball this season by so many measures, Cleveland's Shane Bieber has made so few mistakes.	Byron Buxton prepared himself for the rare occasion and sent a misplaced slider into the empty seats on the first pitch he saw.	Buxton hit a two-run homer and Kenta Maeda pitched seven shutout innings for Minnesota, as the Twins handed Bieber his first loss of the season on Friday with a 3-1 victory over the Indians.	"He's tough. We got him tonight because we stayed focused," said Buxton, who followed Jake Cave's double in the second with his seventh home run of the season. "That's what it takes to go out there and beat one of the best pitchers in the league."	Bieber (7-1) yielded five hits and two walks with eight strikeouts in seven innings, matching a season-most three runs allowed on the homers by Buxton and rookie Ryan Jeffers. This was the first time the right-hander was taken deep in six starts.	"It really came down to I made two mistakes," said the 25-year-old Bieber, who's quickly become the leader of a stout rotation that has seen Trevor Bauer, Corey Kluber and Mike Clevinger all traded within the last 14 months.	The hitting is another story for the Indians. They've scored three runs in the last 33 innings, continuing a downward trend that began last season. Francisco Lindor batted leadoff for the first time this year, but the Indians didn't get a runner to second base until the ninth. Lindor led off the sixth with a single and was promptly picked off first base.	"I know what we can do as a team offensively. I've been on the wrong end of it many times," said Bieber, whose baseball-best ERA rose from 1.32 to a mere 1.53.	Bieber still became the fastest starting pitcher since 1900 to reach 100 strikeouts in a season, hitting the milestone in 62 1/3 innings, two fewer outs than Washington's Max Scherzer in 2018.	"He's not going to leave a ton of pitches right in the middle of the strike zone," Jeffers said. "So you've got to attack from pitch one, and I think we did a really good job of that."	Taylor Rogers gave up a homer to Jose Ramirez in the ninth, then finished his ninth save. The Twins (28-18) improved to 8-2 in September and 19-5 at their empty home ballpark.	Minnesota stayed one game behind Chicago (28-16) in the American League Central race, pushing Cleveland (26-19) to 2 1/2 games back.	For the second time this week, the Twins played through raw, damp conditions, this time after a 42-minute rain delay. Maeda (5-1) was more than up to the task, allowing just four hits and two walks with seven strikeouts. Maeda, in his first season with Minnesota, has been no slouch, lowering his ERA to 2.43. His walks-and-hits-per-inning rate is the best in baseball.	"I'm trying to fulfill the expectations that the team has for me," Maeda said through an interpreter. "I think I've been doing that pretty well."	WORDS WITH FRIENDS	Sergio Romo pitched a perfect eighth for the Twins, adding some spice to the night when he finished the inning with a flyout by Lindor. The flamboyant Romo was jawing at Lindor as he jogged past along the first-base line, before Lindor charged at him and Romo kept on shouting. Both benches and bullpens emptied, but each team was able to diffuse the tension without incident. The tiff between the players predated this series.	"It's just a couple of players who continually interact with each other when they probably shouldn't," Baldelli said, "and I think it would probably be better if they didn't."	Romo's animated expressions after critical outs have rankled several opponents this season.	"If he's going to dish it, we're going to dish it back. He has to take it," acting Indians manager Sandy Alomar Jr. said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: Ramirez was back in the lineup at 3B, after missing two of the prior three games with a sore thumb. Manager Terry Francona missed his 31st game because of a stomach problem that required surgery and hospitalization, with Alomar Jr. filling in. Francona was in Minnesota on the team's first road trip on Aug. 2 when the illness forced him out of the dugout.	Twins: 2B Luis Arraez was placed on the injured list with tendinitis in his left knee that has bothered him for most of the season. He's 6 for 13 with four runs, three RBI and two doubles this month. Marwin Gonzalez again took his place in the field.	UP NEXT	Indians: RHP Zach Plesac (3-1, 1.32 ERA) pitches on Saturday night. He has walked only two batters in 34 innings this season.	Twins: LHP Rich Hill (1-1, 3.86 ERA) takes the mound for the middle game of the series, his sixth start of the season.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ST. LOUIS --  Luis Castillo pitched a two-hitter for his first complete game in the majors, Joey Votto homered and the Cincinnati Reds beat the St. Louis Cardinals 3-1 Friday night.	Castillo (2-5) struck out six and walked three in winning his second straight start. An All-Star last year, the right-hander made his 87th career start in the big leagues.	"It's marvelous," Castillo said. "To throw nine innings of a baseball game, I'm super, super emotional."	Castillo outpitched Adam Wainwright (4-1), who allowed three runs in six innings. The Cardinals lost for the fourth time in six games.	Only twice did St. Louis get a runner to third against Castillo, who has given up just three earned runs in his past 15 innings.	Castillo retired 13 straight before walking Paul Goldschmidt with two outs in the ninth, then got Brad Miller on a grounder to end it. With the help of a double play in the fifth, Castillo faced one over the minimum in the final six innings.	"It is pretty rare in today's game," Reds manager David Bell said of the complete game. "So it's that much more special. I don't know what was better, seeing him pitch or the smiles. It's great for him. It's great for the team."	Votto hit his seventh home run of the season in the first off Wainwright to give the Reds a 2-0 lead. The two-run drive came on a 3-1 count with one out to drive in Nick Castellanos.	Votto has faced Wainwright 57 times over their long careers, batting .333 with four homers and 11 RBI.	Friday marked the 15th anniversary of Wainwright's big league debut. In the latter part of his career he's adjusted to become more of a finesse pitcher rather than the hard thrower he's been most of his career.	He said the touch wasn't always there Friday, especially in the first when he gave up three hits. All three, including Votto's homer, came off "sloppy" cutters.	"Luckily I had a decent sinker going and nice movement on my fastball," he said. "But my curve ball was horrible. And my cutter, we found out right away, was flat and slow."	Eugenio Suarez doubled in Shogo Akiyama in the Reds third.	Paul DeJong hit an RBI double in the second for St. Louis.	TAKE A WALK, CLIMB THE CHARTS	Cardinals 3B Matt Carpenter drew his 661st career walk in the sixth. That moved him past St. Louis great Rogers Hornsby to seventh on the team's all-time list.	TRAINERS ROOM	Reds: OF/DH Jesse Winkler, who was pulled from the Cincinnati game Thursday against the Cubs, wasn't in the starting lineup on Friday. He's dealing with tightness in his lower back. ... INF Mike Moustakas was out of the lineup after being hit in the left foot in his last game.	Cardinals: RHP Giovanny Gallegos was put on the 10-day injured list with a groin strain. Gallegos (1-2, 3.97) was removed in the seventh inning Thursday after giving up three runs on two hits and a walk, all on 13 pitches, as he took the loss as St. Louis split a doubleheader against Detroit. RHP Nabil Crismatt replaced Gallegos on the active roster.	UP NEXT	Reds: TBD	Cardinals: RHP Dakota Hudson (2-2, 3.19) won his past two decisions, including a 7-5 win at Cincinnati on Aug. 31. He went seven innings, giving up two runs (one earned) and struck out seven in the win against the Reds.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.

MIAMI --  Aaron Nola gives his seven-inning complete game victory an asterisk.	As for the doubleheader nightcap, the Philadelphia Phillies' bullpen remains a big question mark.	Nola struck out 10 and went the distance for the first time in his career as Philadelphia handed the Miami Marlins their worst drubbing in two days, winning Friday's opener 11-0.	The Phillies went with a bullpen game in the nightcap, and their struggling relief corps had another rocky night in a 5-3 loss. Jorge Alfaro had his fourth consecutive two-RBI game  for the Marlins, who scored on three relievers.	Officially, Nola's performance went in the books as a complete game.	"I don't feel like it counts," he said. "Nine innings is a complete game. But I felt good today. I'm glad I finished it out."	With the split, the second-place Phillies remained half a game ahead of the third-place Marlins in the NL East. Miami's split came two days after they got routed 29-9 in Atlanta.	GAME 1	Nola (5-3) didn't allow a hit until Brian Anderson singled to cap a 10-pitch at-bat leading off the fifth. By then the Phillies had their 11-run lead.	"Nola was really good," Miami manager Don Mattingly said. "He wasn't making mistakes that were leaking to the middle. He was on the edges all day."	Andrew McCutchen drove in three runs with three hits, including his sixth  homer. Rhys Hoskins hit a three-run  homer, his 10th. Adam Haseley doubled twice, singled and drove in two runs.	Nola allowed three singles, hit two batters, walked none, threw 106 pitches and reached double digits in strikeouts for the fourth time this year. The complete game was his first in 136 career starts, and he conceded he kept the game ball as a souvenir.	"I might throw with it tomorrow," he said.	Nola lowered his ERA to 2.40 and pitched at least seven innings for the fifth time this year.	"I definitely want to go as long as I can, especially in a doubleheader," he said. "That's kind of our job as starters. We want to take as much stress off the bullpen as possible."	Trevor Rogers (1-1) gave up nine runs, eight earned, in three-plus innings.	GAME 2	Alfaro's two-run single capped a three-run fourth. Lewis Brinson hit his third homer off Heath Hembree, who has allowed six homers in 6 1/3 innings this year.	"His ball is up in the zone," manager Joe Girardi said. "It's just bad misses. He has not been locating very well lately."	Ranger Suarez (0-1), the third of five Philadelphia pitchers, allowed three runs while getting just one out. The Phils' bullpen came into the game with an ERA of 7.14.	Isan Diaz, who opted out early this season and returned to action Friday, put Miami ahead to stay with an RBI single off Suarez.	James Hoyt (2-0) struck out the only batter he faced. Yimi Garcia gave up a run for the first time this season but earned his first save since 2015.	The Phils' Bryce Harper ended an 0-for-18 slump  with a double off Garcia.	MOVES	Phillies: Before the doubleheader, they selected INF Ronald Torreyes from Lehigh Valley, optioned RHP Connor Brogdon to Lehigh Valley, reinstated LHP Adam Morgan from the IL, and designated INF Neil Walker for assignment.	Marlins: They selected the contract of RHP Johan Quezada. RHP Justin Shafer cleared waivers and was granted his unconditional release.	UP NEXT	Phillies: RHP Spencer Howard (1-2, 5.66) is scheduled to start Saturday in place of Zack Wheeler, whose start was pushed back at least until Monday after he ripped a nail putting on his pants.	Marlins: RHP Jose Urena (0-0, 5.40) is scheduled to start in the fourth game of the series. He allowed three runs in five innings in his first start of the year against Atlanta after being sidelined by the coronavirus.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	---	Follow Steven Wine on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Steve-Wine	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

DENVER --  Charlie Blackmon hit a two-out grand slam that capped a five-run rally in the ninth inning and lifted the Colorado Rockies over the Los Angeles Angels 8-4 on Friday night.	Blackmon hammered Jose Quijada's fastball on a 3-1 count over the wall in right center to give Colorado its second walk-off grand slam in franchise history.	Blackmon is fifth in the NL with a .331 batting average but was 7 of 31 in September before hitting his second grand slam of the season and third of his career. It was the fourth walk-off hit overall, three of them homers.	"I really just needed to not make an out. I wasn't trying to hit for extra bases or swing hard. I wanted to make sure when I swung it was in the zone," Blackmon said. "He fell behind in the count and had to throw it over the middle of the plate."	Ryan McMahon's solo home run with one out in the Rockies ninth off Ty Buttrey (1-3) made it 4-all. Josh Fuentes then doubled to right-center and Daniel Murphy was intentionally walked, bringing on Quijada.	"I felt like after I swung on that fastball he was going to come at me with a changeup and I was ready," said McMahon, who hit his seventh homer.	After Trevor Story walked with two outs to load the bases, Blackmon connected. It was Los Angeles' major league-high 13th blown save of the season.	"It's a frustrating part of our season. We've been in this position often and haven't been able to close games," Angels manager Joe Maddon said.	Blackmon finished with five RBI and Story had two hits and three RBI for the Rockies, who are in the chase for the NL's final postseason spot. They are 1 1/2 games behind San Francisco with 15 days remaining in the regular season.	Jared Walsh and Anthony Bemboom homered for the Angels. Walsh and Mike Trout each had two hits.	Bemboom hit a high drive down the right-field line off Daniel Bard (3-2) for his second home run of the season. Jared Walsh tied it at 3 to lead off the eighth with a drive to right-center. The Rockies' bullpen has a 6.71 ERA, which is second-highest in the majors.	The Angels jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the first. A throwing error from shortstop by Story to second on Anthony Rendon's infield single allowed Walsh to score the first run before Justin Upton's RBI single extended the lead.	The Rockies evened it in the third. Story got an RBI double after miscommunication between Trout and Taylor Ward in right-center. Blackmon evened it with a sacrifice fly.	Colorado took a 3-2 lead in the fifth when Raimel Tapia reached on a two-out single and scored on Story's triple to right field. Ward looked like he was going to be able to make a play at the wall, but he banged into it before getting his glove up and the ball bounced off the 14-foot high manual scoreboard.	"I like the way we played. Our guys stayed at it," Rockies manager Bud Black said. "There was an intensity that was present all night. Even though Bard gave up a home run, he got the outs to keep it at one run."	WALKING IT OFF	Colorado's other walk-off grand slam was by Ryan Spilborghs on Aug. 24, 2009, vs. San Francisco. It is the fourth one in the majors this season and first since San Diego's Manny Machado on Aug. 19 against Texas.	FOR STARTERS	Colorado's German Marquez went seven innings for the second straight game. The right-hander allowed two runs on four hits in the first inning, but allowed only two hits and a walk over his final six innings while striking out six.	Griffin Canning went a solid 5 2/3 innings but was plagued by a couple bad plays in the outfield. The right-hander gave up three runs on seven hits with a walk and five strikeouts. He has allowed three or fewer earned runs in six of his nine starts this season.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: David Fletcher (left ankle sprain) is expected to come off the injured list before Saturday's game after he ran the bases and took groundballs without any soreness.	Rockies: IF-OF Chris Owings (left hamstring strain) is taking swings in the batting cage but still can't go full speed running or fielding. ... 2B Brendan Rodgers (right shoulder capsular strain) took some at-bats during a game at the alternate training site but not do any fielding. There is no timetable for his return.	UP NEXT	Angels: Jaime Barria (0-0, 3.38 ERA) makes his third straight start. The right-hander threw a season-high 86 pitches in five innings last Sunday against Houston.	Rockies: Kyle Freeland (2-1, 3.60 ERA) is tied for the NL lead in quality starts with seven. The left-hander has a 3-1 career mark in interleague home games.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

PHOENIX --  Caleb Smith had a miserable start to the abbreviated 2020 season, but it didn't have anything to do with his performance on the field. Instead, he was one of more than a dozen Miami Marlins who was quarantining in separate small hotel rooms after testing positive for COVID-19.	Six weeks and one trade to the Diamondbacks later, he had his successful return.	Smith threw three solid innings in his first outing with Arizona, long reliever Alex Young worked into the ninth and the Diamondbacks beat the Seattle Mariners 4-3 on Friday night.	"It felt great to get back on the field, it's been a long time coming," Smith said. "I'm ecstatic to be with this organization and happy to be where I'm at. I thought I threw the ball decent today, but the most important thing was getting out there and being healthy."	Smith gave up one hit -- Dylan Moore's solo homer in the third -- in his first start since the Diamondbacks acquired him in a trade with the Marlins. The left-hander struck out three and walked one.	The 29-year-old hadn't pitched in a big league game since July 25. He was one of 17 players placed on the Marlins' injured list following the team's COVID-19 outbreak in late July.	Smith said he was only sick for one day but couldn't do any real pitching activity while he spent time in quarantine. It took him a while to get the two negative tests in a row necessary to return and then more time to build back his arm strength.	"You kind of lose your sanity, stuck in a 200-square-foot room," Smith said. "You try to do what you can, move around, watch TV, try to get a workout in, something to pass the time."	The D-backs hope Smith can hold down a spot in their rotation after they traded longtime starter Robbie Ray to the Blue Jays.	Young (2-3) gave up two runs on two hits over 5 1/3 innings and got the first out of the ninth by striking out Kyle Seager. Stefan Crichton retired the last two batters to finish the three-hitter for his first career save.	Seattle's Yusei Kikuchi (2-3) allowed four runs over six innings. The left-hander gave up six hits, walked one and struck out five. He gave up three runs in the first, but was very good over his final five innings.	"I felt like I was getting a little too cute in the early innings there," Kikuchi said through an interpreter. "But the last three or four innings, I went out with a more aggressive mentality just trying to get the fastball going again."	Arizona jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the first. Christian Walker's triple scored Josh Rojas, Eduardo Escobar's sacrifice fly scored Walker and Nick Ahmed's single brought home Kole Calhoun, who hit a double.	"They executed a really good game plan offensively," Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said. "We just pieced things together, had a good approach, our plan was good and we attacked the pitches we were looking for."	The Diamondbacks led 4-1 after six innings. The Mariners got a run-scoring single in the seventh from Jose Marmolejos. Ty France homered in the eighth -- his first with Seattle since being traded from the Padres -- to make it 4-3.	The Mariners had several hard-hit balls that didn't result in hits. Two scorched line drives went straight to third baseman for outs. A handful of deep fly balls were just shy of being homers.	"Really can't fault our guys. Some nights baseball's not fair, and this time was one of those nights," Mariners manager Scott Servais said. "I thought we were right on a lot of pitches, drove some balls very well. Just luck was not on our side."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: Seattle placed 2B Shed Long on the 10-day injured list with a stress fracture in his right shin. The 25-year-old was hitting .171 with three homers. He was replaced on the roster by RHP Brady Lail, who has pitched in four games with the Mariners this season.	MARINERS MOVES	Seattle put starting shortstop J.P. Crawford on the bereavement list on Friday and called up infielder Donovan Walton. The Mariners also put outfielder Mallex Smith on the Triple-A Tacoma roster.

NEW YORK --  The first leadoff, walk-off sacrifice fly in major league history put the New York Yankees back in commanding position for a playoff berth with just over two weeks left in the regular season.	Yes, that's right, Luke Voit LED OFF the 10th inning with a game-ending sacrifice fly.	"It's 2020, man. Things are weird, and you got to take advantage of what opportunities you get," Voit said after the Yankees beat Baltimore 2-1 Saturday to extend their winning streak to four.	Thank this year's rule calling for extra innings to start with a runner on second base. DJ LeMahieu, who made New York's last out of the ninth, went to second and advanced when Hunter Harvey (0-2) bounced his first pitch off the mitt of catcher Pedro Severino to the backstop.	Voit, hitting in shadows that extended to just in front of the mound, worked the count to 2-2, fouled off three pitches and hit a 99-mph fastball to center field. Cedric Mullins made a backhand grab 335 feet from the plate and didn't bother to throw as LeMahieu trotted home leisurely.	Voit, among the major league leaders with 37 RBI, is used to the extra-inning runner rule.	"Playing in the minors for four years, we have that same thing," he said.	Max Muncy of the Los Angeles Dodgers hit the only previous leadoff sacrifice fly in the majors, in the 10th on Aug. 15, but that was in the top half of the inning at Anaheim following Chris Taylor's stolen base. The Dodgers hung on for a 6-5 win.	New York started the shortened season 16-6, plummeted with a 5-16 funk and now is on its longest winning streak since taking six in a row from Aug. 11-17.	"Sometimes what separates good and great teams is you've got to be able to grind through those tough times," Yankees manager Aaron Boone said.	A day after sweeping a doubleheader from Baltimore, New York (25-21) opened a 4 1/2-game lead over the Orioles and Detroit Tigers (both 20-25) for the American League's eighth and final playoff berth and remained a half-game behind Toronto (25-20) for second place in the AL East. After losing three of four at Camden Yards last weekend, the Yankees have outscored the Orioles 18-2 in this series.	"We just chased way too much outside the strike zone," Baltimore manager Brandon Hyde said. "That's why we're streaky."	New York won despite going 0 for 8 with runners in scoring position and making a season-high three errors.	Jonathan Holder (2-0) combined with Jordan Montgomery, Chad Green, Zack Britton and Aroldis Chapman on a four-hitter. Baltimore had a runner on third with one out in the 10th before Mullins lined to second baseman Tyler Wade with the infield in, and Hanser Alberto flied out.	Montgomery struck out a career-high nine, allowing three hits and an unearned run in 5 2/3 innings. Concentrating on not rushing his delivery, Mongtomery got five swings and misses in the first inning. That was two more than during his entire outing Monday against Toronto, when eight of 18 batters reached base against him.	This is the 27-year-old left-hander's first full season following Tommy John surgery in June 2018.	"I'm still getting better, so it's encouraging to be putting together some good games and kind of figuring out where I need to be each game," he said.	Baltimore tied the score in the sixth after Alberto singled leading off and took second when left fielder Brett Gardner bobbled the ball for an error. Alberto tagged up on a flyout and scored when, with the infield in, Ryan Mountcastle hit a pop to short right-center that glanced off the glove of second baseman Thairo Estrada for a single. Estrada backtracked for the ball rather than sprinting after it.	New York had gone ahead in the first when LeMahieu led off with his 200th double, a drive off the wall in left-center, and scored on Clint Frazier's sacrifice fly.	Orioles starter Dean Kremer allowed four hits in five innings and struck out seven after beating the Yankees in his big league debut last weekend by giving up one run and one hit over six innings. A 24-year-old right-hander born in Stockton, California, Kremer has dual citizenship and pitched for Israel in the 2017 World Baseball Classic. He became the first Israeli to play in the major leagues.	With bushy hair protruding from the sides and back of his cap, Kremer had a high pitch count but kept the Yankees off balance with a mix of 29 fastballs at up to 95.8 mph, 27 curves, 24 sinkers and 19 cutters.	"They tried to eliminate my curveball as best as they could," Kremer said. "They did a pretty good job."	STRANGE	Chapman walked awkwardly toward first when Renato Nunez flied to shallow right field starting the ninth, prompting a mound visit from Boone and an athletic trainer. Chapman said he was OK, then laughed as he spoke with catcher Gary Sanchez,	"Mother Nature calls sometimes," Boone said.	MOVES	Orioles: INF Dilson Herrera cleared waivers and was assigned outright to the alternate training site. OF Mason Williams was designated for assignment after Friday's doubleheader.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: 3B Gio Urshela (right elbow bone spur) took batting practice, fielded grounders and is likely to be activated Tuesday, according to Boone. ... OFs Aaron Judge (strained right calf) and Giancarlo Stanton (strained left hamstring) were to head to Scranton this weekend and could be activated next weekend.	UP NEXT	LHP J.A. Happ (1-2, 4.31 ERA) starts Sunday's series finale for the Yankees against LHP John Means (1-3, 6.58 ERA). Happ lost Tuesday against Toronto despite allowing two runs in 6 1/3 innings and striking out a season-high 10.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Rougned Odor and Ronald Guzman homered in a five-run first inning for the Texas Rangers, who beat the Oakland Athletics 5-2 in the first game of a doubleheader Saturday to spoil the major league debut of Daulton Jefferies.	Rangers rookie left-hander Wes Benjamin (1-0) worked four innings for his first big league victory, coming in his fifth game. He struck out four and walked one while allowing two runs after Nick Goody retired the first three batters as an opener.	Rafael Montero worked a perfect seventh for his eight save in as many tries this season, though it was the right-handed closer's first since Sept. 1. The Rangers had won only 10 of their previous 13 games.	Jefferies (0-1), a 25-year-old right-hander who had never pitched above the Double-A level, was called up to be the 29th player for the A's in the doubleheader. He threw 53 pitches over two innings, allowing the five runs on five hits, with one strikeout and two walks.	Jordan Weems pitched three no-hit innings with five strikeouts after replacing Jefferies.	Both Rangers homers came with two outs in the first, with Odor lining a three-run shot down the right field line just a few rows beyond the wall. Elvis Andrus then had a single before Guzman's impressive 431-foot blast  much deeper into the right felt seats.	Odor went deep for the second game in a row, and the fifth time this season, though the homer in the first was only his third hit his last 30 at-bats.	It was the first time the Rangers homered in the first inning of a game at their new ballpark with a retractable roof -- which was closed Saturday, a day after being opened during Oakland's 10-6 win in the series opener. The five runs matched their most in an inning this season, and the most allowed by the A's in a single frame.	The teams played a doubleheader to make up for the game postponed Aug. 27 when the A's decided not to play the finale of a scheduled four-game series to support calls for racial justice.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: All-Star 3B Matt Chapman is expected to miss the rest of the season because of a strained right hip. After not playing since last Sunday, the two-time Gold Glove winner was put on the injured list Saturday and is scheduled to undergo surgery Monday.	Rangers: OF Willie Calhoun, out since Aug. 19 because of a left hamstring strain, likely will be activated from the injured list Tuesday, when the Rangers play at Houston after a day off Monday.	UP NEXT	For the A's, the nightcap of their second doubleheader in five days, with another doubleheader scheduled Monday in Seattle. The Rangers will play twice in one day for the first time this season.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

WASHINGTON --  The Atlanta Braves have one of the best offenses in baseball, yet eventually will need to rely on pitching to get the job done.	Right now, that's coming in form of rookie Ian Anderson.	Anderson allowed one hit over seven scoreless innings and the NL East-leading Braves held on to beat the Washington Nationals 2-1 on Saturday night after closer Mark Melancon escaped a bases-loaded jam in the ninth.	In his fourth career start, Anderson (3-0) allowed his only hit when Asdrubal Cabrera put a bunt down the third baseline. Anderson had a season-high nine strikeouts, allowed three walks and retired the last 12 batters he faced and 18 of the final 19.	"I wasn't entirely happy giving up three walks in the first three innings, "Anderson said after pitching a season-high innings for Braves starters.	Anderson is the second pitcher over the last 120 years to allow one hit or less in two starts of at least six innings in his first four appearances. The 22-year-old right-hander also allowed one hit against the Mets in his debut on Aug. 26.	Melancon earned his 10th save in 11 chances, getting Victor Robles to pop out to right field with the bases loaded.	"I really thought we were going to score in the last inning," said Nationals manager Dave Martinez as the 2019 World Series champs fell further out of expanded playoff picture. "We had our chance there, and it just didn't happen."	After falling behind 5-0 in each of the first two game of the series, Ronald Acuna Jr. had a single, a stolen base, and scored a run on a Marcell Ozuna single in the first inning as Atlanta never looked back. Ozzie Albies' two-out RBI single in the fourth pushed the Braves lead to 2-0.	Adam Eaton came in as a pinch hitter to lead off the eighth against Braves reliever Shane Greene and got the Nationals' second hit of the game on a single to right. He stole second and then scored on a two-out RBI double by Trea Turner.	Washington loaded the bases in the ninth on singles by Cabrera and Eric Thames, and an intentional walk to Eaton, but Robles popped out to right to end the game.	Atlanta has just three shutout wins through 46 games in the coronavirus-shortened season.	Nationals starter Patrick Corbin (2-5) allowed two runs on nine hits while striking out eight. The left-hander has lost his last five decisions, and last-place Washington has posted a 2-7 record in his starts in 2020.	"He gave us seven innings, which is perfect," said Martinez. "We just didn't score any runs for him."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Braves: LHP Cole Hamels (triceps tendinitis) is tentatively slated to make his first start of the season on Wednesday in Baltimore. ... Acuna Jr. was back at the top of the Braves order after leaving Friday night's game in the fourth inning after fouling a ball off his left foot. Acuna Jr. finished 1 for 4 with three strikeouts.	Nationals: Martinez said RHP Tanner Rainey had foreman tightness and will have the next few days off after an MRI came back negative on Friday. ... Martinez gave an update on LHP Sean Doolittle, saying that his right oblique strain was significant and that maybe he could come back if Washington makes the postseason..Eaton was a late scratch with back spasms but entered the game in the eighth.Martinez isn't sure as to his availability Sunday	UP NEXT	Braves: RHP Kyle Wright (0-4, 8.05 ERA) makes his fifth start of the season in the series finale Sunday. He has pitched beyond the fourth inning just once.	Nationals: RHP Max Scherzer (4-2, 3.40) tossed seven shutout innings and struck out eight in his last start against Tampa Bay on Sept. 7.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

MIAMI --  Bryce Harper homered, doubled and reached base five times, leading the Philadelphia Phillies to a 12-6 win over the Miami Marlins on Saturday night.	Harper, who snapped a 1-for-10 funk, also singled and walked twice as the Phillies evened their seven-game series with Miami at 2-2.	"The last couple of weeks my team has picked me up for sure," Harper said. "Everybody was swinging the bats really well. I was just standing there. As an organization, as a whole, these guys have been cheering me on and wanted me to do my best.	"If we're going to be successful as an organization as a team, I have to play better. It's plain and simple."	Didi Gregorius hit his seventh career grand slam, and Kyle Garlick keyed a five-run eighth with a bases-clearing double.	Gregorius gave the Phillies an early lead with his blast in the first. Gregorius drove a slider from Miami starter Jose Urena (0-1) over the wall in right field for his seventh homer of the season.	Harper increased Philadelphia's advantage to 5-0 with a leadoff shot in the third.	"Really encouraging because we're going to need his bat down the stretch," Philadelphia manager Joe Girardi said of Harper. "When a guy that good goes through some struggles, he's going to get hot. We know he can carry a club. He hit balls hard everywhere."	Phillies starter Spencer Howard left with right shoulder stiffness after allowing Brian Anderson's three-run homer in the fourth. The rookie right-hander had kept the Marlins hitless through the first 3 2/3 before Jesus Aguilar singled. Matt Joyce walked and Anderson followed with his sixth homer. Howard walked two and struck out five.	Heath Hembree (3-0) relieved Howard and pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings. Adam Morgan was the Phillies fifth reliever and pitched a scoreless ninth.	Miami closed to within 6-4 on Lewis Brinson's RBI double in the sixth, but the Phillies responded with an infield single by Adam Haseley' that scored Jean Segura from third in the seventh.	"Every time we got anywhere close, it seemed like they ran on us again," Miami manager Don Mattingly said.	Aguilar had three hits, including his sixth homer for Miami.	Urena, who celebrated his 29th birthday Saturday, yielded six runs and five hits. He walked four and struck out two.	REALMUTO REMOVED LATE; SCARY MOMENT FOR HOSKINS:	J.T. Realmuto was removed in the ninth inning as a precaution. Girardi said Realmuto felt hip discomfort	"We'll evaluate him (Sunday) and see where's he at," Girardi. "We just have to see how he is and keep our fingers crossed."	First baseman Rhys Hoskins avoided serious injury when he attempted to catch Realmuto's errant throw on Corey Dickerson's dribbler in the seventh. The throw led toward the baseline, where Hoskins and Dickerson collided. Hoskins favored his left arm and was treated by Phillies training staff but remained in the game.	ANOTHER MAJOR LEAGUE DEBUT:	Reliever Johan Quezada pitched a scoreless ninth and became the 17th Marlin to make his major league debut this season, setting a team record. The previous mark was set in 2010.	TRAINER'S ROOM:	Phillies: LHP Jose Alvarez (testicular contusion) has been throwing from 60 feet and will be re-evaluated Tuesday.	Marlins: SS Miguel Rojas jammed his right middle finger in warm-ups before the game. Rojas singled in two at bats before Jazz Chisolm pinch hit for him in the sixth.	UP NEXT:	Phillies: Zach Eflin (2-1, 4.58) will start one of the doubleheader games against Miami Sunday. The second starter will be determined after all the options have been discussed Girardi said.	Marlins: Rookie right-hander Sixto Sanchez (2-1, 1.80) is scheduled to start one of the games Sunday. Mattingly said it has not been determined yet which end. The second starter will be announced.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

BUFFALO, N.Y. --  Bo Bichette singled and scored in a successful return to the Toronto lineup and Alejandro Kirk also got a hit and scored in his big league debut Saturday night as the Blue Jays beat the New York Mets 3-2.	Bichette, who missed 27 games with a right knee sprain, was activated from the injured list and extended his hitting streak to 10 games. The shortstop is batting .354 this season.	"He was our best hitter when he got hurt," Toronto manager Charlie Montoyo said. "He hasn't lost anything. It's not that easy to lose that much time, come back, and have good at-bats. When he's at the plate, we have a chance. We're happy that he's back."	Kirk, a 21-year old catcher who hadn't played above Single-A, singled in the sixth inning. He also drew a walk.	"Everything was great. The most important thing was that we won the game," Kirk said through an interpreter. "I was kind of nervous in my first at-bat, but right after that everything went back to normal and I felt great the rest of the game."	Robbie Ray (2-4) struck out five over five innings for his first win since being acquired from Arizona in a trade on Aug. 31. He allowed one run and helped Toronto hold its half-game lead over the New York Yankees for second place in the AL East.	Montoyo was especially impressed with the way Kirk and Ray worked together.	"When it comes to catching, that's my main thing," Montoyo said. "Pitching is the name of the game and you have to do a good job behind the plate. The first time, he catches Robbie Ray, they were on the same page. That was outstanding to me."	Rafael Dolis got his fourth save, picking Amed Rosario off first base for the final out. The original call was overturned by the sixth video review of the game.	"From my point of view I was safe," Rosario said. "There were similar calls in the game that were made and they weren't reversed so I don't understand."	"It looked really close," Mets manager Luis Rojas said. "In that situation we don't want that to happen."	Randal Grichuk and Jonathan Villar had RBI singles and Travis Shaw lofted a sacrifice fly for Toronto, which lost to the Mets 18-1 on Friday night.	Rosario had three hits. He struck out in the ninth, but reached first base on a wild pitch.	Seth Lugo (2-3) allowed three runs in 5 1/3 innings.	Jake Marisnick hit an RBI double in the fourth that put the Mets ahead. Toronto tied it in the bottom half.	Bichette led off with a sharp single and appeared to score on Shaw's double, but replays ruled that the ball wedged at the bottom of the wall at right-center. Umpires placed Bichette back at third, and he scored on Grichuk's infield single.	Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit a comebacker and Lugo sprinted to third to narrowly retire Shaw, an outcome verified after another video review.	Toronto grabbed a 2-1 lead in the fifth when Shaw's sacrifice fly scored Kirk, and made it 3-1 in the sixth on Villar's single.	New York got closer in the seventh on an RBI grounder by J.D. Davis.	WELCOME	Kirk batted .290 in 92 games in 2019 at two Class A stops and was added to Toronto's active roster on Friday after spending a couple of weeks on the taxi squad.	0 TO 100 IN (CLUB) RECORD TIME	Toronto's Cavan Biggio drew a walk to load the bases in the sixth inning. It was the 100th free pass of his career and made him the ninth player in MLB history to reach that milestone in 145 or fewer games. The most recent instance was when Carlos Santana drew his 100th walk in his 132nd game in 2011.	Biggio easily set a new Blue Jays record, as Fred McGriff took 182 games to draw 100 walks.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: Marisnick left the game with tightness in his right hamstring, replaced by Brandon Nimmo in the sixth inning. Marisnick spent time on the injured list earlier in the season with a strained left hamstring, and is batting .417 (10 of 24) in eight games since his return on Aug. 28.	Blue Jays: OF Teoscar Hernandez (strained oblique) began to hit off a tee and 1B Rowdy Tellez (knee strain) started riding a bike.	UP NEXT	Mets LHP David Peterson (4-1, 4.26 ERA), who worked two innings in the shortest start of his career on Monday, will start the series finale on Sunday against Blue Jays LHP Hyun Jin Ryu (3-1, 3.19), who has a 1.20 ERA in eight career starts against New York.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Brandon Lowe and Austin Meadows homered and the AL East-leading Tampa Bay Rays beat the last-place Boston Red Sox 5-4 on Saturday night.	Lowe hit a solo shot, his 12th of the season, off Marcus Walden (0-2) in the seventh for a 5-4 lead.	"Hitting a go-ahead homer is awesome," Lowe said.	Tyler Glasnow (3-1) allowed four runs and six hits over seven innings for the Rays, who are a combined 15-4 against the Boston and the New York Yankees.	Diego Castillo worked the ninth to get his fourth save.	Boston, which was eliminated from the AL East title race, got homers from Michael Chavis and Christian Arroyo. The Red Sox stole six bases with Glasnow pitching.	The Red Sox are 2-17 against the Rays, Yankees and Atlanta, and are 14-14 against everyone else.	Arroyo tied it at 4 on his two-run drive in the seventh off Glasnow. The Rays starter had an issue with bleeding on the back of his right thumb that was looked at during the fifth.	"If I don't cut my nails for a while, when I throw my curveball and my heater, it snags the back of my skin," Glasnow said. "I called him (the trainer) out there to put like surgical glue on it and it helps, but apparently MLB has a rule that you can't put anything on a pitcher's (throwing) hand or something."	"So, I was just throwing bloody baseballs during COVID," Glasnow added. "That should probably be a change. I went into the (dugout) tunnel after (the inning) and put like surgical glue on it and it was good. It's fine now, it's cool."	Manuel Margot had a two-run double off Chris Mazza during a three-run fourth that put the Rays up 4-2. Ji-man Choi strained his left hamstring while scoring on Nate Lowe's single earlier in the inning.	Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash said Choi, who will have an MRI on Sunday, is probably going to miss some time.	Margot had two hits in three at-bats and is 14 for 22 in six games against Boston this season.	Meadows hit a leadoff homer off Nathan Eovaldi in the first.	Eovaldi, who had been out since Aug. 21 due to a right calf strain, gave up one run, three hits and struck out four in three innings.	"I felt a grab and thought it would only be a day or two, turned out to be 2/3 weeks," Eovaldi said.	Xander Bogaerts opened the fourth by walking on a 10-pitch at-bat, stealing second and third, and then scoring to give Boston a 2-1 lead on Kevin Plawecki's single.	Chavis tied it at 1 on his third-inning drive.	Boston designated hitter J.D. Martinez was 0 for 4 and is hitless in 21 at-bats.	COOPERSTOWN BOUND	The official lineup card from Friday night's game in which the Rays became the first team since at least 1900 to start nine left-handed batters, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, is being sent to the baseball Hall of Fame.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cash plans to keep CF Kevin Kiermaier (general body soreness) out of the lineup for a couple days. ... SS Willy Adames talked Friday about using clear non-prescription glasses while batting at home but opted not to. He went 0 for 3 with two strikeouts and a walk.	UP NEXT	Red Sox LHP Martin Perez (2-4) will face Tampa Bay RHP Charlie Morton (1-2) in the series finale on Sunday.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

CHICAGO --  Jose Abreu hit a pair of three-run home runs and matched a career high with seven RBI, and the Chicago White Sox beat Detroit 14-0 on Saturday night for their eighth straight win against the Tigers.	Abreu scored five times and went 4 for 4 a day after his career-best 22-game hitting streak ended. It was the longest streak in the majors this season. Tim Anderson also had four hits, and Eloy Jimenez added three for the AL Central-leading White Sox, who have won seven of eight.	Jorge Bonifacio doubled for the Tigers' lone extra-base hit. They have lost eight of 11.	The White Sox, who finished with 19 hits to Detroit's five, are 8-1 against the Tigers this season.	Reynaldo Lopez (1-2) allowed three hits in five shutout innings for the White Sox -- his first scoreless outing since Aug. 25, 2019 against Texas. He was recalled from the team's alternate site Thursday after Dallas Keuchel went on the 10-day injured list with back soreness.	"They sent me there for a reason and I went there with the purpose to work and get better," Lopez said about being optioned Sept. 3. "I was able to do that down there and now I feel like I am in a better place."	Abreu has 17 multihomer games in his career. His last was Aug. 22 against the Cubs, when he hit three.	Abreu hit his first three-run shot off Daniel Norris in the fourth and another against Rony Garcia in the fifth. In his previous 13 games, Abreu homered just once.	"I'm just glad that he's on our team because I can't imagine how difficult it is for the other pitcher to face him," Lopez said.	Nomar Mazara hit a two-run double to extend the White Sox lead to 5-0 in the third and chase Michael Fulmer (0-2), who hasn't won a game since June 14, 2018, before missing last season due to Tommy John surgery. He allowed five runs and nine hits in 2 2/3 innings, raising his ERA to 9.27.	"He wants it so bad," manager Ron Gardenhire said. "Sometimes he muscles up a little too much. He made some good pitches but not enough."	Abreu also singled to drive in a run in the first to help build a 3-0 White Sox lead.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: RHP Jordan Zimmermann (right forearm strain) is expected to move to the bullpen. He returned from the 45-day IL Thursday and allowed an unearned run in three innings against St. Louis in his season debut and possibly final start with Detroit. "We're going to be careful with him," Gardenhire said.	BY THE NUMBERS	Abreu is the first White Sox player to have four hits, two home runs, seven RBI and five runs scored in a game.	HE SAID IT	"Tonight was a lot better than any other start," Fulmer said. "I felt better, pitches were moving a lot better, the command was a lot better, but this game is results oriented and obviously it wasn't very good tonight."	UP NEXT	RHP Jonathan Stiever will start for the White Sox in his major league debut in Sunday's series finale against Detroit and RHP Spencer Turnbull (4-2, 3.32 ERA). Stiever was a fifth-round draft pick in 2018. Turnbull threw six scoreless innings Tuesday against Milwaukee in his most recent start. In his last outing against the White Sox, he gave up three runs in two innings.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

MILWAUKEE --  Jason Heyward hit a three-run homer off Josh Hader in the ninth inning, and the Chicago Cubs topped the Milwaukee Brewers 4-2 on Saturday night.	NL Central-leading Chicago had gone scoreless for 17 straight innings before breaking through against Hader, who hadn't allowed a homer all season long.	"I think that's extremely rewarding as a group and gives you a lot of momentum," Cubs manager David Ross said. "(There's) a lot of positivity, especially going forward, if we want to continue on the championship path that we want to be on."	Javier Baez and pinch-hitter Anthony Rizzo sparked the rally with consecutive one-out singles. Heyward then put the Cubs ahead to stay with a deep drive to center for his sixth homer.	"I was trying to go inside," Hader said. "Obviously I'm not too sure where it went, but I'm going to assume it was probably down and in. Probably a good pitch for him to just drop the barrel on."	Lefties were batting just .115 with six homers against Hader in the All-Star closer's career coming into the game. He hadn't allowed a hit to a lefty all season long before Saturday.	"Balls down the middle are going to get hit, no matter who you are out there," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. "You don't get a pass for those pitches."	After Heyward and company returned to the dugout, Ildemaro Vargas followed with another homer to give Chicago a 4-2 lead. Hader (1-2) then retired the next two batters, but the damage was done.	"These kind of things carry into other games," Ross said. "Where once you've done it, once you've come back, once you've faced one of the best in the game and beat them at the back end when things weren't going well throughout the day."	Milwaukee wasted a strong effort by Brent Suter, who stepped in after Brett Anderson was scratched because of right hip soreness. Suter struck out six in three scoreless innings, and four relievers combined for five innings of three-hit ball before Hader faltered in the ninth.	"For eight innings, we pitched very very well," Counsell said. "Brent did a heck of a job getting us through three innings. ... It went as good as we could have hoped and put ourselves in a good position. It just didn't work out in the end."	Ryan Braun hit a two-run homer for the Brewers, who posted shutout wins in their previous two games. Avisail Garcia, Keston Hiura and Dan Vogelbach had two hits apiece.	Jason Adams (1-1) got one out for the win, striking out Christian Yelich with a runner on first to end the eighth. Craig Kimbrel earned his second save, continuing his turnaround after a rough start to the season.	Hiura and Jedd Gyorko opened the ninth with consecutive singles off Kimbrel. But Vogelbach struck out swinging, Ben Gamel bounced into a forceout and Orlando Arcia lined out to end the game.	While Chicago struggled at the plate for most of the night, Kyle Hendricks kept the Cubs in the game with 7 2/3 solid innings. The right-hander allowed six hits, struck out seven and walked none.	SUTER THE GYMNAST	Suter even threw in a bit of gymnastics in the third. On a 1-0 pitch to Ian Happ, Suter lost his balance and did a perfect somersault off the mound. Cheers came out of the Brewers dugout as he regained his composure and struck out Happ.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: OF Cameron Maybin was scratched due to a stomach illness.	Brewers: The 32-year-old Anderson is day to day. Manager Craig Counsell said he should be ready at some point during the team's five-game series against St. Louis that begins on Monday.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --	Adalberto Mondesi homered and stole a base for the third consecutive game, Kyle Zimmer got his first career win after a winding path to the major leagues and the Kansas City Royals beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 7-4 on Saturday night.	Whit Merrifield added a solo homer and the Royals won their fifth straight game. It was the third consecutive loss for Pittsburgh.	Mondesi and Bobby Abreu in 2004 are the only players to homer and steal a base in three straight games since at least 1901, according to MLB.com.	"He just continues to take great at bats and making things happen," manager Mike Matheny said.	Zimmer (1-0) pitched 2 1/3 scoreless innings, allowing a hit and a walk and striking out one. The 28-year-old was the fifth overall pick in the 2012 draft by Kansas City but didn't debut in the majors until last season due to recurring shoulder issues that threatened to end his career.	"I just got a bunch of milk and barbecue sauce dumped on me," Zimmer said. "It's hard to look back and it's been a long road with a lot of years of grinding, but I just try to stay in the moment."	After struggling through 15 outings last season in his first taste of the majors, Zimmer owns a 1.35 ERA in 13 appearances this season.	Zimmer relieved Carlos Hernandez after the right-hander allowed solo homers by Josh Bell, Bryan Reynolds and Adam Frazier.	"I thought he had really good stuff today," Matheny said. "Even his misses were close misses and there's a few things he needs to continue to work on."	Greg Holland pitched the ninth for his fifth save.	Mondesi tied it at 3 with his two-run homer in the third inning. He has four homers in the past six games after failing to hit one in the first 41 games of the season.	Trevor Williams (1-7) took the loss for the Pirates, allowing 10 hits and six runs in five innings.	"It's just the consistency of execution," Pirates manager Derek Shelton said. "We see it in stretches and then he loses it during the game. We got to get him back on track executing in his zone."	Merrifield led the bottom of the first off with a home run, his ninth on the year.	Salvador Perez hit an RBI single that scored Mondesi after he singled and stole second to put the Royals up 4-3. Olivares and Gordon also had RBI in the fifth to extend the lead to 6-3.	Nicky Lopez picked up an RBI in the seventh off Kyle Crick who walked two batters and gave up two hits in 2/3 of an inning.	Scott Barlow allowed one run on an RBI by Frazier	LATE START	The game was pushed back 30 minutes after an armed man fired shots at nearby Arrowhead Stadium from the parking lot. The suspect was taken into custody.	ROSTER MOVES	Royals: Before the game, INF Kelvin Gutierrez returned from the IL, OF Nick Heath was recalled while INF Ryan McBroom was optioned and INF Matt Reynolds was designated for assignment.	UP NEXT	RHP Chad Kuhl (1-1, 3.38) starts Sunday's matinee for the Pirates against RHP Brad Keller (3-2, 2.60). Keller gave up four runs in 6 2/3 innings in his last outing against the Indians.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Right after the Oakland Athletics bounced back in a big way, the AL West leaders got yet another bit of bad news.	Marcus Semien drove in four runs, Chris Bassitt struck out eight over six innings and the A's beat the Texas Rangers 10-1 on Saturday night to get a split in their doubleheader. That followed a 5-2 loss in the opener, hours after finding out that All-Star third baseman Matt Chapman is having surgery and expected to miss the rest of the season.	"Not a surprise. Whenever we've run into roadblocks we've run into in the past, these guys seem to respond. We did it right away too," A's manager Bob Melvin said, before revealing that infielder Chad Pinder -- one of the players expected to fill in for Chapman -- strained his right hamstring late in the opener and could also be headed to the injured list.	"It was a tough day, and got even tougher," Melvin said.	The first seven A's batters reached base and scored in the second inning of Game 2. That included Semien, the sixth batter whose RBI single chased Kolby Allard (0-6).	Semien, who has played six of seven games since missing five with rib cage inflammation, made it 10-0 with his three-run homer in the fifth.	"It's tough to lose some guys, but know we have depth in the organization," Semien said. "Seems like people are stepping up when they need to, so I think we'll be OK."	Chris Bassitt (4-2) struck out eight and scattered eight hits over six innings in the nightcap. The only run he allowed was on Joey Gallo's ninth homer, a solo shot in the sixth.	Taylor Hearn, who replaced Allard, finally got out of the second with his third strikeout, after he walked two batters with the bases loaded.	The teams played a doubleheader to make up for the game postponed Aug. 27 in Texas when the A's decided not to play the finale of a scheduled four-game series to support calls for racial justice.	In the opener, the Rangers quickly roughed up Daulton Jefferies (0-1) in his big league debut while their own rookie Wes Benjamin (1-0) was getting ready for his first victory.	Benjamin (1-0) was warming up in the bullpen preparing to enter in the second inning of the first game as planned behind an opener when Rougned Odor lined a three-run shot down the right field line before Elvis Andrus had a single and Ronald Guzman hit an impressive 431-foot blast to right for a 5-0 lead.	"I would be lying to you if I said I wasn't thinking about it," Benjamin said. "But at the same time, I try not to look at the scoreboard."	Nick Goody had retired the first three batters as the opener before Benjamin went four innings in his fifth big league game -- all in relief -- with four strikeouts and one walk. Rafael Montero worked a perfect seventh for his eighth save in as many tries this season, his first since Sept. 1.(backslash)	Melvin said Jeffries, a 25-year-old who had never pitched above the Double-A level, "was probably a little amped up. The homers were changeups, probably a little higher velocity than he normally throws."	Jefferies threw 53 pitches over two innings after being called up to be the 29th player for the A's in the doubleheader. Jordan Weems followed with five strikeouts over three no-hit innings.	In between games, Texas shortstop Andrus was put on the injured list with a back strain for the second time this year. Manager Chris Woodward said Andrus was probably done for the season.	ANOTHER DEBUT	INF Sherten Apostel was brought up from the alternate site in between games and made his big league debut starting at third base. He had a fielding error in Oakland's big second, but also had a diving catch on a liner an inning later. Apostel was the eighth player to make his big league debut with Texas this season. He got his first big league hit in the seventh, an inning after Sam Huff -- playing his second big league game -- got his.	DOUBLING UP	The A's played their second doubleheader in the last five days. They played two games at home against Houston on Tuesday, and are scheduled for another doubleheader Monday in Seattle. That will also be 10 games in seven days, their most in a week since 10 games in a seven-day span in June 1966.	CLOSED AND OPEN	The retractable roof at the new Rangers ballpark was closed during the first game, but opened for the night game. It was 84 degrees at first pitch for the nightcap. The roof was also open during Oakland's 10-6 win in the series opener Friday night.	BIG INNINGS	The five-run first for Texas in the first game matched its most runs in an inning this season, and equaled the most allowed by the A's in a single frame. ... Oakland's seven runs in the second inning of Game 2 were the most allowed in an inning by Texas, but not the most scored by the A's. They had a nine-run inning against San Francisco on Aug. 16.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: Chapman is expected to miss the rest of the season because of a strained right hip. The two-time Gold Glove winner hasn't played since last Sunday. He is scheduled to undergo surgery Monday.	UP NEXT	The final meeting of the season between the two teams. Rangers right-hander Lance Lynn (5-2, 2.52 ERA) makes his MLB-leading 11th start, his third against the A's. Frank Montas (3-3) is 1-2 with a 12.27 ERA his last four starts for Oakland.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

LOS ANGELES --  The Astros were whooping it up on the Dodgers' field again, just like they did after winning Game 7 of the 2017 World Series.	In Houston's first visit since being punished for cheating en route to that infamous championship, the Astros rallied with five runs for a 7-5 victory under smoky skies on Saturday night as the Dodgers blew a three-run lead in the ninth.	"That was the win of the year," Astros manager Dusty Baker said. "Hopefully, we look back on this as the turning point of our season."	The Dodgers own the best record in baseball at 32-13. The Astros, on the other hand, are 7-17 on the road after coming in with losses in eight of their previous nine games.	"Things have been very tough, like we haven't had a whole bunch of breaks. We kind of made our breaks today," Baker said. "If we win these two games, the rest of the road trip seems like it doesn't matter."	The Astros knocked closer Kenley Jansen (3-1) around, getting to him on four consecutive hits without an out.	"Just a nightmare, man. This feels terrible," Jansen said. "I'm ahead of the count on everyone and I just didn't execute well."	Carlos Correa and Aledmys Diaz singled, Josh Reddick hit a two-run double and Martin Maldonado added another single. George Springer then grounded into a fielder's choice to third baseman Max Muncy, who committed an error while Reddick scored to tie the game at 5.	Alex Bregman followed with a single to center that made it 6-5. Bregman scored on Yuri Gurriel's sacrifice fly to center off Adam Kolarek for a 7-5 lead.	"For us to be down to the best team in baseball, but for us to string together some at-bats, to come back, to not only actually tie the game, but take the lead and hold it off, was huge for us," Spring said, "especially after a tough trip."	Josh James (1-0) got the victory with 1 1/3 innings of relief. Ryan Pressly earned his ninth save.	The game lacked the fiery emotion of the teams' matchup on July 29. But there were multiple reminders that Dodger fans haven't forgotten the Astros' cheating scandal from their 2017 championship. Houston also visited Dodger Stadium in 2018, but that was before Houston's cheating scheme was revealed.	A plane towed a banner reading "Houston Cheats Bang Bang" over the stadium.	Fans aren't allowed inside this season because of the coronavirus, but a group of Dodger supporters greeted the Astros' bus as it pulled in. They shook large plastic and metal garbage cans in the air, a reference to Houston's sign-stealing scheme that involved signaling pitches by banging on garbage cans.	"I loved it," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said before the game. "They have every right to do whatever they feel to express their feelings. Just shows the passion that Dodger fans have."	Pitcher Joe Kelly honked in support as he drove his black Porsche into the stadium.	The stadium organist got into the act, too. Dieter Ruehle played "Lyin' Eyes," by the Eagles; "The Sign," by Ace of Base; "Bangin' on a Trash Can (Think Big)," by Doug; and "Bang Your Head" by Quiet Riot.	The last time the teams met, Kelly was suspended for throwing pitches that nearly hit multiple Astros batters before he taunted Correa with a pouting expression while walking off the field after the Astros' slugger struck out. Kelly's curled lip has been immortalized in a spray-painted wall mural by an artist in Los Angeles. Kelly is currently serving a five-game suspension.	Chris Taylor and Kike Hernandez slugged back-to-back homers for the Dodgers.	Taylor blasted a two-run shot into the right-field pavilion with two outs in the second, giving Los Angeles a 2-1 lead. Hernandez followed with a solo shot to nearly the same spot in right, the third time the Dodgers have homered back-to-back this season.	Corey Seager tripled off the wall in left-center and scored on AJ Pollock's sacrifice fly in the third.	Seager added a two-out RBI single in the fifth that scored Mookie Betts, who walked and took second on a wild pitch by Framber Valdez.	"We just didn't finish it out," Roberts said.	Houston's other runs came on Gurriel's RBI single in the first and his fielder's choice grounder to second in the eighth.	Valdez gave up five runs and five hits in five innings. The left-hander struck out seven and walked one.	Julio Urias started for the Dodgers, allowing one run and three hits in six innings. He struck out three and walked four.	Both teams did their pre-game workouts inside to limit exposure to the smoke from a nearby wildfire that has been choking the skies over Los Angeles for a week. The scenic view of the San Gabriel Mountains beyond the stadium's outfield was obliterated.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: RHP Justin Verlander (right forearm strain) was due to throw Saturday and next time will face live hitting. ... 2B Jose Altuve (right knee sprain) hit in the batting cage and planned to test his running on the field. He could return next week at home. ... LHP Blake Taylor (left elbow soreness) could return next week. ... RHP Lance McCullers Jr. (neck nerve irritation) is waiting for his condition to calm down so he can return.	Dodgers: RHP Dustin May, who took a line drive off his left foot in Arizona, had a CT scan that revealed a contusion but no fracture. The team has made no decision on either his next start or a possible IL stint. ... RHP Walker Buehler (right hand blister) has played catch with the blister covered. ... 3B Justin Turner (left hamstring strain) will face live hitting Sunday and could return next week on the road trip. ... RHP Pedro Baez (right groin strain) was activated and worked in relief.	UP NEXT	Astros: RHP Zack Greinke (3-1, 3.27 ERA) is coming off his first loss of the season at Oakland. He gave up a season-high four runs and seven hits over six innings.	Dodgers: It will be a bullpen game with four or five pitchers used.	---	The story has been corrected to show Houston also played at Dodger Stadium in 2018.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

MINNEAPOLIS --  With Byron Buxton healthy and again showing his tantalizing talent, the Minnesota Twins are looking more like the strong contenders in the American League they expected to be when this truncated season started.	A return to their power-hitting ways has helped their surge, too.	Buxton homered for the second straight night, Minnesota hit five home runs and Rich Hill got his first win since July in an 8-4 victory against the Cleveland Indians on Saturday.	The Twins won for the ninth time in 11 games since they closed August with a six-game slide. They remained a game back of the AL Central-leading White Sox, who pounded Detroit 14-0.	"You're starting to see a lot of the cylinders starting to click with us as a club," Hill said. "At this time of the season, it's extremely important."	Hill (2-1) struck out seven while working five innings of two-run ball. It was his first win since his first start of the season July 29 against St. Louis.	Buxton's two-run shot deep to the bullpens in left-center field was his eighth of the year and third in four games. Marwin Gonzalez and Willians Astudillo hit consecutive homers off Zach Plesac in the second. Eddie Rosario and Miguel Sano then went back-to-back in the ninth inning for the Twins.	"You think about a 162-game season, right now, it's basically where we'd probably be in the first two or three months of the regular season, like 100-plus at-bats," Rosario said. "That's when everyone starts warming up for a regular season, for 162. Obviously, we're in the middle of this pandemic-shortened season, so right now is when everybody in the regular season starts warming up, so I think everybody's clicking together."	Plesac (3-2) surrendered a season-high five runs in seven innings. He was making his third start since being recalled from the team's alternate training site following a violation of the team's coronavirus protocols.	"I think just early in the game, I wasn't sharp with my command," Plesac said. "I made a couple of mistakes and paid for it."	A year after setting the major league record for home runs in a season, Minnesota's "Bomba Squad" hasn't gone deep with the same regularity, despite adding Josh Donaldson to the mix. But the Twins have shown signs of returning to their powerful 2019 form since Donaldson and Buxton returned from the injured list.	Buxton had one of two homers against Cleveland's Shane Bieber on Friday night, and Minnesota has 21 home runs in its past 11 games. The Twins have hit multiple homers in five straight games.	Jose Ramirez homered for Cleveland for the second straight game, but the Indians dropped their fifth straight. They have scored six runs over their past four games.	"We have to continue pushing," said Indians first base coach Sandy Alomar, who is filling in for the ailing Terry Francona. "We are very fortunate we are where we're at right now, but hopefully tonight it's a step in the right direction with scoring runs."	BACK TO BACK	The pair of back-to-back homers in the game marked the second time in franchise history. The last time Minnesota had two sets of back-to-back home runs in a game was in 1966 against the Kansas City Athletics. Rich Rollins and Zoilo Versalles paired up and then after a ground out, Tony Oliva, Don Mincher and Harmon Killebrew each homered.	ROOKER OUT FOR SEASON	Twins outfielder Brent Rooker was replaced in the fourth inning after being hit by a pitch from Plesac. After the game, manager Rocco Baldelli said Rooker has a fractured forearm and is out for the remainder of the season.	Rooker, the 35th overall draft pick in 2017 by Minnesota, hit .316 with a homer and five RBI in his first seven career games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Twins: RHP Jake Odorizzi (chest contusion) threw five innings on Friday at the team's alternate training site and could be activated from the injured list next week during the upcoming road trip. ... C Mitch Garver (right intercostal strain) is catching at the alternate site and chief baseball officer Derek Falvey said he has "turned a corner." ... OF Max Kepler (left adductor strain) has started taking at-bats in his rehab. ... RHP Homer Bailey, out since Aug. 2 with right biceps tendinitis, has thrown live bullpen sessions and Baldelli said the expectation is Bailey will be ready to return this season. ... C Alex Avila (low back tightness) has taken batting practice during his rehab.	UP NEXT	Minnesota RHP Michael Pineda (1-0, 2.77 ERA) makes his third start of the season Sunday afternoon in the series finale. Cleveland will have rookie RHP Triston McKenzie (2-0, 2.57 ERA) on the mound.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

PHOENIX --  Ty France and Jose Marmolejos hit homers, Justus Sheffield pitched seven quality innings and the Seattle Mariners snapped a three-game losing streak by beating the Arizona Diamondbacks 7-3 on Saturday night.	The Mariners jumped out to a 4-0 lead in the first inning off Arizona starter Zac Gallen, who has been one of the best pitchers in the National League this season. France started the scoring with a solo homer, which was his second in two days. The next three runs came with two outs when Marmolejos hit a run-scoring double and Luis Torrens added a two-run double.	"Nice ballgame all the way around tonight," Mariners manager Scott Servais said. "I thought the pitching side, offensively, we did a lot of good things early in the ballgame. Can't get much better effort than we got out of everyone tonight. Got the results we were looking for, too."	Sheffield (3-3) avoided trouble for most of the night, giving up two runs on five hits. The one exception was the fourth, when the Diamondbacks loaded the bases with no outs. Wyatt Mathisen hit a one-out, two-run single to pull the D-backs within a 5-2 margin, but Sheffield struck out Carson Kelly and retired Pavin Smith on a ground out to end the threat.	The 24-year-old Sheffield has thrown seven innings in back-to-back starts. He struck out seven and walked three on Saturday.	"I feel like the whole game my fastball was, by far, my best pitch tonight," Sheffield said. "I was able to locate inside and that was the plan, to jam them."	Marmolejos hit a two-run homer in the fifth to push the Mariners lead to 7-2. It was the rookie's fifth homer of the season. France is hitting .379 (11-of-29) since coming to the Mariners in a mid-season trade from the Padres.	"Getting consistent at-bats, getting settled at the plate, it's made a huge difference," France said. "To come in and contribute right away feels good."	Gallen (1-2) set a big-league record last week after giving up three runs or less in the first 23 starts of his career. That streak was broken on Monday when he gave up four runs over five innings against the San Francisco Giants.	The right-hander had more trouble against the Mariners, giving up seven runs on seven hits, including two doubles and two homers. He walked five and struck out six, needing 98 pitches to get through five innings.	"This one was a little uncharacteristic," Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said of Gallen's outing. "He had a few misfires early and had trouble getting started. I think he's going to get back on the right track."	30 LOSSES	The Diamondbacks became the first team in the National League with 30 losses, falling to 17-30 for the season.	It's been a disappointing 2020 for Arizona, which expected to be a contender for an NL West title. They made several big moves in the offseason, signing left-handed pitcher Madison Bumgarner to an $85 million, five-year deal, signing power hitting outfielder Kole Calhoun to a two-year deal and trading for center fielder Starling Marte.	They started the season 13-11 but lost 18 of their next 20 to fall out of playoff contention. GM Mike Hazen dealt several veterans at the Aug. 31 trade deadline, including Marte, and the team has called up several young players to see what options they have 2021.	SMITH'S MLB DEBUT	Arizona's Pavin Smith made his big-league debut on Saturday, starting in right field. He got his first career hit in the ninth inning, hitting a ground ball through the left side of the infield for a single.	Smith was the No. 7 overall pick in the 2017 draft after a stellar college career at Virginia. He's the second player from the D-backs' 2017 draft class to make it to the big leagues, joining catcher/outfielder Daulton Varsho.	UP NEXT	Mariners: Seattle wraps up the three-game series with RHP Justin Dunn (3-1, 4.09 ERA) on the mound. He's given up just two earned runs over his past 18 innings.	Diamondbacks: Arizona counters with RHP Luke Weaver (1-6, 7.12). He's started nine games this season but hasn't made it six full innings in any of them. He's averaging just over four innings per start.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

ST. LOUIS --  Dakota Hudson allowed just one hit in six innings and the St. Louis Cardinals backed him with four home runs to beat the Cincinnati Reds 7-1 on Saturday night.	"I thought he had plus-stuff," St. Louis manager Mike Shildt said. "He had good movement. I thought he pitched great. He showed a lot of poise. He didn't give in to anything. He made quality pitches."	Hudson benefited from lots of long balls.	Harrison Bader hit a three-run homer and Matt Carpenter and Paul Goldschmidt added solo drives in the sixth as the Cardinals broke it open.	Brad Miller also homered for St. Louis.	"I'd say we have a lot of guys, myself included, who haven't produced well enough to this point in the year," Carpenter said. "We can all do a better job. I wouldn't call our offense streaky. We just haven't had a full top to bottom production yet. Tonight was a good start and if we can continue that, we'll be headed in the right direction."	Hudson (3-2) won his third consecutive decision and second this season over Cincinnati. He didn't allow a hit through his first five innings. Hudson struck out four and walked four.	"I was in attack mode," Hudson said. "I was pitch efficient."	The Cardinals struck for two runs in the fourth to chase rookie Tejay Antone (0-2). Miller led off with a homer and another run scored on Matt Wieters' grounder.	The Reds, who were checked on just three hits, scored their lone run in the third. Hudson issued three consecutive walks before Shogo Akiyama drove in a run on a fielder's choice. Hudson got Nick Castellanos to hit into an inning-ending double play to quell the threat.	"It was just about bearing down and not giving in," Hudson said. "I had the defense behind me. It was one pitch at a time there. I knew I needed a ground ball there so I could get two outs and get out of that jam."	Reds star Joey Votto was ejected in the ninth after being called out on strikes.	STATS	St. Louis clinched the season series over Cincinnati for the ninth consecutive season. ... The Cardinals (17-0) are the only undefeated team in MLB when scoring five or more runs in a game this season.	HONORING BROCK	A memorial service for Lou Brock was held Saturday in Ferguson. The Hall of Famer died Sept. 6 at the age of 81. After the service, the family led a procession to Busch Stadium where family members laid a wreath at the Lou Brock statue.	ROSTER MOVES	Reds: INF Matt Davidson has cleared waivers and has accepted an outright assignment to the alternate training site.	Cardinals: RHP Ryan Meisinger has cleared waivers and was outrighted to the Cardinals' alternate training site in Springfield.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: OF/DH Jesse Winker (tightness in back) and INF Mike Moustakas (foot contusion) remained out of the starting lineup. Winker was pulled from Thursday's game against the Cubs. Moustakas also was pulled from Thursday's game after being hit on the left foot.	Cardinals: LHP Kwang Hyun Kim (kidney ailment) threw a side session Saturday. It's likely he will return to the rotation and start Monday against the Brewers in one of the doubleheader games.	UP NEXT	Reds: RHP Tyler Mahle (1-2, 3.89) has produced three consecutive quality starts for the second time in his career (1-1, 3.48) with the first time coming in 2018. He has never in his career has produced four straight quality starts.	Cardinals: RHP Carlos Martinez (0-2, 12.27) faced the Twins for the second time this season in his last start. After 41 days on the IL, he worked 3 2/3 innings in a 7-3 loss at Busch Stadium.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.
