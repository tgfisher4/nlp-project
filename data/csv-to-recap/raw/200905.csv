PHILADELPHIA -- Casey Kotchman lofted a short fly to center field in the third inning and angrily slammed his bat to the ground.	He took out his aggression on the Phillies the rest of the game.	Kotchman had three hits and three RBIs, Kenshin Kawakami pitched six effective innings and the Atlanta Braves rallied for a 4-2 victory over Philadelphia on Sunday.	Kotchman hit a two-out, two-run single off Jack Taschner (1-1) in the seventh inning to give the Braves a 3-2 lead. He also had an RBI double in the ninth.	"I'm just trying to make the most of the opportunities I get," said Kotchman, who went 3-for-5 to raise his average to .312.	Garret Anderson had two hits for the Braves (15-16), who took two of three from the Phillies to move within one game of .500. Rafael Soriano worked the ninth for his third save in three opportunities.	Matt Stairs got a rare start for Philadelphia and went 2-for-2 with a run-scoring double and a walk. Ryan Howard also had a pair of doubles and scored two runs.	The Phillies fell to 0-10 when scoring three runs or less.	"We definitely have to play better," manager Charlie Manuel said. "We have to be more consistent. We haven't put it together like we want to."	Kawakami (2-4) allowed two runs and five hits, struck out six and walked four. The 33-year-old rookie, a six-time All-Star in Japan, picked up his first win in nearly a month.	"Kawakami pitched a gutsy game," Braves manager Bobby Cox said. "He had great stuff and kept the left-handers off balance."	Brett Myers turned in a solid outing for Philadelphia, yielding one run and five hits despite hitting two batters. He was lifted for pinch-hitter Greg Dobbs in the bottom of the sixth despite throwing only 92 pitches.	"I felt a little better and had more control than in the past," Myers said. "I felt stronger."	Myers helped end Chipper Jones' 29-game hitting streak against the Phillies. Jones was 0-for-3 with a walk, marking the first time since April 5, 2007, that he failed to register a hit against Philadelphia. Jones' streak was the longest by a Braves player against another team since 1954.	Jones left in the seventh with a sore elbow and is listed as day to day.	"I couldn't throw across the infield," Jones said. "I'll see how it feels [Monday]. If I can play, I'll play."	The Braves loaded the bases with no outs in the first but managed just one run on a sacrifice fly to center by Anderson.	Pedro Feliz tied it with an RBI single in the second.	Game notes	 Philadelphia C Carlos Ruiz started after sitting out the previous two games with a strained right oblique. ... The game drew a sellout crowd of 45,343 and the weekend series attracted 135,994, a record for a three-game series at Citizens Bank Park. ... Philadelphia's Shane Victorino was 0 for 13 in the three-game series. ... Atlanta's Jeff Francoeur was hitless in five at-bats, snapping his season-high 10-game hitting streak.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CINCINNATI -- Ryan Franklin was dumbfounded.	As he watched Reds pitcher Micah Owings round the bases on his two-out, pinch-hit homer in the ninth, the previously perfect St. Louis closer was reminded that there's no margin for error at Great American Ball Park.	"That's an out anywhere else," Franklin said of the solo homer that barely cleared the left-field wall. "That's what happens."	All sorts of things happened on a very long day in Cincinnati.	The Reds hit five homers, including two solo shots in the ninth off Franklin (1-0) to tie it, but Colby Rasmus' double in the 10th inning sent St. Louis to an 8-7 victory Sunday that salvaged the final game of the series and left everyone agog over what had just happened.	"That was a blast," said Jay Bruce, who hit one of the Reds' five homers.	It was dramatic right down to the 401st and final pitch -- Paul Janish fouled out with the bases loaded to end it after 4 hours, 23 minutes.	"What a game," Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said. "Good luck asking me questions because I don't remember much of anything except a 1-2 slider that Janish popped up. I can't think of anything else that happened, really."	Everyone was a bit numb.	Coming into the series, St. Louis' staff had given up only 11 homers, the fewest in the majors. The Reds hit seven in the last two games, including those two in the ninth that got the crowd of 27,664 revved.	Jerry Hairston Jr. led off with a full-count homer. Owings, the Reds' fifth starter and one of their top pinch hitters, came to the plate with two outs, worked the count full, fouled off three pitches, then hit a slider for his first homer.	Owings raised his right arm in triumph as he rounded second base on his sixth career homer. He was pummeled in the dugout by teammates and took a curtain call for the fans.	"That's like what you do in the backyard -- 3-2, bottom of the ninth," Bruce said. "We were jumping around in the dugout. It was awesome."	Franklin hadn't allowed a run all season and had given up only four hits in his previous 13 2-3 innings.	"I had a good run there," he said. "I made two mistakes, pretty much."	Rasmus quickly changed the mood with his RBI double off Francisco Cordero (0-2), who is perfect in nine save chances but has lost twice when pitching with the score tied.	Over? Not even close.	Cincinnati loaded the bases with two outs in the 10th against Blaine Boyer. Right-hander Chris Perez came on and got Janish to foul out, picking up his first save in two chances this season.	For the first time all weekend, the Cardinals could smile.	"That was really important," said Chris Duncan, who drove in three runs. "We didn't want to get swept."	Bruce, Adam Rosales and Joey Votto also homered for the Reds, who had won three in a row for their best record in three years. Votto was out of the starting lineup for the fourth straight game because of the flu, but had a pinch-hit homer off Kyle McClellan.	The Cardinals ended Edinson Volquez's scoreless-inning streak at 16 -- he let in a run in the first with his errant throw -- and scored seven times off the right-hander. Skip Schumaker had a pair of doubles and scored twice for the Cardinals, and Duncan drove in three runs with a double and a single.	Albert Pujols' solo homer off Volquez snapped his 0-for-11 drought. Pujols' 12th homer was his only hit during the three-game series.	Game notes	 It was Pujols' 14th career homer at Great American, trailing only Lance Berkman's 20 for the most by a visiting player. ... Reds SS Alex Gonzalez missed his sixth game with pulled side muscles. The Reds will likely make a decision in the next couple days about whether to put him on the DL. He resumed baseball activities over the weekend. ... Bruce and Willy Taveras extended their hitting streaks to 11 games.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK -- The Mets have gotten plenty of good pitching during their seven-game win streak, and at the plate, it's almost as if New York hitters know what's coming.	On Sunday, Pirates starter Ian Snell thought perhaps they did.	Carlos Beltran, Luis Castillo and Omir Santos each drove in a pair of runs, and the Mets rolled to an 8-4 victory over bumbling Pittsburgh and their first three-game sweep of the Pirates since 2001. The win gave New York seven straight victories for the first time since last July.	"They hit some good pitches. I found out later they had our signs," said Snell, who lost for the fifth time in seven starts. "That's baseball -- there's nothing wrong with it."	Snell said he thinks David Wright may have had the signs when he fouled off a couple of good pitches in the fourth inning, when New York scored three times to take a 3-2 lead.	"Like he was expecting them," Snell said.	The three-game sweep was the first for New York after failing in three previous attempts this season. The Mets, who welcomed back manager Jerry Manuel from a one-game suspension, haven't lost since May 2.	"I think we just needed to get hot a little bit to realize how good we are," Wright said.	Livan Hernandez (3-1) needed 31 pitches to get through a shaky first, but settled down to last six innings. He allowed two runs and seven hits for his 150th career win. Every Mets starter has gone at least six innings during their win streak, and they're a combined 6-0 with a 2.26 ERA.	"We're playing good baseball, especially our starting pitching -- to go six, seven innings gives our bullpen a rest," said Wright, who's hitting .356 over his last 12 games. "We feel pretty comfortable when we put up a couple crooked numbers we're going to win the game."	Nate McLouth hit a two-run homer in the ninth and finished with three RBIs for the Pirates, who have dropped eight in a row and 12 of 13 after an 11-7 start to the season.	The Pirates hadn't been swept by the Mets since Sept. 17-19, 2001, and it had not happened in New York since June 2000.	"We're struggling to score runs. We can't afford to give up so many late," manager John Russell said. "Hopefully we can go home and refocus."	Snell (1-5) did his best to give Pittsburgh a chance, cruising into the fourth with a mid-90s fastball. Carlos Delgado finally gave New York some life with a double that hit a couple feet below the top of the center-field wall -- a home run in just about any other park in the majors -- and Wright followed with an RBI single.	After Daniel Murphy walked, Santos brought them both home with a base hit.	The Mets added to their 3-2 lead in the seventh, taking advantage of an error by shortstop Brian Bixler. They tacked on four more in the eighth when Jose Reyes drew a bases-loaded walk, Castillo hit a sacrifice fly and Beltran drove a two-run double off the left-field wall.	"We're pretty good at scoring early, but last year we had trouble scoring late," said Beltran, who has six RBIs in his last four games. "Now we're doing everything the way we should do it."	Snell can't seem to catch a break, although nobody else on the Pirates can either.	The 27-year-old right-hander has only allowed nine runs his last five starts but has one win to show for it. His last time out, he threw 131 pitches over seven innings and allowed the only run in a 1-0 loss to the Brewers.	"They had a very talented guy pitching on the mound," Manuel said. "Getting runs from the bottom of the order is good to see, and that's what we did today."	Game notes	 Several players used pink bats for Mother's Day and breast cancer awareness. The bats will be auctioned to raise money for Susan G. Komen for the Cure. ... Mets C Ramon Castro did not start after leaving Saturday with a tight right quad. Santos started in his place. ... Pirates SS Jack Wilson (sprained finger) skipped his rehab start with Triple-A Indianapolis and flew back to Pittsburgh. He'll work out at PNC Park on Monday and is scheduled to be activated before the Pirates' game against St. Louis on Tuesday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

BALTIMORE -- After Aubrey Huff had his fun at the expense of Joba Chamberlain, the New York Yankees got in the last word against the Baltimore Orioles.	Johnny Damon hit a three-run homer in the seventh inning, the biggest blow in a long-ball attack that carried New York to a 5-3 victory Sunday.	Mark Teixeira and Robinson Cano also connected for the Yankees, who received a gritty pitching performance from Chamberlain (2-1) to capture the decisive matchup of the three-game series.	Huff homered off Chamberlain in the first inning to stake Baltimore to a 3-1 lead. Huff emphatically pumped his fist after rounding first base, then did it again with even more gusto after he crossed the plate. It was a rare show of emotion by the 32-year-old, who is usually far more reserved after hitting a home run -- especially in the first inning.	Chamberlain has angered opponents for his enthusiastic fist pumps on the mound, and Huff responded with his own version of the celebration.	"He does that stuff all the time as a pitcher, so I was just having a little fun with him out there," Huff said. "That's just part of the game. You get excited in situations like that. I wasn't showing anybody up. I was just having a good time."	Huff insisted that his fist pumps were not to be interpreted as a figurative slap in the face to Chamberlain.	"It's OK if pitchers do it. If batters do it, it's kind of stupid. Everybody kind of frowns on it. So I wanted to have fun with it," Huff said. "I'm kind of a jokester guy; I enjoy messing around and stuff like that. It wasn't a shot at him. He can do what he wants out there."	Said Chamberlain: "I didn't even notice. It's a home run. No reason to be upset; he did what he's supposed to do. I made a bad pitch and he went and got a home run."	Held to one run through six innings by Orioles rookie Koji Uehara, New York rallied in the seventh against the struggling Baltimore bullpen. After Cano hit a solo shot off Jamie Walker, Francisco Cervelli and Derek Jeter got infield hits against Jim Johnson (2-1) before Damon drove a 3-2 pitch into the right-field seats.	"Who would have thought it would come down to a couple of infield hits at the end, the way the ball has been flying around here," Orioles manager Dave Trembley said.	It was Damon's ninth homer, the sixth in 10 games, and marked the seventh straight game in which he got at least one extra-base hit. He struck out twice and hit into a double play against Uehara.	"He had me guessing and chasing all day long," Damon said of Uehara. "I wasn't too happy with that."	Uehara gave up six hits, walked none and struck out five. The Japanese rookie has a 1.64 ERA in two starts against the Yankees this season, but only one win to show for it.	Much of the blame lies on the bullpen.
