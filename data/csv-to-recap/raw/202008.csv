DETROIT --  JaCoby Jones hit an inside-the-park home run in the seventh inning and the Detroit Tigers breezed to their fourth straight victory, 5-1 over the Chicago White Sox on Monday night.	Niko Goodrum homered and had four hits for the Tigers, who handed Chicago its fifth loss in six games. Detroit is 4-0 since returning from a four-day layoff created by a postponed series against St. Louis, which had a coronavirus outbreak.	"Everyone's getting better, at least on one thing each day," Goodrum said. "I used those four days to just reflect on what I was doing well and what I can improve on."	It wasn't all good news for Detroit, though. First baseman C.J. Cron exited with a left knee injury in the fourth.	White Sox slugger Jose Abreu came up limping after grounding out in the eighth and left the game as well.	"He ended up hitting the bag a little stiffly," manager Rick Renteria said. "So it ended up running a stinging sensation from his ankle all the way through his hip. But I think it's given way. I think he should be fine, but we'll know more tomorrow."	The Tigers improved to 9-5 on the year after losing 114 games in 2019.	Detroit was up 3-1 in the seventh when center fielder Adam Engel went for a lunging catch on a sinking liner by Jones. Engel missed, and it's a long way out to the wall in center field at Comerica Park. Jones circled the bases and scored standing up for a two-run homer, his fifth of the season.	Michael Fulmer pitched three scoreless innings for Detroit, and Daniel Norris (1-1) worked two.	Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire was asked if those two might work in tandem on a consistent basis, but he wouldn't commit to it.	"We had a lot going on today. We're still trying to get everything straightened out," Gardenhire said. "We said that was going to be the tandem and we like it. We'll just see if we stay with it."	Gregory Soto went 1 1/3 hitless innings in relief for the Tigers.	Chicago starter Dallas Keuchel (2-2) allowed three runs and six hits in six innings.	Detroit's Jeimer Candelario slapped a double down the right-field line to bring home the first run in the fourth. Goodrum hit a solo shot in the sixth, and Victor Reyes added a run-scoring single in the seventh.	Chicago's only run came in the seventh on an RBI groundout by Engel.	Cron was struck by Danny Mendick's hard-hit grounder in the fourth and stayed down for a while. He eventually walked off with some assistance. Norris made an acrobatic play, hustling over to retrieve the ball and retiring Mendick with a diving tag while Cron lay on the ground in pain.	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox: SS Leury Garcia appeared to be having his left hand checked after sliding into first in the seventh, but he remained in the game.	Tigers: Detroit put RHP Buck Farmer on the 10-day injured list with a left groin strain. The Tigers recalled RHP Beau Burrows. The initial timetable on Farmer is 10-14 days.	UP NEXT	LHP Tyler Alexander (1-0) starts for Detroit on Tuesday night against LHP Gio Gonzalez (0-1). Alexander makes his first start of the season. He struck out the first nine hitters he faced in an Aug. 2 relief appearance against Cincinnati.	---	Follow Noah Trister at https://twitter.com/noahtrister	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

NEW YORK --  Asdrubal Cabrera went 4 for 4 with two homers, two doubles and five RBI, tormenting his former team again as the Washington Nationals routed the New York Mets 16-4 on Monday night.	Juan Soto and Trea Turner homered in the third inning for the Nationals, who scored just 11 runs in their previous five games -- including Sunday's game against the Baltimore Orioles, which was suspended in the sixth with Washington trailing 5-2.	Manager Dave Martinez said he sensed Monday afternoon that getting away from Nationals Park -- where Washington played its first 11 games, including two as the "visiting" team against the Toronto Blue Jays from July 29-30 -- was the spark the Nationals needed.	"Sometimes it's good to try and get away and do something different," Martinez said. "I felt that tonight with these guys. We showed up. They took batting practice. They were rip-raring to go.	"You saw how they played. Let's keep it going."	Keeping it going against his old team doesn't seem to be a problem for Cabrera, who played 374 games for the Mets from 2016-18.	Making his fifth career start at first base, Cabrera homered for the Nationals' first run, doubled leading off the fourth, laced a two-run double in the fifth and hit a two-run homer in the seventh. He became the first player to go 4 for 4 with four extra-base hits against a former team since Johnny Cooney of the Brooklyn Dodgers did it versus the Boston Bees in 1937, according to STATS.	Cabrera is batting .452 (14 for 31) with three homers and 11 RBI in eight games against the Mets since Washington signed him on Aug. 6, 2019.	"It's not easy to come here and play with no fans," Cabrera said. "But it's part of the business right now."	Soto's RBI double produced the first run of a seven-run fifth, which was the Nationals' biggest inning since a nine-run second against Cleveland last Sept. 28. Howie Kendrick, Yan Gomes and Turner all had RBI singles, and Josh Harrison delivered a sacrifice fly.	Gomes drew a bases-loaded walk and Michael A. Taylor had an RBI single in the sixth for the Nationals, who scored their most runs since a 16-8 win over Milwaukee last Aug. 18. Washington's 17 hits were its most since a 17-hit outburst against Atlanta last Sept. 8.	Soto launched a drive that landed beyond the Mets' home run apple in center field and was projected at a career-long 463 feet. He also doubled and singled before exiting in the sixth.	"I followed the ball all the way -- it was way far," Soto said. "Most of the time, I don't see where they're landing. You don't even feel it. You just see the ball jump off the bat."	Patrick Corbin (2-0) cruised to the win and permitted two runs (one earned) over six innings.	Steven Matz (0-3) was hammered for eight runs over 4 1/3 innings, the most earned runs he's allowed in a start. He gave up five runs over three innings against the Nationals in his previous outing last Tuesday.	"I've got to get with (pitching coach Jeremy) Hefner and make some adjustments here, because two games like this is unacceptable," Matz said.	Mets reserve infielder Luis Guillorme made his major league pitching debut and tossed a perfect ninth inning.	Jeff McNeil had three hits for the Mets, and Brandon Nimmo homered in the ninth. J.D. Davis' hitting streak was snapped at a career-high 13 games.	UGLY PERFORMANCE	The Mets gave up their most runs since a 25-4 loss at Washington on July 31, 2018. It matched a 16-1 loss to Philadelphia in September 2012 for the most runs they've allowed at Citi Field, which opened in 2009.	HAPPY BIRTHDAY, WILSON	Mets catcher Wilson Ramos turned 33. He went 1 for 2 with a double.	DO IT YOURSELF DAVE	Martinez, who had a heart procedure last season and admitted he was scared after the coronavirus outbreak among the Miami Marlins in late July, was prepared for the Nationals' first road trip and the train ride to New York City.	"I have my own little Lysol bottle. I have my bottle of wipes. I cleaned my table down," said Martinez, who added he cleaned the tables for coaches Tim Bogar and Kevin Long as well. "I had gloves on, had my mask on the whole time."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: RHP Marcus Stroman opted out of the remainder of the season. Stroman hadn't pitched this year due to a torn left calf sustained during summer workouts. The impending free agent was scheduled to pitch in a third and potentially final simulated game Tuesday.	Nationals: RHP Max Scherzer (right hamstring) felt good while throwing a bullpen Sunday and will start Tuesday night. Scherzer exited his outing against the Mets last Wednesday after one inning due to the hamstring problem, which first cropped up against the Blue Jays on July 29. . RHP Will Harris (groin) is traveling with the team and scheduled to throw to hitters Tuesday. He was placed on the injured list July 31, retroactive to July 29.	UP NEXT	Nationals: Scherzer (0-1, 3.29 ERA) tied his career low by lasting just the one inning last week.	Mets: RHP Rick Porcello (1-1, 6.92 ERA) will look to build on his best outing with New York when he opposes the Nationals for a second straight time. Porcello allowed one run over seven innings and earned the win last Wednesday.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

MILWAUKEE --  Eddie Rosario and the Minnesota Twins needed one big hack to get back in the swing of things.	Rosario hit a grand slam in the third inning, Randy Dobnak turned in another solid outing and the Twins beat the Milwaukee Brewers 4-2 on Monday night to snap a four-game skid.	That slide matched the Twins' longest losing streak from last season during their run to an AL Central title. Minnesota's 2019 four-game skid covered the same dates (Aug. 6-9) as this year's slump.	"We were all waiting for that clutch hit," Rosario said. "Luckily I was able to connect tonight."	Rosario's shot erased an early 1-0 deficit and gave Dobnak and the Twins bullpen all the runs they needed.	Dobnak (3-1) allowed one run over five innings and retired his last eight batters to continue his hot start to the season. The right-hander has given up just two runs over 20 innings in his first four starts.	"I trust my stuff," Dobnak said. "Every time I go out there, I have 100% confidence in my stuff, to pitch to the best of my ability and give my team a chance to win."	Keston Hiura homered and Orlando Arcia hit an RBI double for the Brewers.	This game matched two starters who entered the night with ERAs below 1.00. Milwaukee's Adrian Houser came in having yielded just one run over 12 innings.	The Brewers staked Houser to a 1-0 lead in the second as Orlando Arcia hit a two-out drive that eluded a leaping Rosario and went off the left-field wall for an RBI double. Arcia's big hit snapped Dobnak's string of 13 2/3 consecutive scoreless innings.	Minnesota countered quickly.	Alex Avila hit a leadoff single in the third and Max Kepler followed with an infield hit. After Jorge Polanco grounded into a fielder's choice, Nelson Cruz was hit by a pitch.	That loaded the bases for Rosario, who blasted a pitch over the wall in right center for his fourth career grand slam.	"That's vintage Rosey," Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. "That's the kind of stuff he does. I think he really enjoys those situations. He doesn't get timid when things start happening on the field, when there are people on base, when there's big moments. It was very big for our group. It was a big pick-me-up and kind of elevated us to a good place energy-wise."	Rosario's slam came on a first-pitch changeup.	"I thought it was an all right pitch in that situation," Houser said. "I was trying to get a roll-over ground ball there. I don't think I executed it exactly like I wanted to. Looking back on it, maybe I could have gone with a sinker, a stronger pitch. I still like the changeup there. I just didn't execute it like I wanted to."	Milwaukee star Christian Yelich singled and was left stranded at third in the bottom of the third inning, and the Brewers didn't put another runner on base until Avisail Garcia hit a two-out single in the sixth.	The Brewers cut Minnesota's lead to 4-2 when Hiura led off the eighth by homering to left center on an 0-2 pitch from Sergio Romo. The Brewers brought the tying run to the plate when Manny Pina hit a two-out double in the ninth, but Taylor Rogers struck out Mark Mathias to earn his fourth save.	Houser (1-1) pitched five innings and gave up only those four runs on Rosario's grand slam. Freddy Peralta struck out eight and allowed only one hit and one walk in four innings of shutout relief.	TRAINERS' ROOM	BREWERS: Milwaukee activated INF Luis Urias from the injured list and started him at second base. Urias also should get plenty of opportunities at shortstop. It caps a long road back for Urias, who had surgery on his left wrist in January and then tested positive for the coronavirus at the start of summer camp. ... 1B/OF Logan Morrison was designated for assignment. Morrison was hitting .120 (3 of 25) with one homer and two RBI.	Twins: 3B Josh Donaldson has taken ground balls and is swinging the bat and running, but manager Rocco Baldelli cautioned that the team would remain cautious with him. Donaldson is on the injured list with a strained right calf. "They're not injuries you really want to mess with," Baldelli said. "You can't really go out there and play with a calf that's kind of coming back. It's something that is going to have to be 100%."	UP NEXT	The Twins and Brewers continue their three-game series Tuesday in Milwaukee. Josh Lindblom (1-0, 4.15) will pitch for Milwaukee. Minnesota will start Tyler Clippard (0-0, 1.17).	---	Follow Steve Megargee on Twitter: http://twitter.com/stevemegargee	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

DENVER --  Kole Calhoun homered and had a two-run double to lead Arizona's 18-hit outburst, and the Diamondbacks beat the Colorado Rockies 12-8 on Monday night.	David Peralta and Ketel Marte got four hits each for Arizona, which finished with 13 singles.	Alex Young (1-0) worked two innings of relief for the win. Archie Bradley entered in the ninth with the bases loaded and allowed just one run, earning his fourth save.	The teams combined for 15 runs and 21 hits through five innings at Coors Field, chasing both starters before the end of the fourth.	"This is a great place to hit. I think that's not a secret. It feels like it's going to be a slugfest no matter what," said Calhoun, who hit his home run to the opposite field. "It's nice to see everybody keep swinging it and keep putting up crooked numbers."	Rockies outfielder Charlie Blackmon continued his torrid start with four singles to extend his hitting streak to 14 games. He has 10 multi-hit games in that stretch, including the last five to raise his batting average to .484, tops in the majors.	"It's so early into this thing, you can't weigh things unless you're Charlie Blackmon, who's got 30 hits when some guys don't have 30 at-bats," Calhoun said.	Blackmon has 12 hits in his last 15 at-bats.	"He's just unbelievable. He's probably the best hitter I've ever played with," said teammate Nolan Arenado, who also had four hits. "These guys are tough lefties and for Charlie to have the at-bats that he has, it's fun to watch. The zone you dream of is what he's in right now. I'm trying to learn something from him."	Trevor Story and Chris Owings homered for Colorado.	Calhoun set the tone with a leadoff homer against Jon Gray (0-2) and added a two-run double in a three-run seventh that gave Arizona a four-run lead. The Diamondbacks had three innings in which they scored three runs, and they never trailed.	Colorado stayed close by answering every rally until the seventh. The Rockies scored a run in the first, two in the third and three in the fourth to chase starter Robbie Ray, who lasted just 3 2/3 innings.	"You can't take anything for granted with this ballpark," Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said. "With the way the ball jets out of here, you've got to be extremely careful how you manage the lineup and I thought our bullpen did a tremendous job."	Owings' second home run of the season -- against his former team -- cut the lead to 8-7 in the fifth. Marte's single in the ninth gave Arizona a five-run cushion.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: Placed LHP Madison Bumgarner on the 10-day injured list with a mid-back strain. Bumgarner left Sunday's game at San Diego after two innings due to back spasms.	Rockies: RHP Wade Davis (right shoulder strain) still hasn't started throwing, manager Bud Black said. Davis has been on the 10-day IL since Aug. 1. Black said Davis and RHP Chi Chi Gonzalez (right biceps tendinitis) are continuing to get treatment.	LIKE OLD TIMES	Colorado's starting staff was a strength when the team went to the postseason in 2018. Last year things went sideways, especially for lefty Kyle Freeland, who endured a 3-11 campaign after finishing fourth in NL Cy Young Award voting the year before.	The starters are back to being a strength for the Rockies, but it's not a surprise to Black.	"Last year was tough for starters and relievers," Black said. "Their personal expectation was they would bounce back, and that was my expectation. I've seen them pitch well and make adjustments."	UP NEXT	The Diamondbacks send RHP Zac Gallen (0-0, 2.81 ERA) to the mound against Freeland (2-0, 2.41) in the middle game of the series Tuesday night.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

HOUSTON --  After a terrible road trip, Lance McCullers Jr. gave the Houston Astros just what they needed to get back on track Monday night.	McCullers pitched no-hit ball into the seventh inning, Michael Brantley and Carlos Correa drove in two runs each and the Astros snapped a five-game skid with a 6-4 win over the San Francisco Giants.	McCullers (2-1) bounced back from one of the worst performances of his career with a gem where he allowed one hit and struck out five in seven scoreless innings.	"He was masterful tonight," manager Dusty Baker said. "He was more aggressive with his fastball, which increased their swinging for the breaking ball."	The 26-year-old tied a career high by allowing eight runs in just 3 2/3 innings of a 14-7 loss at Arizona his last time out.	"It was just up to me not to blow it again," McCullers said. "We needed a win tonight. We needed to start the homestand on a big, positive note and we did that."	His only hit allowed Monday came when Donovan Solano extended his MLB-best hitting streak to 15 games with a grounder down the third base line that rolled just out of reach of Alex Bregman for a double with one out in the seventh.	"Wrong pitch," McCullers said. "That was on me shaking and not throwing the correct pitch in that situation."	The Astros got back in the win column a day after an ugly 7-2 loss to the Athletics that was marred by a benches-clearing fight that could lead to the suspension of hitting coach Alex Cintron. Cintron was yelling at Oakland's Ramon Laureano before the A's outfielder charged Houston's dugout, leading to the team's second such incident this season after the Astros also got into with the Dodgers.	San Francisco rookie starter Logan Webb (1-1) allowed four hits and five runs -- only two earned because of two errors -- in 3 1/3 innings.	"It's hard not to look at the line and feel discouraged," Giants manager Gabe Kapler said. "But at the same time, I think he can be proud of going through that lineup and not really giving up on much hard contact. I think we have better in us behind him that's for that's for sure."	The Giants got things going on offense after McCullers left the game. Austin Slater had a solo shot off Josh James that made it 6-1 in the eighth inning.	Solano chased James on an RBI double with no outs in the ninth. Ryan Pressly retired the next two batters before the Giants cut it to 6-3 on a run-scoring single by Brandon Crawford. Slater hit an RBI single before Pressly retired pinch-hitter Evan Longoria to get his first save.	Bregman was hit in the shoulder  by Solano's throw home while trying to score on Yuli Gurriel's grounder in the third. The ball bounced off Bregman, glanced off catcher Chadwick Tromp's mask and rolled away, allowing Bregman to score.	McCullers, who missed last season after Tommy John surgery, retired his first six batters before plunking Slater on the leg to start the third inning. He helped himself out with a nifty defensive play to end that inning when he ran to cover first base on a grounder hit by Mike Yastrzemski, made an off-balance catch and tagged Yastrzemski before falling to the dirt.	Martin Maldonado snapped a 0-for-13 slump when he connected off Conner Menez for a solo homer to the seats in right field to start Houston's sixth and make it 6-0.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: OF George Springer missed his fourth straight game Monday because of a strained right wrist. He visited a hand specialist on Monday in Houston and there was no additional damage. He remains day to day.	SIZZLING SOLANO	Solano's two hits Monday improved his average to .458, which ranks second in the majors behind Colorado's Charlie Blackmon (.484).	His 15-game hitting streak is a career best, and he's the first Giant to have a hitting streak of 15 games or more since Angel Pagan had a 19-game hitting streak in 2016.	UP NEXT	Houston rookie Brandon Bielak (2-0, 0.87 ERA) will make his second career start when the series continues Tuesday night. Bielak, who made two relief appearances this season, allowed two hits in five scoreless innings in his first start on Thursday against Arizona but did not factor in the decision in Houston's 5-4 loss. Left-hander Tyler Anderson (0-1, 2.19) will start for San Francisco.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Kyle Seager hit a grand slam, Kyle Lewis and Dylan Moore also homered and the Seattle Mariners won 10-2 Monday night in their first game at the new Texas ballpark, snapping the Rangers' three-game winning streak.	Lewis put the Mariners up 4-2 with his fourth homer, a three-run shot to center field in the fifth off Kyle Gibson (0-2). Seager cleared the bases an inning later with a high-arching drive  that dropped near the first row of seats a few feet beyond the right-field wall for his fifth career slam.	Moore already had a pair of RBI singles before his solo homer to center in the seventh for Seattle, which had lost seven of nine.	"If you snake it just right down the line, you can get it," Seager said about his homer. "But I don't think there was a park that was going to hold either Lewis or Dylan. They hammered the ball."	With the retractable roof opened at Globe Life Field during a game for the first time, the Mariners' three homers were only one fewer than opponents had hit overall in the first eight games there. Everybody in their lineup had a hit and the 10 runs were the most by any team -- only twice before had there been a combined 10 runs in a game. Texas has five homers at home.	"With the roof open, it was a little warmer, but it wasn't bad at all," Mariners manager Scott Servais said. "It was a fun game. A lot of guys contributing, everybody feels good, you start feeling some momentum. We needed a game like this. We hadn't had one this year."	Rangers manager Chris Woodward didn't think the park played any differently with the roof opened, and being 95 degrees outside at first pitch.	"Maybe it was a little bit hotter, but couldn't really feel it," Woodward said. "Maybe the players were sweating more, but the field was fine. I didn't like the outcome."	Justin Dunn (1-1) limited Texas to two runs over six innings for his first big league victory, a day after Justus Sheffield, another 24-year-old Mariners starter, won for the first time. Dunn had gone only seven innings combined his first two starts this season after pitching in four games at the end of last year in his MLB debut.	Gibson allowed four runs and nine hits in 4 1/3 innings. He struck out two and walked one.	Willie Calhoun drove in both runs for Texas, which was coming off a three-game weekend sweep at home over the Los Angeles Angels.	Calhoun had an RBI triple in the first and a sacrifice fly in the third that made it 2-1. The triple ricocheted hard off the wall in the right-field corner back toward the infield, and might have been an inside-the-park homer if he hadn't initially jogged out of the batter's box while watching the ball.	SHORT HOPS	Lewis has a 13-game hitting streak in road games, dating to last season, with multiple hits in the last six. ... Seager has 103 RBI in 154 career games against the Rangers, one of only three Mariners and 16 players overall with 100 RBI vs. Texas. He has 29 homers and 101 runs. ... Rangers 3B Isiah Kiner-Falefa made two diving, backhand plays for outs in the fourth, taking hits away from Austin Nola and Evan White.	ROSTER MOVES	Seattle claimed RHP Brady Lail off waivers from the Chicago White Sox and designated INF Patrick Wisdom for assignment. ... Texas recalled LHP Taylor Hearn from the alternate training site, and sent down rookie OF Adolis Garcia. Free agent INF Derek Dietrich signed a minor league deal.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: RHP Carl Edwards Jr. (right forearm strain) was put on the 10-day injured list. He last worked Wednesday, pitching a second day in a row to get his first save since 2016 as a rookie with the Chicago Cubs.	Texas: RHP Nick Goody, out the last three games with back stiffness, came on to get the final out in the ninth after the Mariners had loaded the bases.	UP NEXT	In a matchup of left-handers, Seattle's Marco Gonzalez (2-1, 3.06 ERA) goes for his third victory in a row. Mike Minor (0-3, 6.89), a first-time All-Star for Texas last season, has the most losses in the AL.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Mike Trout is beginning to believe there might be something to the notion of having added power after the birth of a child.	The reigning AL MVP has certainly been on a tear since son Beckham was born. Trout homered twice Monday night, including a tiebreaking shot in the eighth inning, as the Los Angeles Angels rallied from an early five-run deficit for a 10-9 victory that snapped the Oakland Athletics' nine-game winning streak.	"People ask me about this Dad power. I guess it is a thing," Trout said. "There's nothing like being a Dad."	With three hits in the series opener, Trout is 11 for 30 with six home runs and 11 RBI in the past seven games. He rejoined the team in Seattle on Aug. 4 after his wife, Jessica, gave birth to Beckham on July 30.	"I am a little more relaxed. Leading up to it I was extremely worried about the coronavirus," Trout said. "I didn't want to have it and come home. But we have been keeping it safe in the Trouthold and everyone in the organization has been doing a good job."	Anthony Rendon and Shohei Ohtani also homered for the Angels.	Trout's solo drive off Yusmeiro Petit (1-1) in the eighth helped Los Angeles stop a three-game skid. It was the 20th multi-homer game of Trout's career, which tied Tim Salmon and Vladimir Guerrero for the franchise record.	"We had a rough weekend. We weren't doing our jobs when we had our chances," Trout said. "But this is a new homestand and we got a huge win against an Oakland team that was coming in hot."	Los Angeles trailed 9-4 in the fourth before Trout began the rally with a two-run drive into the Angels' bullpen in left field. Ohtani had an RBI double in the inning to bring them to 9-7 and then tied it with a two-run homer to center in the sixth.	It was Ohtani's 44th career home run, which tied Tadahito Iguchi for fourth in the majors by a Japanese-born player.	The Angels' bullpen, which has struggled this season, allowed only two hits over the final five innings.	Noe Ramirez, Keynan Middleton, Felix Pena (1-0) and Ty Buttrey held Oakland scoreless. Buttrey earned his second save.	"They struggled early in the season, but hopefully the issue has resolved itself," manager Joe Maddon said. "Normally it takes a month to get a bullpen in order and we are trying to do it more quickly."	Matt Chapman homered twice and tied a career high with six RBI for AL West-leading Oakland.	After the Angels got three runs in the first, Chapman put Oakland on the board as he lined Julio Teheran's fastball over the wall in left-center leading off the second. Chapman gave Oakland a 5-3 lead an inning later with a two-run drive to center for the fifth multi-homer game of his career.	Chapman's bases-loaded triple in the fourth extended the Athletics' lead to 8-4. But after Chapman scored when Mark Canha's shallow fly to left popped out of Justin Upton's glove, the A's managed only two hits over the final five innings.	"We had a couple of bad pitches, plus pretty good hitting lineup on their part, too," Oakland manager Bob Melvin said. "Our guys have been pretty good this season and it was just a tough night. Tonight was an offensive night and hitters got their due. For a bullpen that's been as good as we have been, we just gave up some runs tonight."	FOR STARTERS	Teheran retired the side in the first but ran into problems after that. The right-hander went only two-plus innings and allowed five runs on five hits.	Oakland's Sean Manaea also ran into early problems. The left-hander went 2 2/3 innings and was charged with four runs on seven hits.	RENDON'S MILESTONE	Rendon had two hits to reach 1,000 for his career. The Angels' third baseman -- who signed a seven-year, $245 million contract during the offseason -- reached the milestone in the sixth inning with a line-drive single to center.	Rendon came into the game in an 0-for-21 slide but quickly snapped that with a two-run drive to left to extend Los Angeles' lead to 3-0 in the first.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: SS Andrelton Simmons (ankle) took batting practice and did some running before the game. Maddon said Simmons is getting closer to returning but didn't have a definitive timetable. ... LHP Jose Suarez was taken off the injured list due to an undisclosed injury and optioned to the alternate training site.	UP NEXT	Oakland RHP Mike Fiers (1-0, 5.63 ERA) has won his past two starts at Angel Stadium. He will be opposed by right-hander Dylan Bundy (2-1, 2.08), who threw the Angels' first complete game since 2018 last Wednesday at Seattle.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

LOS ANGELES --  The young Padres dropped two of three at home against the Dodgers recently. San Diego arrived in Los Angeles and immediately got the seven-time NL West champions' attention by stealing the series opener.	Eric Hosmer singled in the go-ahead run with two outs in the sixth inning, and the Padres won 2-1 on Monday night after their bullpen fired eight scoreless innings, allowing two hits and striking out six.	Cal Quantrill (2-0) got the victory with three innings of relief. He allowed two hits and struck out three. Drew Pomeranz retired the side in the ninth for his third save.	"We talked about it to begin the year, we're going to need a big group of guys," Padres manager Jayce Tingler said. "So it's just nice to see them get their opportunity and contribute. They all stepped up against a very tough lineup and made pitches."	Joc Pederson bobbled the ball on Hosmer's hit to left and couldn't attempt a throw as Trent Grisham scored from second after Dustin May (1-1) walked him, giving the Padres a 2-1 lead.	Austin Hedges homered with two outs in the fifth to tie it at 1. It was Hedges' third hit and first homer of the season and only the second home run given up by May.	Emilio Pagan retired Mookie Betts, Cody Bellinger and Justin Turner in order in the eighth, and the Dodgers managed just four hits. Betts, Bellinger and Turner were 1 for 4 with a strikeout each.	"Those guys pitched just great," Tingler said. "And for two of the guys to do it without game reps in seven to eight days, hats off."	Los Angeles was 1 for 8 with runners in scoring position and the team's streak of homering in 11 straight games ended.	The Dodgers had runners on first and third with two outs in the seventh. Chris Taylor walked, took second on a groundout and went to third on a pickoff error by catcher Hedges. Pederson's comebacker off Craig Stammen ricocheted into the glove of shortstop Fernando Tatis Jr., who stepped on second to end the inning.	Los Angeles loaded the bases in the fourth, but Edwin Rios lined into a double play to first with Taylor getting doubled off the bag to end the threat.	"Those are situations you got to put up a crooked number," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. "I like the way we're taking at-bats and getting on base, but we still got to get that run."	The Dodgers led 1-0 on Bellinger's RBI single on a two-strike swing in the first.	May gave up two runs and five hits in six innings. He struck out two and walked two.	"They hit the mistakes that I threw," he said. "I had faced these guys five, six days ago, so we had to mix in more offspeed pitches. They have a feel for you, you have a feel for them. I assume they had a game plan and it was get ahead early."	May has gone from replacing injured Clayton Kershaw as the opening day starter to making a case to stay in the rotation permanently with his performance over three starts.	"He's doing nothing but showing his value to our ballclub," Roberts said, while noting that May is "still establishing himself as a major league pitcher."	San Diego's Luis Perdomo made his first start since June 9, 2019, in place of Garrett Richards. The right-hander allowed one run and two hits in one inning, and walked one.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: RHP Joe Kelly went on the 10-day injured list with right shoulder inflammation retroactive to Sunday. ... LHP Alex Wood (shoulder inflammation) threw a 30-pitch bullpen session Monday. He'll toss a simulated game on Thursday. ... SS Corey Seager continues to receive treatment and is moving around better since leaving a game last week with lower back discomfort. The team has not decided if he'll go on the IL.	KELLY'S HEARING	Less than two weeks ago, Kelly was suspended by MLB for eight games for throwing two pitches near the heads of Houston hitters. Roberts said the appeal hearing was Monday and he expects a ruling in the next few days. Any suspension would not begin until Kelly comes off the IL.	BIG SWING	Tatis swung so hard he fell down and his bat smacked him in the rear in the third inning. He ended up striking out swinging. He later extended his hitting streak to eight games with a single in the eighth. He's batting .375 with six homers and nine RBI during the streak.	UP NEXT	Padres: RHP Richards (0-1, 4.60 ERA) had his scheduled start pushed back to Tuesday to give him extra rest.	Dodgers: RHP Ross Stripling (3-0, 4.00) beat the Padres in San Diego last week. He struck out seven in 5 2/3 innings.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.

BUFFALO, N.Y. --  Bo Bichette, Travis Shaw and the wandering Toronto Blue Jays felt just fine in their new nest.	In the first major league game in Buffalo since 1915, Shaw hit an RBI single with the bases loaded in the 10th inning as the Blue Jays settled into refitted Sahlen Field with a 5-4 win over the Miami Marlins on Tuesday night.	"We're still staying in a hotel, but it almost felt like the first game of the year. To go out and say, `All right, this is our spot,' I think we did well," said Bichette, who hit a three-run homer.	Barred from playing in Toronto by the Canadian government over concerns about the coronavirus, the Blue Jays spent nearly three weeks on the road before moving into the ballpark of their Triple-A affiliate as their temporary home this year.	And in the city famed for wings and beef on weck sandwiches, Toronto made it a tasty home opener. The downtown park, a couple blocks from Lake Erie and seating nearly 17,000, was empty because of the virus outbreak.	"It's definitely a little different," Marlins manager Don Mattingly said.	Francisco Cervelli's three-run homer with two outs in the Miami ninth made it 4-all.	Logan Forsythe then nearly put the Marlins ahead with a long drive in the 10th that originally was ruled a two-run homer, then reversed to a foul ball on review -- the replay cameras were among the upgrades made at the park to get it up to big league standards.	There had not been a major league game in Buffalo since Sept. 8, 1915, when the Blues swept a doubleheader from the Baltimore Terrapins at Federal League Park. Those teams were part of the short-lived Federal League.	Baseball in Buffalo did get major play in the 1984 film "The Natural" starring Robert Redford. Playing Roy Hobbs for the New York Knights in the movie, the game action scenes took place in old War Memorial Stadium, the place that hosted football's Bills and minor league ball.	Shaw's hit might not have had the same drama as Hobbs' film-closing homer, but it produced the same result -- a win.	"We've lost a couple of games late, so it was nice to come back," Shaw said. "My job was just to try to get the ball to the outfield, and thankfully with two strikes, I was able to do that."	Shaw's hit with one out came off Stephen Tarpley (2-1).	Bichette, one of many Blue Jays who played in Buffalo in the minors, homered in the sixth to give Toronto a 3-1 lead. Cavan Biggio added an RBI single in the seventh. A.J. Cole (1-0) got the win.	Sahlen Field, opened in 1988, was the first in a movement of "retro" ballparks personified a year later by Baltimore's Camden Yards. In the early 1990s, the stadium was a key piece of Buffalo's push for a big league expansion team, but franchises were instead awarded to Miami and Denver.	Built for the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons, an affiliate of the Blue Jays since 2013, the park is aesthetically the opposite of Toronto `s futuristic Rogers Centre, the first retractable-roof stadium opened in 1989.	Despite the differences between the two facilities, the Buffalo ballpark in the last two weeks was revamped to capture elements found less than 100 miles away in Toronto.	Rogers Centre's "in the action" seats behind home plate have been replicated and advertisements on the outfield walls are the same as found in Toronto. Those walls, which have been green for 32 years, are now blue, a color which now dominates much of the stadium, along with the omnipresent presence of the Blue Jays logo.	One aspect went unchanged: the ballpark dimensions. It's still 325 feet distance to the corners (though now designated with a maple leaf instead of a bison), 371 to left-center, 367 to right-center, and 404 to straightaway center field.	Extensive renovations included a new infield, the home clubhouse being placed in the area where batting cages once existed, the visiting clubhouse being housed in a large temporary tent behind right-center field, and the Blue Jays' weight room and practice batting cages taking up space in what is normally a public concourse. The work enabled the Blue Jays to occupy their familiar third base dugout, as in Toronto.	"Nobody was complaining about anything," manager Charlie Montoyo said. "The field was playable. Everything was fine."	Toronto starter Hyun Jin Ryu allowed two hits in six innings and struck out seven.	Brian Anderson also homered for Miami. Starter Elieser Hernandez struck out five over 5 1/3 innings.	Miami, too, has been no stranger to the road, spending the last three weeks away from home, including a quarantine spell in Philadelphia while combating a spate of coronavirus diagnoses.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Miami still has 19 players on the injured list, but has gone three straight days without a transaction. Toronto has three players on the IL: outfielder Derek Fisher, and pitchers Ken Giles and Trent Thornton.	UP NEXT	Marlins: Jordan Yamamoto (0-0, 9.00) will make his second start this season for Miami. He allowed four runs in his first start on Aug. 6 at Baltimore.	Blue Jays: Nate Pearson (0-0, 2.70 ERA) will make his third career start when Toronto wraps up the two-game series against Miami. He has 10 strikeouts in as many innings.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

CINCINNATI --  Joey Votto doubled home the winning run in the 10th inning Tuesday night, and the Cincinnati Reds blew another late lead before rallying for a 6-5 victory over the Kansas City Royals.	The Royals tied it 5-5 in the eighth on Ryan McBroom's pinch-hit, two-run homer off Amir Garrett, but they couldn't keep their four-game winning streak going.	Votto saved the Reds from another rough ending.	"Joey came through as he has so many times in his career," manager David Bell said. "That was a great at-bat for us as a team."	With a designated runner on second base in the 10th, Josh Staumont (0-1) walked Nick Castellanos and Votto doubled off the wall  in center, just over the glove of Brett Phillips.	"I imagine if you ask Brett he'll say that's a ball he'll catch nine times out of 10," Royals manager Mike Matheny said. "The ball was hit pretty good though."	Lucas Sims (1-0) gave up a walk in the 10th with a designated runner on second base but escaped the threat.	Matt Davidson and Jesse Winker hit consecutive homers off left-hander Kris Bubic in his first road start as Cincinnati pulled ahead 5-3, but Cincinnati's leaky bullpen let another lead slip away.	Luis Castillo limited the Royals' resurgent offense to three runs -- one earned -- in six innings. The Royals loaded the bases three times in all but managed only one run out of all those chances.	Bubic failed again to get a win in his third big league start. The 40th overall pick in the 2018 draft jumped from Single-A to the majors.	Kyle Farmer hit a two-run double in the second. Davidson had a two-run shot in the third, and Winker followed with a solo shot, the Reds'  first back-to-back homers of the season. Bubic gave up five runs and seven hits in five innings.	"Honestly I thought I pitched better than what the linescore would look like," Bubic said.	The Royals repeatedly wasted bases-loaded chances and failed to take full advantage of three Reds errors.	"It's just a game that should have been ours," Matheny said.	Kansas City left the bases loaded in the second when Alex Gordon lined out. The Royals managed only one run out of a bases-loaded chance in the third, on Ryan O'Hearn's single.	The Royals loaded the bases again with one out in the seventh, but Farmer -- playing shortstop -- made a diving stop on O'Hearn's grounder up the middle and turned a double play to protect the 5-3 lead that slipped away two innings later.	STREAKING	Salvador Perez extended his hitting streak to nine games. Nicky Lopez and Maikel Franco extended theirs to seven games each.	LOT OF Ks	The Reds fanned 11, giving them 196 through the first 17 games, a major league record. The 2018 Astros held the previous mark of 191.	LOPSIDED HISTORY	The Royals are 11-4 against the Reds since 2009, including 7-4 all-time at Great American Ball Park.	NEW ROYALS	Right-handed pitcher Carlos Hernandez and lefty Asa Lacy were added to the 60-man roster. Hernandez pitched at three levels of the minors last year. Lacy, 21, was the fourth overall selection in this year's first-year player draft from Texas A&M.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals: Outfielder Franchy Cordero had surgery to repair a broken bone in his right wrist. He went on the injured list Sunday. Cordero was acquired from the Padres on July 16 and played in 11 games.	Reds: Reliever Pedro Strop went on the 10-day injured list with a groin injury. Infielder Josh VanMeter was recalled.	UP NEXT	Royals: Brad Keller (1-0) makes his first road start of the season and first career start against the Reds.	Reds: Left-hander Wade Miley is expected to come off the injured list and make his second start. He suffered a groin injury in his Reds debut against the Cubs on July 27.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

NEW YORK --  Aaron Judge's home run Tuesday night left the field about as quickly as he did.	Judge dented an advertisement with a scorching homer before making an unusual early exit, Jordan Montgomery pitched efficiently against a lineup missing its brightest young star and the New York Yankees beat the Atlanta Braves 9-6 Tuesday night.	"I'm surprised he didn't put a hole in the sign," teammate Luke Voit said of Judge's shot.	Atlanta scratched Ronald Acuna Jr. about 90 minutes before first pitch with a sore left wrist, and the 2018 NL Rookie of the Year will be examined in New York on Wednesday. Manager Brian Snitker said he wasn't aware of the injury until batting practice Tuesday.	"It was enough that he could't play, he wasn't available today," Snitker said.	Similar concern bubbled around Judge after he was pulled in the sixth inning Tuesday, but manager Aaron Boone said he just wanted to get the star slugger off his feet.	"I just want to make sure we're being smart with every one," Boone said.	Judge smashed his 113.1 mph homer off a sign above the home bullpen in right-center field, leaving his mark on a shot leading off the fifth. He entered the day tied with San Diego's Fernando Tatis Jr. for the major league lead with eight home runs.	Judge's night came to a bizarre end an inning later, when Boone sent Mike Tauchman in to pinch hit. New York led 8-3 -- hardly a blowout -- and Judge didn't appear to be injured.	Judge briefly remained in the dugout, watching Tauchman hit from the top rail, but he returned to the clubhouse about an inning later and didn't return -- not even for postgame handshakes.	No other Yankees' starter was removed at that stage of the game, and with New York getting two days off this week, there shouldn't be much need to rest Judge. Boone maintained Judge -- a consummate teammate praised for his leadership and support -- skipped the end of the game to get an early jump on his postgame routine.	"Just going in and getting his normal treatment," Boone said.	Voit hit a three-run drive in the first inning off Braves starter Touki Toussaint (0-1), who turned in the second straight abysmal start for a rotation that's reeling without injured ace Mike Soroka, lost for the season with a torn right Achilles tendon. Atlanta starters have a 5.57 ERA.	Toussaint allowed six runs -- five earned -- in four innings a night after left-hander Sean Newcomb allowed eight runs in 1 1/3 innings against Philadelphia. Newcomb was demoted to the alternate site after Monday's game.	Judge's home run came off 22-year-old right-hander Bryse Wilson, who was recalled from Atlanta's alternate site to replace Newcomb. Wilson was under consideration to start Wednesday against the Yankees until Toussaint left the Braves in need of long relief.	"It doesn't matter what the situation is," manager Brian Snitker said of his young pitchers. "You have to weather storms with them."	Montgomery (2-1) cruised through five innings before allowing a three-run homer to Marcell Ozuna in the sixth. He threw 78 pitches over six innings, allowing three runs, four hits and a walk with four strikeouts. Zack Britton pitched a perfect ninth inning for his sixth save.	Mike Ford added a two-run double for New York in the third.	Atlanta clawed back from an 8-0 deficit a night after scoring seven runs in the ninth inning of a 13-8 loss to the Phillies. Johan Camargo and Tyler Flowers each had RBI doubles Tuesday.	LEATHER LACKING	New York's middle infielders had a rough night defensively. In the second inning, neither second baseman DJ LeMahieu or shortstop Gleyber Torres covered second on a potential double-play grounder to third baseman Gio Urshela.	LeMahieu and Torres also appeared to have a miscommunication on a grounder up the middle in the seventh, allowing Atlanta's fourth run to score, and Torres made an error that led to another run in the eighth.	"We obviously didn't play our best game tonight," Boone said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Braves: Atlanta says Acuna is day to day, and at this stage, he's not planning to join best friend and second baseman Ozzie Albies on the injured list. Albies has a sore right wrist.	Yankees: OF/DH Giancarlo Stanton is expected to miss three to four weeks after being diagnosed with a grade 1 left hamstring strain, although manager Aaron Boone said the team was still evaluating the 2017 NL MVP and the timeline could be adjusted. ... RHP Aroldis Chapman (COVID-19) threw about 25 pitches against live hitters at the alternate site. His time frame to rejoin the team remains unclear. ... OF Clint Frazier was promoted from the alternate site, two days after INF Thairo Estrada was sent down. ... Voit was hit in the left hand by a pitch in the fifth inning but remained in the game.	UP NEXT	RHP Masahiro Tanaka (0-0, 1.17) is slated to face the Braves after pitching five shutout innings against Tampa Bay in his previous outing. RHP Huascar Ynoa (0-0, 3.86) will open a bullpen game for Atlanta.	---	Follow Jake Seiner: https://twitter.com/Jake-Seiner	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

PHILADELPHIA --  A wacky game had a wild finish.	Austin Hays led off the 10th inning with a two-run, inside-the-park homer to lift the Baltimore Orioles to a 10-9 win over the Philadelphia Phillies on Tuesday night.	Bryce Harper hit a tying, two-run homer in the eighth and Jean Segura gave the Phillies a 6-5 lead with a solo shot two outs later. But closer Hector Neris couldn't hold it.	After Orioles closer Cole Sulser (1-1) allowed a two-run single to Didi Gregorius with two outs in the ninth to tie it at 8, Hays put Baltimore ahead to stay.	With a runner on second to start the extra inning because of new rules, Hays ripped a sinking liner to center off Deolis Guerra (1-2). Roman Quinn dove headfirst and the ball skipped to the warning track. Quinn fell picking it up and Hays circled the bases.	"I actually didn't think he had a chance to catch it when I first hit it," Hays said. "I thought it was going to be a one-hop line drive to him. And I saw him start to lay out, I thought he was going to catch it. He almost did. ... I saw the ball go by him and it was just off to the races. I was sniffing an inside-the-parker the whole way."	Paul Fry allowed an RBI single to Jay Bruce in the 10th but retired Quinn on a bouncer to shortstop with runners on second and third for the second out. Travis Lakins Sr. entered and got Rhys Hoskins on a grounder to a shifted second baseman, earning his first career save.	"I think that game had a little bit of everything," Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. "I just told (Alex) Cobb he did a great job; seems like about five hours ago that he pitched. It was just a gutsy performance by our club. A real grind-out mentality. Just a great team win. A persevering, gutsy, grind-out team win."	The Orioles went ahead 8-6 in the ninth on an unusual play. After Renato Nunez lined an RBI single to to make it 6-6, Neris nearly escaped a bases-loaded jam when Pedro Severino lifted a 2-0 pitch with two outs toward the first-base side of the mound. Segura charged in from third base, called off first baseman Hoskins late and stumbled crossing over the mound as the ball dropped in and two runs scored.	Hoskins said he deferred to Segura because of "pop-up priority" but also took the blame.	"I need to be louder. I called it early. I don't think there's a miscue if I call it again," he said.	Phillies starter Zack Wheeler cruised into the sixth before running into trouble. He allowed three runs and eight hits in 5 2/3 innings.	Orioles starter Alex Cobb yielded three runs -- two earned -- and three hits in 5 1/3 innings.	"That was a game in a lot of ways we gave away," Phillies manager Joe Girardi said.	ROSTER MOVES	The Phillies selected the contracts of RHP Connor Brogdon and RHP Blake Parker. RHP Nick Pivetta was optioned to Triple-A Lehigh Valley, while RHP Trevor Kelley and OF Nick Williams were designated for assignment.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: LH John Means came off the bereavement list and was headed back to Baltimore. He will go on the injured list until completing health and safety protocols.	Phillies: RHP David Robertson and LHP Ranger Suarez are joining the team in Philadelphia after working out at the team's complex in Clearwater, Florida. They'll throw for pitching coach Bryan Price and then go to the team's alternate training site to continue rehab. Robertson, a former closer, is returning from Tommy John surgery. Suarez tested positive for COVID-19 before the season.	OUCH	Plate umpire Pat Hoberg was hit on his left hand by the barrel of a shattered bat in the second inning. He stayed in the inning after a trainer attended to him for several minutes.	UP NEXT	LH Wade LeBlanc (0-1, 6.91 ERA) makes his fourth start of the season for the Orioles on Wednesday night and RHP Zach Eflin (0-0, 0.00) goes for the Phillies. LeBlanc is 2-2 lifetime against Philadelphia, but hasn't faced the Phillies since throwing two hitless innings in relief for Pittsburgh on July 3, 2017. Eflin won his only career start against Baltimore, giving up two runs in seven innings on July 3, 2018.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

Bill Murray and Michael Jordan are among the cardboard cutouts Cubs players aim to hit during batting practice. (0:55)	CLEVELAND --  Jon Lester and the Cubs didn't let another of 2020's distractions slow them one bit.	Lester looked comfortable on a mound where he helped make history, Jason Heyward hit a three-run homer and Chicago returned from a four-day layoff and rolled to a 7-1 win over the Cleveland Indians, who welcomed back manager Terry Francona after a couple bumpy days.	Lester (2-0) allowed three hits in six innings as the Cubs, whose weekend series at St. Louis was postponed because of a COVID-19 outbreak on the Cardinals, moved to 11-3 for the first time since 2016.	Four years ago, Lester pitched three scoreless innings of relief in a drama-filled Game 7 of the World Series when the Cubs beat the Indians to win their first title since 1908. This start had been delayed by the postponements, but Lester said he was picked up by his teammates, who cheered like Little Leaguers from the dugout.	"It's nice to see these guys show up with energy today," Lester said. "Like I've said before, I think that's what (manager David Ross) Rossie kind of brings to these guys. It's that kind of accountability of, hey, maybe we get beat today, but we're going to have energy. We're going to be in every pitch, we're going to grind. We're going to need to do."	Heyward, who drove in Chicago's first run in the second, connected for his second homer to put the Cubs ahead 6-0 in the sixth. Progressive Field is also filled with pleasant memories for Heyward, who famously called a team meeting late in Game 7 to regroup the Cubs after the Indians rallied.	For the first time this year the Indians gave up more than four runs, ending the second-longest run (18 games) to open a season.	Cleveland played for the first time since it was revealed that pitchers Mike Clevinger and Zach Plesac violated team rules by leaving the team's Chicago hotel over the weekend. Both are being quarantined, although the Indians don't think they were near anyone with COVID-19 when they ventured out.	Clevinger had been scheduled to face the Cubs, but his risky behavior landed him on the restricted list and in the doghouse. Adam Plutko (1-1) started for Clevinger and made it clear after the game that his teammates have some making up to do to win back trust.	"They hurt us bad," he said. "They lied to us. They at here in front of you guys and publicly said things that they didn't follow through on. It's gonna be up to them. It really is. I'll let them sit here and tell you how they're gonna earn their trust back.	"I don't need to put words in their mouths. The term that I continue to hear, and excuse my language, is `grown-ass man.' So those grown-ass men can sit here and tell you guys what happened and tell you guys what they're gonna do to fix it. I don't need to do that for them."	Francona returned after missing eight games to rest and treat a gastrointestinal ailment that has bothered him for nearly a year. He underwent another procedure last week at the Cleveland Clinic and said he's going to do try and finish the season.	"I can't promise this is going to go perfect," he said. "But I'm certainly going to give it the best shot I can."	The Cubs pushed a run across in the second, which began with Kyle Schwarber battling for 11 pitches -- to the delight of Chicago's barking bench -- before Plutko struck him out. But the at-bat may have helped Contreras, who singled, moved up on a walk and scored on Heyward's single.	Chicago tacked on five more in the sixth of reliever Cam Hill on a sacrifice fly by Contreras and Happ's RBI single before Heyward went deep off Phil Maton.	SECOND HOME	Jason Kipnis knew exactly where he was going. Mostly.	Back in Cleveland for the first time as a visitor after nine seasons with the Indians, Kipnis, who signed with the Cubs as a free agent, found himself in hallways and hidden areas he'd never been.	"I'm getting to see a whole different side," he said.	Kipnis loved his time with the Indians and said it's sometimes tough to think about what might have been in '16 -- if not for the Cubs.	"I've already had (Anthony) Rizzo walking me through where `I celebrated here. I celebrated here," Kipnis said. "I'm like, `Thanks, buddy, I get it."	Kipnis was saluted with a video tribute before the game and greeted warmly by both dugouts before his first at-bat. He doubled.	"It was a good moment," Francona said. "He deserved it. He'd been a good Cleveland Indian for a long time."	WALK MAN	Cleveland's Carlos Santana has drawn a walk in nine straight games and leads the league with 24. He moved past Tris Speaker (857) and into second place in team history behind Jim Thome (1,008) in walks.	UP NEXT	Carlos Carrasco (2-1) starts for the Indians, who will have another flashback from in 2016 when they face Kyle Hendricks (2-1). He started Game 7 when the Cubs clinched.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

DETROIT --  Eloy Jimenez hit a three-run homer in the first inning, and the Chicago White Sox snapped Detroit's four-game wining streak with an 8-4 victory over the Tigers on Tuesday night.	Edwin Encarnacion also went deep for the White Sox, who won for only the second time in seven games. Austin Romine hit a two-run shot for Detroit.	Jose Abreu had three hits, including a pair of RBI doubles.	Gio Gonzalez was pulled one out shy of the win. He allowed two runs and six hits in 4 2/3 innings.	"It's always frustrating," Gonzalez said. "You never want to give up the ball in a situation like that."	Matt Foster (2-0) was credited with the win after striking out four in two perfect innings.	Tyler Alexander (1-1) allowed five runs in 3 2/3 innings in his first start of the season. His previous appearance was a memorable one -- he struck out an American League record-tying nine straight hitters during a relief appearance Aug. 2 against Cincinnati.	"His breaking ball wasn't sharp. For the most part he got things up. That's a powerful lineup. Just one of those days," Detroit manager Ron Gardenhire said. "The kid's been throwing great. We've all seen it. It just didn't work out today."	Abreu opened the scoring with a run-scoring double in the first, and Jimenez's home run to right field made it 4-0. Encarnacion hit a solo shot in the fourth.	Romine's homer came in the fifth. Jimenez hit an RBI single in the sixth, and the White Sox added two more runs in the seventh.	Harold Castro hit an RBI single as part of Detroit's two-run ninth.	Gonzalez was taken out with two outs in the fifth, a man on first and Miguel Cabrera coming up. Chicago replaced the left-hander with Jimmy Cordero, and the righty threw only one pitch, retiring Cabrera on a lineout to the shortstop.	White Sox manager Rick Renteria said he came close to leaving Gonzalez in.	"As I tell all my pitchers, when I think you're out of outs, I go get you," Renteria said. "It's best to make a move one pitch too soon than one pitch too late."	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox: Chicago reinstated SS Tim Anderson (strained right groin) from the injured list before the game and put INF Leury Garcia (sprained left thumb) on the IL. Anderson had a walk, a hit and two runs.	Tigers: Detroit put 1B C.J. Cron on the injured list before the game with a left knee sprain. Trainer Doug Teter said Cron has damage to a ligament and there is no timetable for his return.

NEW YORK --  Max Scherzer was grinding on the mound and grunting with each pitch, forced to work particularly hard just to get through the first two innings.	But he also looked healthy all the while -- a wonderful sign for the Washington Nationals.	Scherzer showed no effects of hamstring trouble, navigating heavy traffic early for his first win this season, and Trea Turner hit a record-breaking leadoff homer to help Washington beat the New York Mets 2-1 on Tuesday night.	"There were some big spots where the game really could have changed course there," Scherzer said. "I was able just to get some big strikeouts."	Howie Kendrick had three hits and Victor Robles blooped an RBI single for the World Series champions, who took the first two in a four-game series between NL East rivals.	New York (7-11) dropped to 3-7 at home this season.	"It's been frustrating. We've lost a lot of close games," Mets starter Rick Porcello said. "We just need something to get over the hump."	Porcello (1-2) threw six solid innings but was outpitched by Scherzer (1-1) in a matchup of Cy Young Award winners and former Detroit teammates. When they opposed each other in Washington last week, Porcello won 3-1 and Scherzer exited after only one inning because of a sore hamstring that first popped up before his previous outing.	The right-hander was confident it wasn't serious, and the Nationals said he felt good after a bullpen session between starts.	"I knew the hamstring wasn't going to be an issue," Scherzer said.	Grunting audibly while firing 95-96 mph fastballs to Wilson Ramos with the bases loaded, Scherzer needed a whopping 60 pitches to get through the initial two innings.	"I had 100-plus pitches in me, so I wasn't worried at all," he said. "Just continue to pound the zone."	He stranded five runners early by striking out Ramos to end the first and Jeff McNeil to close the second.	"Was just getting back in the swing of things after really not pushing for 13 days there," Scherzer said. "And you know, I give them credit. They had great ABs early in the game. They were able to grind me, and just a ton of foul balls."	Things turned for the three-time Cy Young Award winner when Dominic Smith lined into a double play to end the third. Scherzer lasted six innings and threw only 45 pitches over his final four to finish with 105. He gave up six hits, struck out seven and walked two.	"We were watching him. His mechanics were good, his location was a little off, but he felt good," Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. "We talked to him during the game and he said he felt fine. That last inning, he came in and said, `I still got a lot in the tank.'	"He started settling down, he started mixing his pitches up better. But he started getting the ball down in the strike zone and getting some swings and misses. He started throwing breaking pitches, which was nice."	Tanner Rainey tossed 1 2/3 hitless innings, getting McNeil to ground into an inning-ending double play with two on in the seventh.	Daniel Hudson struck out two in a 1-2-3 ninth for his third save, helped by an outstanding play from Turner at shortstop.	"Couldn't get that big hit," Mets manager Luis Rojas said.	Turner, who just announced with his wife that they're expecting a baby boy in February, drove Porcello's second pitch to right for an opposite-field shot that marked his second home run in two nights at Citi Field.	It was Turner's 10th career leadoff homer, a Nationals record. Alfonso Soriano hit nine in his lone season with Washington (2006). Brad Wilkerson holds the Expos/Nationals franchise mark with 15.	Impressive 21-year-old rookie Andres Gimenez tripled off the right-field wall against Scherzer in the fourth and scored on Luis Guillorme's sacrifice fly.	DYNAMIC DUO	The speedy Turner grounded into two double plays for the first time in his career, both turned by Guillorme and Gimenez.	"They were lightning fast," Porcello said.	Gimenez also made two other excellent plays at shortstop, including a sprawling stop on his backhand followed by a one-hop throw to first.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: Right-handed reliever Will Harris (groin strain) threw 17 pitches against hitters and "looked really good," according to Martinez.	Mets: RHP Brad Brach and RHP Walker Lockett (lower back discomfort) were reinstated from the injured list, adding fresh arms to a taxed bullpen. The return of Brach, who tested positive for COVID-19 upon arriving at summer camp, gave New York its full complement of projected relievers for the first time this season. RHP Paul Sewald and C Ali Sanchez were optioned to the alternate training site in Brooklyn. ... SS Amed Rosario sat out with a stomach bug. He was expected to be available off the bench. ... Slumping 1B Pete Alonso was rested for the first time this season. He flied out as a pinch-hitter in the seventh and stayed in the game. ... 2B Robinson Cano (left adductor strain) did some baserunning at Citi Field but it's too early to tell if he'll be ready to come off the IL when eligible Friday, Rojas said.	UP NEXT	Anibal Sanchez (0-2, 7.84 ERA) pitches Wednesday night for Washington. The Mets hadn't announced a starter to replace Michael Wacha, who went on the injured list Sunday with shoulder inflammation. Lockett could be a candidate.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.

BOSTON --  Mike Brosseau led off the game with a home run, Yandy Diaz and Hunter Renfroe each had two RBI and the Tampa Bay Rays continued their offensive onslaught against the Boston Red Sox in a 8-2 win Tuesday night.	Brosseau hit Boston starter Martin Perez's sixth pitch of the game into the Rays' bullpen in right for his first career leadoff homer.	"It's a good feeling knowing the manager has the confidence to put you in the leadoff spot," Brosseau said. "(Manager Kevin Cash) made a little joke with me prior to that first at-bat, about making him look good. I'm glad I was able to do that."	Brosseau, Diaz and Manuel Margot had multihit games as Tampa Bay won its fourth straight game. The Rays had a season-high 16 hits in an 8-7 win to open the four-game series Monday.	Tampa Bay starter Andrew Kittredge exited with right elbow soreness after throwing only five pitches. Kittredge was pitching in an opener role after recording the final two outs for his first career save on Monday.	"It was something I've never felt before. But as soon as I came out of the game it started to feel better," Kittredge said. "Feel great now, but the last pitch, just the forearm kind of tightened up there."	John Curtiss (1-0) pitched 2 2/3 innings of one-run ball in relief of Kittredge.	Michael Chavis and Alex Verdugo each hit RBI singles for the Red Sox. Perez (2-2) allowed two runs on three hits and struck out five in 5 2/3 innings after tossing five scoreless innings in a 5-0 win at Tampa Bay last Wednesday.	"We played a really good game for six innings," Red Sox manager Ron Roenicke said. "We didn't swing it again, but it was a good ballgame until then.	Boston has lost seven of its last 10.	"We've been struggling a little bit, but we still have games (left)," Perez said. "Just (have to) turn the page and put all the pieces together to find a way to win."	Willy Adames reached on a one-out single and was doubled in by Margot to begin a six-run seventh. Brandon Lowe pinch hit for Brosseau after Mike Zunino walked and lined an RBI double.	Diaz hit an RBI single, Lowe scored on a passed ball and Renfroe followed with a two-run double.	"We were able to get to their bullpen and just have big at-bat after big at-bat," Cash said. "Put a crooked number up there in one big inning that gave us some breathing room."	Chavis singled in the second and Verdugo singled in the eighth to produce the only Red Sox runs.	WE WANT THE CUP	The hand-operated Fenway Park scoreboard in left field hasn't listed out of town baseball scores with no fans present, but "Carolina vs. Bruins" was displayed in support of the Bruins' playoff series with the Hurricanes.	However, a yellow "P" was hung up on the board following the game's postponement to Wednesday after the Tampa Bay Lightning and Columbus Blue Jackets played to five overtimes at the Toronto bubble.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: Kittredge will be evaluated Wednesday and is day-to-day. . LHP Brendan McKay (undisclosed) was shut down for seven to 10 days due to shoulder irritation that dates back to last season. McKay was building up for a return when he began experiencing tightness. . RHP Yonny Chirinos (right triceps inflammation) played catch Tuesday and feels "really, really good," manager Cash said. Chirinos is on track to throw a bullpen session in the coming days.	Red Sox: 3B Rafael Devers (left ankle) was not in the lineup for a second straight game. Devers hit in the cage, fielded ground balls and did some running Tuesday. "He's doing way better," Roenicke said. . 1B Mitch Moreland returned after tweaking his left knee Sunday against Toronto. . LHP Josh Taylor (undisclosed) could return in a week while LHP Darwinzon Hernandez (undisclosed) is slightly behind his timetable.	UP NEXT	Rays: LHP Blake Snell (0-0, 3.38 ERA) seeks his first win of the season Wednesday. Cash said he's hoping for at least five innings out of the former AL Cy Young Award winner.	Red Sox: RHP Zack Godley (0-1, 3.97 ERA) will pitch on three days' rest, but Roenicke said the plan is for him to make more of a conventional start.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

MILWAUKEE --  Jedd Gyorko blasted a tiebreaking two-run homer in the eighth inning as the Milwaukee Brewers came from behind to beat the Minnesota Twins 6-4 on Tuesday.	The Brewers started their winning rally when Christian Yelich beat the Twins' shift with a one-out double. With the Twins moving their infield to the right against the left-handed hitter, Yelich responded by hitting a grounder up the third-base line and into left field.	Gyorko followed with a shot to center off Taylor Rogers (1-2). Twins center fielder Byron Buxton made a leaping attempt at a circus catch, but Gyorko's drive sailed over him.	"It felt good off the bat," Gyorko said. "I know that guy out there in center field for them pretty much catches everything. So, you've got to hit it about 10 feet past the fence or he's going to catch it. But off the bat, I thought it had a good chance and fortunately it went out."	Rogers entered in the eighth inning of a tie game one night after working the ninth to earn his fourth save.	"Rog has been so great for us," Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. "We're going to rely on Rog in absolutely the most important and biggest spots we can run into late in the game."	Eddie Rosario of the Twins and Manny Pina of the Brewers each hit two home runs. Minnesota's Jorge Polanco and Milwaukee's Avisail Garcia also homered.	Rosario, whose grand slam accounted for the Twins' only runs in their 4-2 victory at Milwaukee on Monday, helped give Minnesota a 4-1 lead by homering on his first two plate appearances. The Brewers rallied to tie the game because of Manny Pina's solo shot in the fifth and two-run blast in the sixth.	The Twins took a 2-0 lead in the first inning as Jorge Polanco and Rosario hit solo shots off Josh Lindblom that landed in a nearly identical spot just inside the right-field foul pole.	Milwaukee cut the deficit in half when Garcia led off the bottom of the first by homering to left off Tyler Clippard, who worked just one inning as the opener in a bullpen game for the Twins.	Garcia improved to 3 of 6 with three homers in his career against Clippard.	The Twins stretched out their lead in the third when Rosario homered to right after Nelson Cruz drew a leadoff walk.	Lindblom recorded a career-high eight strikeouts -- he had struck out seven in his last start -- but gave up those three homers in his four-inning stint. Alex Claudio, Eric Yardley, David Phelps, Devin Williams (1-1) and Josh Hader combined for five innings of shutout relief.	Hader walked one and struck out three in the ninth for his third save.	Pina sparked the Brewers' comeback. He led off the sixth by homering to left off Matt Wisler. The Brewers later got two-out singles from Orlando Arcia and Avisail Garcia to put runners on the corners, but Trevor May ended the threat by getting Keston Hiura to strike out looking.	On Pina's next trip to the plate, he blasted a 3-0 pitch from May over the wall in right-center for a two-run shot that tied the game at 4-all.	"I don't like swinging 3-0 because sometimes we try to swing too hard or something like that," Pina said. "Most of the time when I do it, it's a pop-out or ground ball. Then I see (third-base coach) Eddie (Sedar) and Eddie gives me the green light, `Swing the bat,' so I say OK, I'm going to swing, but the pitch has to be middle-middle. That's what I was looking for."	TRAINERS' ROOM	Twins: Catcher/infielder Willians Astudillo was activated from the 10-day injured list and optioned to the team's alternate training site. Astudillo had tested positive for COVID-19 when he reported to summer camp at the beginning of July.	Brewers: Milwaukee activated first baseman/outfielder Ryan Braun from the injured list and optioned utilityman Mark Mathias to the team's alternate training site.	Braun, who hadn't played since July 29 due to an infected right index finger, was in the starting lineup Tuesday as a designated hitter.	TWINS TRADE	The Twins acquired infielder Ildemaro Vargas from the Arizona Diamondbacks for cash considerations.	Vargas, 29, had gone 3 of 20 in eight games with Arizona before getting designated for assignment on Thursday. He batted .269 with six homers and 24 RBI in 92 games last season.	UP NEXT	Kenta Maeda (2-0, 2.65) pitches for the Twins, and Eric Lauer (0-1, 9.53) starts for the Brewers as this three-game series ends Wednesday at Milwaukee.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

DENVER --  Charlie Blackmon raised his batting average to an amazing .500 with three more hits, including a key double during a six-run burst in the eighth inning that led the Colorado Rockies over the Arizona Diamondbacks 8-7 Tuesday night.	After starting out the year 0 for 9, Blackmon has hit in 15 straight games. He's 34 for 68 through 17 games in the coronavirus-shortened 60-game season.	"It's special to watch. He's in a great place right now mentally and physically," Trevor Story said of Blackmon. "He hits the ball so hard. He's just driving it. It's cool to see what he can do in the three spot."	Blackmon doubled off Kevin Ginkel (0-1) during the Rockies' big inning that made it 8-2.	The Diamondbacks rallied for five runs in the ninth and had runners on first and third with two outs. Daniel Bard fanned pinch hitter Stephen Vogt to end it and earn his first save since 2011 while with the Boston Red Sox. It was his sixth career save overall.	Nolan Arenado hit a two-run homer and Raimel Tapia added three hits, including a two-run double in the eighth for Colorado.	Carlos Estevez (1-0) worked a scoreless eighth for the victory. Christian Walker and Carson Kelly each homered for the Diamondbacks.	Trailing 2-1, Arizona tied it when Kelly led off the seventh with his first home run of the season.	Colorado had gone in front 2-1 when Arenado followed Blackmon's second single of the night with a fourth-inning drive off Zac Gallen that soared into the stand of evergreens behind the center field fence. Walker, who hit 29 home runs as a rookie for the Diamondbacks last season, connected for his first of the season leading off the fourth inning to put Arizona up 1-0.	Gallen went seven innings and allowed two runs on seven hits, with seven strikeout and no walks. He set an NL record by allowing three or fewer earned runs in each of his first 19 starts. He eclipsed Steve Rogers of Montreal who didn't allow more than three earned runs in each of his first 18 career starts. Kyle Freeland went seven innings for Colorado and allowed two runs on seven hits. He struck out two and walked one. STREAK WITHIN A STREAK	Blackmon has six straight multihit games, tying the longest such streak of his career. He has done it three times, most recently in 2017, the same season he won the NL batting title with a .331 average. ROSTER MOVE	The Diamondbacks traded INF Ildemaro Vargas to the Minnesota Twins in exchange for cash. Vargas had been designated for assignment by Arizona last Thursday. UP NEXT Arizona RHP Luke Weaver (0-3, 12.19 ERA) returns to the mound seeking his first win of the season. He'll face RHP Antonio Senzatela (3-0, 2.65 ERA), who will be looking to extend his season-opening winning streak to four.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Nick Solak singled three times and drove in three runs, leading the Texas Rangers to a 4-2 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Tuesday night.	Solak had a two-run single in the first and an RBI hit in third, when Willie Calhoun added another run-scoring single. Calhoun's hit scored slugger Joey Gallo, who was hit by a pitch twice and walked his other two times up.	Left-hander Mike Minor allowed an infield single and three walks with four strikeouts in four scoreless innings but was pulled after 76 pitches with the Rangers trying to solve a dip in velocity from his previous start.	Manager Chris Woodward said before the game he wanted to get Minor out before the velocity dropped again in hopes of restoring longer outings for the 32-year-old with a history of shoulder problems. The Rangers said Minor had no issues.	"He talked me into going back out for the fourth," Woodward said after the game. "It wasn't a health concern to not let him go back out. It was just more of what we had talked about before the game. Still tried to beg me to go out for the fifth. I had to be the bad guy to not let him."	Minor's fastball stayed in the low 90 mph range after dropping into the 80s when he allowed five runs in five innings in a 6-4 loss at Oakland. His ERA was 6.89 coming into the game.	"Arm felt better. Body felt better," Minor said. "I felt more free and easy."	Edinson Volquez (2-1) was awarded the win by the official scorer after replacing Nick Goody and allowing a single before getting the final out the fifth inning. Goody replaced Minor and allowed both Seattle runs, one of them unearned.	Joely Rodriguez, Jonathan Hernandez and Rafael Montero combined to retire the final 12 Seattle hitters, with Montero getting his third save.	Kyle Seager singled twice to become the active player with the most hits against Texas at 179. He passed Mike Trout (177). J.P. Crawford had the only RBI for the Mariners on a fifth-inning single.	Seattle starter Marco Gonzales (2-2) gave up seven hits and four runs in five innings.	"I thought our at-bats were really good early in the game," Seattle manager Scott Servais said. "We didn't get the big hit. Their bullpen threw really well and had good stuff and they executed. So that's going to happen on certain nights."	COVID-RELATED ROSTER MOVE	The Rangers put right-handed reliever Luke Farrell on the injured list because of close contact with a person who tested positive for COVID-19. The son of former Toronto and Boston manager John Farrell has tested negative for the virus. The close contact didn't occur outside his home. Farrell has no record and a 13.50 ERA in three appearances.	Texas signed infielder Derek Dietrich to a major league contract and added him to the active roster while selecting left-hander Wes Benjamin from the alternate training site. Right-hander Jimmy Herget and infielder Anderson Tejeda were optioned to the alternate training site. First baseman Greg Bird was activated and designated for assignment.	TURNING BACK TIME	Starting Aug. 24, the Rangers are going back to 7:05 p.m. starts local time for the seven remaining games against West Coast teams that had been scheduled for 8:05 p.m. Central time. The original change was made for fans in the Pacific time zone during the pandemic-shortened season, with the reciprocal agreement of 6:05 p.m. Pacific starts when Texas played out West.	Texas requested the switch back for its TV viewers and radio listeners (no fans are allowed in stadiums). It was approved by Major League Baseball and the visiting teams. The switch affects four games against Oakland, two against the Los Angeles Angels and one against the Dodgers.	4-BASE ERROR STANDS	The Rangers had their appeal denied over a rare four-base error against Angels right fielder Jo Adell after a fly ball from Solak popped out of the rookie's glove and over the fence in a 7-3 Texas win Sunday.	The official scorer originally ruled it a home run, but changed it after consulting with the Elias Sports Bureau. Elias said it was unaware of any previous four-base error on a ball that went over the fence.	UP NEXT	Seattle RHP Taijuan Walker (1-2, 5.79 ERA) is scheduled to face RHP Jordan Lyles (1-1, 5.56) in the finale of a three-game series. It's the last of 20 straight games without a day off to start the season for the Mariners.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

HOUSTON --  The San Francisco Giants were confident that Hunter Pence would break out of his slump and get going this season.	The 37-year-old finally did that in grand fashion on Tuesday night, and it helped the Giants rally for 7-6 a win over the Houston Astros in 10 innings.	Brandon Crawford hit an RBI single in the 10th inning to lift San Francisco to the victory. But before that it was Pence, who was mired in a 2 for 32 start, who came through for the Giants.	Houston led by 4 with two outs in the seventh when Pence, who began his career in Houston, hit a three-run pinch-hit homer off Blake Taylor to cut the lead to 6-5. It was the first home run this season for Pence.	"We were all pretty happy for Hunter," manager Gabe Kapler said. "Obviously that changed the game for us and put us right back where we needed to be."	Pence, who added a single in the ninth, said the Giants showed the identity of their team with Tuesday's comeback.	"That's kind of been something that we've done pretty well here at the start of the season is we've been scoring a lot of runs late," he said. "We do have a team mindset of keep fighting, be as scrappy as we can. ... Just having everyone with that mindset, and having good at-bats."	Austin Slater singled off Cy Sneed (0-3) to start the 10th and send Wilmer Flores to third after he started on second under the new extra-innings rules. Crawford then followed with his grounder to center field to score Flores.	Trevor Gott (1-0) walked one in a scoreless ninth for the win and Tyler Rogers struck out two in a perfect 10th for his first save.	An RBI single by Darin Ruf off Ryan Pressly with one out in the ninth tied it at 6-all.	Flores also homered for the Giants, who snapped a six-game losing streak to the Astros.	Alex Bregman homered for the Astros as they lost for the sixth time in seven games.	Houston got a win in Monday's opener after losing five straight, capped by a 7-2 defeat at Oakland on Sunday that was marred by a benches-clearing brawl. Hitting coach Alex Cintron received a 20-game suspension and a fine on Tuesday for his role in the incident and what MLB said was: "inciting and escalating the conflict between the two clubs."	Oakland outfielder Ramon Laureano was given a six-game suspension and a fine for charging the Astros dugout toward Cintron. Laureano is appealing his suspension, but Cintron accepted his and began serving it Tuesday night.	San Francisco starter Tyler Anderson yielded five hits and four runs while walking three in five innings.	Houston rookie Brandon Bielak allowed six hits and two runs in five innings in his second major league start after making two relief appearances.	Houston manager Dusty Baker lamented his bullpen's inability to close the game out after a solid start by Bielak.	"This is tough, just tough to take," Baker said. "We had the right guys out there at the right time, but we didn't get the job done."	Flores gave the Giants a 1-0 lead with a homer in the second.	Martin Maldonado doubled with one out in the second to score Kyle Tucker, who had tripled, and tie it at 1-all.	Josh Reddick hit a two RBI double to center field with two outs that Mike Yastrzemski almost caught, but instead deflected, to make it 3-1.	There were no outs in the third when Bregman sent a fastball from Anderson to left field to extend the lead to 4-1.	Alex Dickerson hit an RBI single to center field with two outs in the fifth to cut the lead to 4-2.	Myles Straw hit a run-scoring single down the third base line with two outs in the sixth and Jose Altuve followed with a single that sent home another run to make it 6-2.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Giants: 2B/INF Donovan Solano was held out of the lineup as a precaution after he experienced some abdominal soreness following Monday's game, manager Gabe Kapler said. Solano is batting .458 with a home run and 15 RBI. Kapler said they'll evaluate him on Wednesday to see if he can return.	Astros: OF George Springer missed his fifth game with a strained right wrist, but was Houston's runner on second base in the 10th inning. Baker said Springer would likely start on Friday, but could be in the lineup Wednesday.	LONG BALLS	The Giants have allowed 29 home runs this year, which ranks second in the majors behind Arizona (40). Tuesday was the 15th straight game in which they have allowed a home run, which is the longest streak in franchise history.	UP NEXT	Houston's Zack Greinke (0-0, 3.00 ERA) will oppose Trevor Cahill when the series wraps up on Wednesday night. Greinke allowed five hits in six scoreless innings in his last start but did not factor in the decision in a 3-2 loss to the Athletics in 13 innings. Cahill will make his debut after missing time because of a fingernail issue on his right index finger.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Dylan Bundy threw seven scoreless innings of four-hit ball in another superb start, Jason Castro hit a three-run homer and the Los Angeles Angels won back-to-back games for the first time this season, 6-0 over the Oakland Athletics on Tuesday night.	Anthony Rendon, Castro and Brian Goodwin homered in the fourth off Mike Fiers (1-1), and David Fletcher homered in the sixth inning to give the Angels back-to-back home games with at least four homers for the first time in franchise history.	That was more than enough offense for Bundy (3-1), who struck out 10 with one walk while dropping his ERA to 1.57 over a major league-leading 28 2/3 innings. The right-hander has been mostly fantastic in four starts since the Angels acquired him from Baltimore for four minor leaguers last December.	"I'm feeling pretty good, as good as I can right now," Bundy said. "If you're throwing the ball good, the confidence is high. You just try to stay in the middle and not get too high, not get too low."	Bundy has thrown 12 consecutive scoreless innings, and he has yielded only nine hits and two walks against 25 strikeouts in his last 20 innings. He threw the Angels' first complete game since June 2018 last week in Seattle, and he followed up with a second straight 10-strikeout game against the A's superior lineup.	"It's the real deal," Angels manager Joe Maddon said of Bundy's stuff, which is highlighted by a wicked slider and an improved changeup. "The pitches are good, the swings are not sharp and the takes are bad. Everything he's doing right now, I don't know the last time he's pitched this well. It's just interesting to watch. He's set the bar really high."	Fiers yielded seven hits and five runs while failing to get out of the fourth inning for the AL West-leading A's, who have lost two straight since arriving in Anaheim with a nine-game winning streak.	"I would say it's top three in baseball," Fiers said of the Angels' lineup. "It's definitely scary. Guys at the top just get on base. They find ways on for the big guys, (Mike) Trout, (Shohei) Ohtani and Rendon. It's a very tough lineup."	Rendon's 408-foot solo shot to the bullpens beyond the left field fence got the Angels' offense started. The Halos' new $245 million third baseman is finally heating up with homers in consecutive games.	After Ohtani and Albert Pujols singled, Castro -- the Angels' new catcher and an East Bay native -- brought them home with his second homer of the season off the fake rock pile beyond center field.	OHTANI RISING	Ohtani went 2 for 4 with a walk and a stolen base. The two-way star has six hits and three walks in his last three games, and he's batting .318 with two homers, four walks and five runs in the week since he strained his right forearm and returned to a full-time designated hitter role for the rest of the season.	"He's still not there 100%," Maddon said. "He's gotten better, but he's still not where he's going to be in a couple of days or a week."	LONG STRETCH	The A's were playing for the 12th consecutive day and for the 18th day out of 19 since the regular season began. Weariness isn't an excuse, they say.	"We knew what kind of season we're getting ourselves into when we started," left fielder Robbie Grossman said. "We're all up for the challenge, and we're looking forward to come back tomorrow."	AWAKENED BATS	The Angels' lineup is finally clicking after hitting miserably during LA's 5-11 start. Trout's two homers led the Angels' four-homer barrage in the series opener Monday, and the Angels followed up by hitting at least four homers in back-to-back games for the fifth time in franchise history.	SUSPENSION PENDING	Ramon Laureano went 1 for 3 with two strikeouts for the A's after appealing his six-game suspension handed down Tuesday for his role in Oakland's fight with the Astros last weekend.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels RF Jo Adell got the day off, but Maddon personally put the 21-year-old rookie through a rigorous outfield workout before Tuesday's game. ... SS Andrelton Simmons went through a full workout Monday for the first time since spraining his ankle. Maddon doesn't know when he'll be back.	UP NEXT	Griffin Canning (0-2, 3.14 ERA) takes the mound for Los Angeles in the series finale against Chris Bassitt (1-0, 1.08 ERA). Canning hasn't been rewarded despite allowing only five earned runs in his three starts, while Bassitt has allowed one run or fewer in all three of his starts.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

LOS ANGELES --  Manny Machado slugged a grand slam after two consecutive errors by the Dodgers in the third inning, Garrett Richards won for the first time in two years, and the San Diego Padres defeated Los Angeles 6-2 on Tuesday night.	The Padres have taken the first two games of the series after dropping two of three to the Dodgers last week in San Diego, and have won a season-best three in a row overall.	"We're just trying to be the best team when we step out on the field every single day," Machado said. "Whether it was the Dodgers, Colorado, San Fran, Arizona. Just go out there and play our best game. Try to be the best Padre team out there on the field. If we can do that, we can play some very good baseball."	Richards (1-1) won his first game since July 4, 2018, shortly before having Tommy John surgery that delayed his readiness for the 2019 season. The right-hander allowed one run and six hits in six innings. He struck out three and walked two.	Drew Pomeranz got the final out to earn his fourth save.	Machado's 10th career slam came off Ross Stripling (3-1) not long after the Padres acquired his brother-in-law, first baseman Yonder Alonso from Atlanta for $1. Alonso returns to San Diego, where he played from 2012-15 and Machado and Alonso's sister make their offseason home.	"I'm definitely excited to have my brother-in-law finally on the same team," Machado said.	Jurickson Profar hit a solo shot on Stripling's second pitch leading off the fifth, extending San Diego's lead to 6-1. The Padres' 32 homers lead the majors.	Jake Cronenworth doubled leading off the third. Austin Hedges laid down a sacrifice bunt and Stripling's throw was too high for 6-foot-5 Cody Bellinger at first, allowing Cronenworth to score on the pitcher's error. Profar followed with a sacrifice bunt picked up by third baseman Justin Turner, whose throw pulled Bellinger off the bag. The Dodgers had committed four errors this season until two in a row in the inning.	"It just stinks that inning got away from us," Stipling said. "Shot-putting a ball over Cody when I had a chance for a free out. I clawed it and had all the time in the world and felt a little rushed when I didn't have a good grip on it."	Fernando Tatis Jr. showed bunt before rifling a single to load the bases and extend his hitting streak to nine games. Trent Grisham grounded into a fielder's choice to third and Hedges was out at the plate. That set up Machado's blast and gave the Padres a 5-1 lead.	"He's starting to find the sweet part of the bat a little bit," Padres manager Jayce Tingler said. "Being able to go dead center right there and drive the ball to the middle part of the field, that's usually a good sign of good things to come as well. There was a lot of energy in the dugout after that."	The Dodgers' offensive woes continued, best illustrated by Bellinger. He bounced into two double plays that ended innings. Then fouled a ball off his right foot and fell down in the sixth before a flyout to left. The current NL MVP was 5 for 36 at the plate in July and is 7 for 36 this month. His .176 average is the lowest in the starting lineup.	"You have to drown that noise, that batting average out of your head," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. "Each team is pitching him different, these guys were trying to crowd him. He's battling, he's grinding. There are some balls that he squared up that just seemed to be at 'em balls. It's going to come."	Turner scored on Chris Taylor's RBI single with two outs in the second. The Dodgers didn't score again until Austin Barnes' RBI single with two outs in the ninth.	Stripling gave up six runs and six hits in 4 2/3 innings of his first loss of the season. He struck out four and walked two.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: SS Corey Seager completed baseball activities for the second straight day. He's been sidelined for nearly a week because of lower back discomfort. "It's going to be a slow progression," Roberts said. The team is still considering putting him on the IL, but hasn't made a decision yet.	BACK TO CALI	Alonso was on the Braves' restricted list after not reporting to their alternate training site. He will report to the Padres' alternate site at the University of San Diego. The Padres will send cash to the Braves to complete the deal.	"He can help out the young guys, definitely help out this team," Machado said. "It's a big opportunity for him, big opportunity for us to have a guy like that on our ball club. A big left-handed bat off the bench and can play some first base. That's something that we definitely needed on this ball club."	1,000 HITS	Turner notched his 1,000th career base hit with a double off the wall in left leading off the second. He signaled to ask for the ball to be saved. He's the first Dodger to reach that mark since Machado did so while with Los Angeles on Aug. 9, 2018. Turner is 16 RBI from reaching 500 for his career.	UP NEXT	Padres: RHP Zach Davies (2-1, 2.87 ERA) retired his first 13 batters against the Diamondbacks last week. He allowed three singles in 5 2/3 innings and struck out six.	Dodgers: RHP Tony Gonsolin (0-0) makes his second spot start of the season in place of LHP Julio Urias, who was pushed back to Thursday to give him an extra day of rest.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.

DETROIT --  From the first plate appearance of the game, Tim Anderson made this a long day for the opposing pitchers.	Anderson homered to cap a 10-pitch at-bat leading off the first inning, and Luis Robert added a bases-clearing double in the fifth to lift the Chicago White Sox to a 7-5 victory over the Detroit Tigers on Wednesday.	Anderson had four hits and finished a double shy of the cycle, and the White Sox have won two in a row since he returned from a groin injury.	"Energizer Bunny, baby," Anderson said. "Just my presence, being in that lineup definitely made the guys go and made the other team scared."	Anderson and Eloy Jimenez led off the game with consecutive home runs. Jonathan Schoop and Willi Castro homered for the Tigers, who scored four unearned runs in the fourth before Matthew Boyd (0-2) gave the lead right back.	Anderson, who led the majors in batting last year at .335, fouled off six straight two-strike pitches before his first-inning homer. He had a triple, too, by the end of the third inning and added two singles before striking out on three pitches in the eighth.	Dylan Cease (3-1) allowed one earned run and seven hits in six innings. Three Chicago relievers held Detroit scoreless, with Alex Colome working a perfect ninth for his fifth save in five chances.	Both teams took advantage of extra opportunities in their big innings. Detroit's Victor Reyes reached base on a passed ball on a third strike, and that came back to haunt the White Sox when Grayson Greiner hit a two-out, two-run double that tied the game at 3 in the fourth.	Castro followed with a two-run homer.	But the Tigers let Boyd, their opening day starter, labor well into the fifth, and Chicago eventually broke through. Anderson played a big role again. After leading off the inning with a single, he moved to second on a walk and hustled to third when Edwin Encarnacion hit a slow grounder to shortstop Niko Goodrum.	Anderson rounded the bag a bit, which caught Goodrum's attention, and the Tigers didn't get any outs on the play. It was scored a fielder's choice. Boyd ended up one out short of escaping the jam. Robert's drive off the wall in right-center field scored three runs. Nomar Mazara added an RBI double to make it 7-5 and finally chase the Detroit left-hander.	"I know I need to be better. There's been inconsistencies and usually it's centered around me trying to overthrow right now," Boyd said. "I'm continuing to work on that. The main thing is I was falling behind on some guys."	MIDDLE INNINGS	In Tuesday night's win over the Tigers, Chicago manager Rick Renteria pulled starter Gio Gonzalez with one out to go in the fifth, costing him a chance at a win. Gonzalez didn't seem thrilled about it, but when the Tigers stuck with their starter in the fifth a day later, it backfired.	"We scored four runs on your pitcher, Matty needs to go out there and get a shutdown inning but he couldn't get through the inning, finish off the hitters," Detroit manager Ron Gardenhire said. "He had a couple of times to finish them off and pitches got away from him and there you have it. They put four right back on."	Cease, meanwhile, recovered from his rough fourth inning and made it through six for the second time in three starts.	"It's huge to be able to save bullpen arms, for one, and for me personally to get that deep," he said. "It means a lot to me."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: 1B C.J. Cron (sprained knee) said before the game that surgery has been discussed, but it may be able to wait. At this point, he's going to try to come back and finish the year.	UP NEXT	The Tigers are off Thursday. Then Detroit starts a home series against Cleveland on Friday night, with RHP Ivan Nova (1-0) facing Indians RHP Aaron Civale (1-2).	The next scheduled game for Chicago is at home Friday night against St. Louis, although the Cardinals haven't played since July 29 because of issues they've been having with the coronavirus.	---	Follow Noah Trister at https://twitter.com/noahtrister	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

DENVER --  Starling Marte homered and drove in four runs as the Arizona Diamondbacks battered the Colorado Rockies 13-7 Wednesday in a Coors Field slugfest featuring 34 hits, but none by blistering Charlie Blackmon.	Blackmon began the game batting an astonishing .500 for the Rockies. He went 0 for 4, ending his hitting streak at 15 games, and his average dipped to .472.	Blackmon was on deck when Trevor Story, who doubled twice and singled, grounded into a game-ending double play.	Nolan Arenado homered twice and doubled for the Rockies.	Marte had three hits, including a go-ahead single in an eight-run seventh inning. It was 5-all going into the inning.	"It was about time," said David Peralta, who helped break the game open in the seventh with a three-run double. "We were finding some holes. We've been hitting the ball really well but couldn't find the hole. This just happened. So when this kind of thing happens it's fun. It's fun when you do the right thing and things go your way. We just have to keep it up. "	Nick Ahmed had three hits and a pair of RBI and Kole Calhoun added three hits with an RBI for the Diamondbacks, who took two of three to deny Colorado its sixth consecutive series win to start the season.	Ryan McMahon, swinging on a 3-0 count, connected for a three-run homer to chase Arizona starter Luke Weaver with one out in the fourth inning.	"I thought I hit some spots pretty well, got a little unlucky on some positioning, where we position our guys in the right way, and they just found some holes today," Weaver said. "And that 3-0, that's an interesting count. You're trying to get back in the count and he sold out to the pitch and got one."	It was the first home run by a Rockies player on a 3-0 count since Michael Cuddyer did it at Atlanta on on May 24, 2014.	"Honestly, the best part about it was Skip (manager Bud Black) giving me the green light there," said McMahon, who has struggled with strikeouts this season. He has 28 on the season, including three more around his homer and single.	"To be really honest, I've just felt really lost," McMahon added. "I haven't had a great feel for the (strike zone) which is usually something I take a lot of pride in. It's hard for me right now."	Garrett Hampson added a career-high four hits for the Rockies. A total of 11 players had multihit games, seven with at least three hits.	Andrew Chafin (1-0) picked up the win with an inning of scoreless relief.	With the score tied at 5 in the the seventh, the Diamondbacks erupted. Peralta struck the key blow with a three-run double off Tyler Kinley (0-1), who did not retire any of the five batters he faced. Ahmed and Calhoun each had a pair of hits in the inning.	Arizona homered in a club-record 16th straight game at Coors Field and improved to 9-3 in its last 12 against the Rockies.	Colorado starter Antonio Senzatela went six innings and allowed five runs on nine hits.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rockies: INF Chris Owings left the game after the second inning because of tightness in his left hamstring. Hampson moved from center field to second base to replace him and Sam Hilliard entered the game to replace Hampson in center. . RHP Scott Oberg, who's been sidelined since the start of the season by a back injury and a recurrence of blood clot issues in his pitching arm, has been undergoing a series of tests but there's no timetable for his return. Oberg has dealt with vascular problems in his arm twice previously, missing time in August 2019 and August 2016. Manager Bud Black said he spoke with Oberg earlier Wednesday and the reliever was in good spirits and expected to return home to the Philadelphia area soon to undergo additional tests. However, he remains sidelined indefinitely. "There's really no clear path to what is going to happen with Scott," Black said.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: Arizona has an off day Thursday followed by a season-high 17 straight games before their next off day on Aug. 31. RHP Merrill Kelly (2-1, 2.29) is slated to start Friday night's series opener in Arizona against the San Diego Padres, whose starter is to be determined.	Rockies: Following an off day Thursday, the Rockies begin a stretch of 20 games in 20 days starting Friday night in a series opener against the Texas Rangers. Colorado RHP Ryan Castellani (0-0, 0.00 ERA) is slated to start against the Rangers' RHP Lance Lynn (2-0, 1.16 ERA).	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Oakland manager Bob Melvin didn't know until an hour before Wednesday's game against the Los Angeles Angels whether Ramon Laureano would be available.	After finding out that Major League Baseball wouldn't decide on his appeal of a six-game suspension, the Athletics center fielder helped his team avert a series sweep.	Laureano made three sensational catches in Oakland's 8-4 victory. The Athletics got three home runs and solid pitching from starter Chris Bassitt, but it was Laureano's glove work that ended up making the difference.	"He's a Gold Glove center fielder, no doubt. He won us the game defensively," said Bassitt, who improved to 2-0 after going 5 2/3 innings. "I know we won it by a couple more runs, but he definitely saved us."	Laureano made web gems in three straight innings and with the Athletics hanging on to a one-run lead. He made a sliding catch to rob Jo Adell of a single in the fifth and then made leaping grabs at the wall to rob Tommy La Stella and Brian Goodwin of extra-base hits in the sixth and seventh.	Oakland then broke it open with three runs in the eighth.	"I obviously wish he started serving his suspension today. Those were great plays, He was probably the biggest difference in today's game," Angels manager Joe Maddon said.	Melvin said he expects Laureano's suspension for his role in Sunday's benches-clearing brawl against the Houston Astros to begin Friday,. He was just happy to have him for at least one more game.	"I enjoy watching him play. He's energetic. He knows how many steps it is to the wall. He's really confident doing it," Melvin said. "Anytime you leave your feet it's not an easy play, but he made it look easy. He timed it so well."	Laureano said the familiarity with the Angel Stadium outfield because it is a division opponent and the ballpark having short walls ended up benefiting him.	"The outfield here is pretty short, so I always feel good here playing the outfield," he said. "Both (catches at the wall) were difficult especially when the sky is the way it is here in Anaheim. I don't pay too much attention. I just want to catch the ball and that's it, make it simple."	Stephen Piscotty, Matt Olson and Robbie Grossman homered for Oakland. Piscotty put the A's ahead with his solo drive in the fourth inning. Olson and Grossman also went deep off Griffin Canning (0-3) as Oakland's offense bounced back after being shut out on Tuesday night.	Seven of the Athletics' nine hits were for extra bases, including a pair of doubles by Matt Chapman.	Bassitt (2-0) threw his third straight win against the Angels. The right-hander came in with only two earned runs allowed in 16 2/3 innings but gave up four runs on five hits while striking out four.	Mike Trout and Anthony Rendon hit solo homers for the Angels, who went deep 10 times in the three-game series. Los Angeles came into the game tied with San Diego for most homers in the majors with 20.	Olson opened the scoring three batters into the game with a 454-foot blast into the elevated stands in right-center. Trout evened it in the bottom of the first when he put Bassitt's sinker over the wall in right-center.	Grossman made it 3-1 in the second with a two-run shot to right-center but Los Angeles evened it in the third on La Stella's RBI single and a sacrifice fly by Trout.	Piscotty then gave the Athletics the lead for good when he drove Canning's curveball down the left-field line.	Canning allowed four runs on six hits and struck out two. All four of his home runs allowed this season have been to Oakland.	"They weren't chasing stuff which they normally do. It seems like they were on everything he was throwing," said Maddon of Canning.	BOUNCING BACK	Rendon's drive to center in the sixth inning pulled the Angels within 5-4 and gave him a homer in three straight games for the second time in his career. The other time was in 2017 for Washington.	The third baseman -- who signed a seven-year, $245 million contract during the offseason -- came into the series with a .103 batting average and an 0 for 21 hitless streak but went 5 for 11 with three home runs and five RBI in the series.	Rendon's blast was the Angels' 10th homer of the series, which ties a franchise record for most in a three-game home series. They also had 10 in a 1994 series against the Chicago White Sox and 2014 vs. the New York Mets.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: SS Andrelton Simmons (ankle) took some at-bats against live pitching at the alternate training site in Long Beach on Wednesday. While manager Joe Maddon is optimistic that Simmons could return for this weekend's series against the Dodgers, Simmons said he is a bit more cautious. He said during the game that he still doesn't feel quite ready yet.	UP NEXT	Athletics: Get an off day on Thursday before going across the bay to face San Francisco in a three-game weekend series. RHP Frankie Montas (2-1, 1.57 ERA) gets the call in Friday's opener.	Angels: Remain home to host the Los Angeles Dodgers this weekend in the Freeway Series. LHP Patrick Sandoval (0-1, 2.70 ERA) gets his first career start against the Dodgers on Friday.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

"I mean, I've got a good team," David Ross said. "That's what it is. We've got good players."	Kyle Hendricks pitched six strong innings in his first appearance against Cleveland since Game 7 of the 2016 World Series and Anthony Rizzo homered, leading the Cubs to a 7-2 win over the Indians on Wednesday night to match their best start in 50 years.	Hendricks (3-1) didn't have much trouble with the slumping Indians, who came in batting a major league-worst .192. He allowed one run and seven hits -- threw 18 straight strikes in one juncture -- and handled everyone in Cleveland's lineup but Franmil Reyes, who got three hits.	The Cubs are 12-3 in their first season under Ross, matching the club's start after 15 games in 1970.	Since taking over, Ross has preached about being positive and energetic and the constant chatter coming Chicago's dugout is evidence his players are listening.	"There is nothing to complain about because the talent's there, the character's there, the commitment, the focus, the energy, the work," Ross said. "It's not easy, especially in the environment we're dealing with now. I've got really good players, man.	"I just put them in the lineup and I start trying to cheerlead them on. They're really good."	Rizzo homered in the third off Carlos Carrasco (2-2), David Bote drove in two runs and Kris Bryant connected for a 430-foot shot as the Cubs swept the two-game interleague set.	Hendricks hadn't faced the Indians since Nov. 2, 2016, when he started the dramatic finale as the Cubs beat the Indians in extra innings to clinch their first Series title since 1908. The right-hander is as efficient now as he was four years ago.	"I'm just happy that we are where we are right now," he said. "You never know why things click at a certain time. I think we missed baseball so much being out for so long that it just gave us that little breather, and guys are really just excited to be around each other and excited to be playing the game again."	Carrasco was pulled in the fifth after a shaky, seven-walk outing over 4 1/3 innings. The right-hander struggled with his control from the outset, but he was able to work around two, two-walk innings without giving up any runs.	"He was really yanking a lot of fastballs to the lefties and away to the righties," manager Terry Francona said. "Shoot, he was probably in the fourth inning and his strike-to-ball was even. There were a lot of walks. He was pitching out of danger the entire time."	It's been a tough few days for the Indians.	Not only are they struggling to score, but they're still sorting through the situation with starters Mike Clevinger and Zach Plesac, who broke team rules and COVID-19 protocols when they left the team hotel in Chicago last weekend and risked exposure to the virus.	Francona did not say if the players have yet been tested. And as for their fractured relationship with teammates, Francona said that could take time to heal.	"I know that they've got some trust to earn back and they're gonna have to earn that back," he said. "I don't know how easy that will be."	SHORT STORIES	Francisco Lindor and Javier Baez followed eerily similar paths to stardom. Both were born in Puerto Rico, moved to Florida and were drafted one pick apart in 2011.	They're close friends and two of the game's best middle infielders. Just ask Jason Kipnis, who played with Lindor in Cleveland and is teammates with Baez.	"They're both better at baseball than me," he said. "I don't know what's in the water over there, but these guys' natural ability to play this game is astonishing. "	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: OF Kyle Schwarber was scratched from the starting lineup with a bruised right knee suffered when he got hit with a pitch Tuesday. He struck out pinch-hitting in the ninth. ... Ross said feedback was positive on LHP Jose Quintana's simulated game. He cut his pitching hand while washing dishes at home last month. There is still no timetable for his return.	Indians: C Roberto Perez (shoulder) has been running and throwing at the team's alternate site in Lake County. Francona said Perez has not suffered any setbacks and the club could have him back soon.	UP NEXT	Cubs: Open a 10-game, 11-day homestand on Thursday against Milwaukee with Yu Darvish (2-1) starting against Brewers left-hander Brett Anderson (0-1).	Indians: Following their second off day in four days, Cleveland opens a three-game series in Detroit on Friday. Aaron Civale (1-2) starts the opener against Ivan Nova (1-0).	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.

BUFFALO, N.Y. --  If Magneuris Sierra and the Miami Marlins were looking for special souvenirs to bring home from their extra long road trip, they found them with a big extra-inning win and a hold on first place.	Sierra hit a go-ahead single in the 10th inning and the Marlins overcame Toronto's seven home runs to outlast the Blue Jays 14-11 Wednesday night in the final game of their season-opening, three-week odyssey.	"It seems like the perfect game to end this trip, a game out of the ordinary," Marlins manager Don Mattingly said.	After this detour to Sahlen Field, Miami finally gets to play its pandemic-delayed opener at Marlins Park.	Miami has an off day before facing Atlanta for three games to start a seven-game homestand. The Marlins' grueling road swing began with a trip to Atlanta on July 21 for a pair of exhibition games and moved on to Philadelphia for a season-opening, three-game series.	The Marlins, however, had their return home delayed when an outbreak of COVID-19 occurred, forcing seven games to be postponed and a quarantine in Philadeelphia.	Despite the travel woes, the Marlins have had at least a share of first place in the NL East every day so far this season.	"This trip had a little bit of everything, right? We've hung in there. We've played pretty good ball," Mattingly said. "We had a disaster at the beginning in Philly. I don't know how to describe it."	"We had a fire alarm at the hotel last night at midnight. It just goes on and on, right? And then this game. It was a good trip from the standpoint of wins."	Up 8-0 early, the Marlins watched Toronto rally to tie it. Marlins outfielder Jon Berti scored on Sierra's two-run single that made it 13-11.	"It will be exciting to get home and play in Miami," Berti said. "What we went through is only going to make us stronger."	Bo Bichette went 5 for 5 for the Blue Jays, a day after homering during a 10-inning win in their first game at their new Buffalo home. He connected again as Toronto became the fourth team in major league history to lose while slugging at least seven homers.	The Marlins. meanwhile, are the first National League team to win a game while allowing seven home runs.	Jesus Aguilar drove in four runs with three hits, including an RBI single in the 10th.	Travis Shaw hit two homers for the Blue Jays, including the 100th of his career. Teoscar Hernandez, Rowdy Tellez and Danny Jansen each hit two-run homers while Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Bichette added solo shots. The last time a team lost while hitting at least seven homers came when the Chicago White Sox hit seven and fell to Toronto on June 25, 2016.	According to Stats by STATS, the Blue Jays are the first team in MLB history to have at least 18 hits and seven home runs in a game and still lose. In addition, Bichette became the first shortstop in the modern era to reach base safely six times, hit a home run and steal two bases in the same game.	"It was great to see us coming back, and knowing what we can do," Toronto manager Charlie Montoyo said. "We didn't make the plays and those guys have been playing good. They took advantage and we didn't make the plays or the big pitches after the errors. We paid the price."	Toronto last hit at least seven homers when they struck for eight in a 17-11 win against Tampa Bay on Aug 7, 2010.	Brian Anderson hit a three-run homer in the Miami first.	The two games in Buffalo might suggest that there's a jetstream in the ballpark which, along with the win, could be enough to give the Marlins' plane home a good push forward after squandering a big lead.	Bichette, who previously played at the field for Toronto's Triple-A affiliate, didn't agree.	"We just hit the ball well tonight," Bichette said. "I don't think this park is doing us any favors, When I was here, it wasn't necessarily a hitters' park. I think every ball we hit (tonight) would have been out (of the park) anywhere."	Brandon Kintzler (1-0) pitched 1 1/3 innings to earn the win. Josh Smith, the ninth pitcher utilized by the Marlins, worked the 10th and earned his first save.	Bichette drew a walk in the 10th, giving the Blue Jays two on with no outs, but Smith escaped the jam. Bichette is 13 for 29 (.448) during a seven-game hitting streak.	Rafael Doliz (0-1) took the loss.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: Some of the Marlins players who were placed on the injured list last week following a COVID-19 outbreak have applied for reinstatement. "How long that takes, I'm not sure," Mattingly said before the game. ... Reliever Mike Morin left the game after delivering only two pitches in the sixth inning. He retired Randal Grichuk on his first pitch and got a strike on Tellez, but arched his back with an apparent upper-body concern.	UP NEXT	Marlins: Friday's return home will feature right-hander Pablo Lopez (1-1, 1.80 ERA) taking on Braves righthander Kyle Wright (0-2, 6.75).	Blue Jays: After an off day on Thursday, Toronto will host Tampa Bay for a three-game series, with righthander Tanner Roark (1-1, 5.63) facing starting against fellow righty Tyler Glasnow (0-1, 5.56) for the Rays.	-----	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

CINCINNATI --  Bases loaded, one out, another close game on the verge of slipping away. The strain showed on Mike Matheny's face in the ninth inning -- not that anyone could tell.	Salvador Perez had three more hits, and Kansas City's bullpen barely held on for a 5-4 victory over the Cincinnati Reds on Wednesday that had everyone's blood pressure up at the end.	"It got a little elevated, I'll admit," Matheny said. "The masks -- that's one of the benefits of these things. They hide how you're feeling at this time."	The Royals were squirming when Trevor Rosenthal walked the bases loaded with one out in the ninth. Christian Colon -- whose single in the 12th inning sent the Royals over the Mets in the 2015 World Series -- grounded into a double play to end it.	The Royals have won five out of six, walking that tightrope much of the time. Kansas City has already played eight one-run games, going 3-5. Twelve of their 19 games have been decided by two runs or less.	"That inning is such a microcosm of how our last couple weeks have been going," said Rosenthal, who got his fourth save in as many chances. "We've just been fighting so hard."	The Reds wasted a chance to get back to .500 and had their only left-handed starter leave in the second inning again.	Wade Miley (0-2) signed a two-year, $15 million deal in the offseason. He retired only five batters during his Reds debut, giving up six runs in a loss to the Cubs on July 27, and went on the injured list with a strained groin afterward.	Miley appeared to hurt himself when he stepped awkwardly while covering first base in the second inning Wednesday. After talking to a trainer, Miley stayed in the game, walked the next batter and was removed after only 43 pitches.	Miley said he left because of how he was struggling with his control.	"I guess they thought I landed on the bag funny, but I was completely fine there," Miley said.	The Royals' offense has led the way during the surge. It scored one run at a time to keep it going, led by Perez's homer, double and single.	Brad Keller (2-0) allowed two singles in six shutout innings. He was acquired from Cincinnati in the 2017 Rule 5 Draft.	The bullpen had two narrow escapes.	Jesse Winker, Freddy Galvis and Josh VanMeter homered in the seventh, cutting it to 5-4. Josh Staumont escaped a two-on threat in the eighth with a pair of called third strikes, and Rosenthal provided the final drama.	"That was kind of fun, huh?" Perez said.	Perez connected for his fourth homer off Tyler Mahle, extending his hitting streak to 10 games -- his longest since 2017. He's batting .429 (18 for 42) during the streak.	LOVE THE PLACE	The Royals are 17-10 all-time vs. the Reds, including 12-4 since the start of 2009. They're 8-4 at Great American Ball Park, the best mark by a team with at least 10 games.	ONE MORE	Matheny's next win will be his 600th as a manager. He'll join Dusty Baker, Terry Francona, Joe Maddon, Bob Melvin, Ron Gardenhire, Joe Girardi, Bud Black and Don Mattingly as active managers with 600.	UMP HURT	The game was delayed 17 minutes in the bottom of the first inning when plate umpire Chris Conroy took a foul off his right hand, breaking the ring finger. Crew chief Jeff Nelson moved behind the plate for the next two innings, and Conroy returned and worked third base with his finger bandaged.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals: Adalberto Mondesi was hit in the right arm by a pitch in the fourth but stayed in the game.	Reds: Miley was reinstated from the 10-day injured list pregame and right-hander Joel Kuhnel was optioned.	UP NEXT	Royals: After a day off, KC opens a series in Minneapolis. Jakob Junis (0-0) faces the Twins for the second time in a week. He allowed two solo homers in 4 2/3 innings last Friday. Junis is trying for his first win in five starts.	Reds: Anthony DeSclafani (1-0) opens a four-game series against the Pirates. He's 0-4 in his last six starts against Pittsburgh, with the Reds losing all six games.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

NEW YORK --  Injury fill-in Clint Frazier had three hits, including a home run, and scored twice in his season debut as the Yankees beat Atlanta 6-3 Wednesday night, sweeping a two-game set.	Johan Camargo lined a two-run homer in the second to give the Braves an early lead against New York starter Masahiro Tanaka, charged with two runs on five hits and two walks in four innings.	The Yankees tied it in the bottom of the frame, clubbing back-to-back homers for the first time this season. Hitting .093 with just two extra-base hits coming in, Gary Sanchez connected for a leadoff shot to left. Starting in right field for hobbled slugger Aaron Judge, Frazier followed with a 103.1 mph blast into the Atlanta bullpen.	"Tonight was fun. It felt good to get the first at-bat out of the way and just be able to breathe," Frazier said. "I feel like I'm a little more advanced in some areas and I'm just glad tonight was able to start with a bang."	Starter Huascar Ynoa was lifted a few batters later, kicking off a cavalcade of six Atlanta relievers in seven innings.	Aaron Hicks' run-scoring double in the fourth chased Tyler Matzek (2-1) and gave New York its first lead. Gleyber Torres skied a Josh Tomlin offering to right for a single, scoring Hicks.	DJ LeMahieu and Luke Voit added RBI singles off Tomlin an inning later to wrap up the scoring. LeMahieu (4 for 5) raised his batting average to an American League-leading .431.	"I definitely have the same type of confidence, for sure, and the results are following as well," LeMahieu said, when asked if he felt similar to when he captured the 2016 National League batting title with Colorado.	Jonathan Loaisiga (2-0) hurled a pair of scoreless innings for the win, striking out three.	The Braves threatened in the seventh when the first two batters reached against Loaisiga. Chad Green came on to retire the dangerous trio of Travis d'Arnaud, Freddie Freeman and Marcell Ozuna in order.	D'Arnaud singled in a run against Jonathan Holder in the ninth. Zack Britton then walked Freeman to bring the tying run to the plate before retiring Ozuna and Adam Duvall, earning his seventh save in seven chances.	PUT ME IN, COACH	Frazier finished a triple short of the cycle, adding a single and double in his second and third at-bats.	"You throw three out there and single, double, homer. That's a pretty good return and I'm not surprised," manager Aaron Boone said. "Excited to see him come up and really have an impact."	Once a top prospect, the sometimes enigmatic 25-year-old has struggled to find playing time since being acquired in a July 2016 trade. He was recalled Tuesday when Giancarlo Stanton landed on the injured list with a strained hamstring.	"Tonight was my first real game of 2020. It's been a lot of sim games and it felt good to get instant results," Frazier said. "I'm just thrilled that I got to play tonight."	HOME COOKING	The Yankees are 23-0-3 in their last 26 series at home. According to STATS, it is the longest undefeated streak in franchise history, eclipsing their previous best achieved in 1997-98 and 1937.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Braves: OF Ronald Acuna Jr (sore left wrist) sat for the second straight night. The 2018 NL Rookie of the Year was a late scratch prior to Tuesday's series opener and was evaluated further Wednesday, revealing inflammation in his wrist. The 22-year-old will miss the weekend series in Miami and will be reevaluated on Monday. There are no plans to place him on the IL at this time. "They did all the tests and everything, and it's just irritated so hopefully they can get it calmed down in four days," manager Brian Snitker said following the game.	Yankees: Judge (lower body tightness) did not play, a night after the oft-injured slugger was lifted for a pinch-hitter. "It's kind of all over the lower body, just where he's kind of dealing with some rigors," Boone said Wednesday afternoon. "So, you know, the hips down into the hamstring and calves." It was uncertain whether Judge would return for the start of a weekend series against Boston. . LHP Aroldis Chapman (COVID-19) is scheduled to throw a second sim game Friday. He spoke to reporters via Zoom Wednesday and intimated that he could join the big league club shortly if all goes well. Pitching coach Matt Blake said that Chapman is close to being ready, but mentioned the importance of not rushing the All-Star closer.	UP NEXT	Braves: Following an off day, RHP Kyle Wright (0-2, 6.75 ERA) will open the three-game series in Miami on Friday night. The Marlins counter with RHP Pablo Lopez (1-1, 1.80 ERA).	Yankees: RHP Gerrit Cole (3-0, 3.22 ERA) should get his first taste of baseball's longest-running rivalry. New York's ace is on turn to face the Red Sox Friday in the first of four in New York.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

PHILADELPHIA --  Anthony Santander  pinged a homer off the foul pole. Rio Ruiz f our-bounced a shovel pass to nip a runner and preserve a lead.	By the thinnest of margins, the 108-loss Orioles from a year ago are turning into winners.	Santander, Ruiz and Chance Sisco all homered to lead the Baltimore Orioles to a 5-4 win over the Philadelphia Phillies on Wednesday night.	"All of us have something to prove. That makes it fun, makes us competitive," Sisco said. "That's why you see us out there having really good games."	Baltimore reliever Miguel Castro wiggled out a jam in the eighth thanks to a fantastic diving stop by Ruiz at third. Castro put runners on the corners with no outs but allowed only one run on Andrew Knapp's RBI single that cut it to 5-4. With runners on the corners, former NL MVP Andrew McCutchen (batting just .189) hit a grounder that Ruiz snagged on a diving stop and his bouncing shovel pass to second ended the rally.	"It was a big part of us winning this game," Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said.	Cole Sulser worked a scoreless ninth for his fourth save.	The Orioles took the first two games of the series and have won four straight completed games -- they are also winning a game that was suspended Sunday against Washington.	The Orioles ran through six pitchers and reliever Shawn Armstrong (2-0) got the win with 1 2/3 scoreless innings. Austin Hays led off the 10th inning with a two-run, inside-the-park homer to win Tuesday's series opener 10-9.	Baltimore went deep the usual way on Wednesday -- including Santander's tying solo shot that skimmed the foul pole against starter Zach Eflin (0-1) in the third.	Sisco gave the Phillies a 3-2 lead in the fourth with a two-RBI double, part of a three-RBI night for the catcher, and Ruiz had a solo shot in the fifth.	Eflin struck out a career-high 10 and walked only one in six innings, continuing a recent trend of solid starts from the rotation. The Phillies have dropped four of five games.	"We're all in good spirits," Eflin said. "We know what the season has done to us so far. It's tough to get into a routine with the things we've been through in the most routine-oriented sport."	Philadelphia's bullpen -- by ERA, the worst in the league -- continued to struggle. Adam Morgan gave up Sisco's solo shot on just his second pitch of the seventh inning that helped send the Orioles on their way to an impressive 6-1 road record.	"You're starting to see a plan and the confidence that comes with knowing that you can compete at this level.," Orioles starter Wade LeBlanc said. "That's always exciting to see in young guys and guys that are coming up and trying to establish themselves. The guys are doing a hell of a job doing it."	DOUBLE DUTY	Phillies 1B Rhys Hoskins tied a team record by hitting into three double plays. He struck out leading off the ninth against Sulser.	"There's no plans of moving him right now," Phillies manager Joe Girardi said.	CALL OF DUTY	Phillies RHP Connor Brogdon joined the club to provide some needed depth to a beat-up bullpen. Brogdon was waiting to report to Allentown, Pennsylvania this week when he got the call from the Phillies farm director he was headed to Philadelphia.	One issue, the 25-year-old Brogdon was playing a video game.	"I was actually right in the middle of a game of Counter-Strike," Brogdon said on Wednesday, "so I had to kind of flip one earphone off in the phone the best I could and listen."	Brogdon couldn't quit Counter-Strike while he took the call because he would have been banned from continuing the game.	"If you were to try and pause or leave the game, you would get banned for the game. You can't play for 30 minutes," he said. "I had to finish it out the best I could. ... I'm pretty sure my teammate was pretty mad at me."	Brogdon went 6-2 with a 2.61 ERA last season combined in the minor leagues.	He joined a bullpen that entered Wednesday's game with a 10.19 ERA.	"You want to step up and be the one that turns things around," Morgan said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: SS Jose' Iglesias (sore left quad) started for the first time since Saturday, but he's not through dealing with the lingering injury. "We're going to manage it the best way we can over the next month and a half," manager Brandon Hyde said. "It's going to be a daily conversation between me and him on how he's feeling."	UP NEXT	Orioles: Tom Eshelman (0-0, 3.68 ERA) makes his second start of the season Thursday in the series finale. The right-hander toiled in the minors for Philadelphia for 3  1/2 years before being traded to Baltimore in June 2019. Former Oriole Jake Arrieta (1-1, 2.45) will start for the Phillies.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

MILWAUKEE --  Byron Buxton hit two solo home runs and Miguel Sano added another as the Minnesota Twins jumped to an early lead and routed the Milwaukee Brewers 12-2 on Wednesday night.	The victory gave the AL Central-leading Twins a 2-1 series win over the Brewers, who dropped to 2-6 at home.	Minnesota starter Kenta Maeda (3-0), in his first season with the Twins after being acquired from the Dodgers in February, retired the first 11 batters he faced. He allowed two runs in 6 2 / 3 innings, striking out five and walking one. He entered the game with 16 strikeouts and three walks in 17 innings.	Brewers left-hander Eric Lauer (0-2), acquired from the Padres in November, had lasted only three innings and given up six runs in his first start. On Wednesday, he surrendered seven runs in 3 2/3 innings.	"It felt like there was a lot more just kind of bad baseball luck happening there," Lauer said. "I was making some competitive pitches, wasn't getting a whole lot of calls, just wasn't attacking as much as I should have been."	The Twins set the tone in the second inning, jumping to a 5-0 lead on a ball that was hit into the sun, four consecutive singles and a wild pitch.	Jake Cave drove in the first run with a line-drive double that froze left fielder Christian Yelich for several seconds as he used his glove to shield his eyes from the sun. Mitch Garver scored on Nelson Cruz's broken-bat single into center field.	"Those are the kinds of innings that you want to stay in the dugout, you want to keep hitting," Garver said.	The Twins led 12-0 before Milwaukee pushed across its two runs in the sixth inning on a single by Luis Urias.	The 12 runs is the most given up by Brewers pitchers this season. Of the Twins' nine starting batters, only Garver did not have an RBI.	"You look at the lineup from top to bottom, it was an explosive night and unrelenting, and that's what we're looking for," said Twins manager Rocco Baldelli.	Milwaukee third baseman Jedd Gyorko made his third career appearance on the mound, pitching a scoreless ninth inning.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Twins: Baldelli expects right-hander Zack Littell (left hamstring strain) to be activated by the time the team returns home Friday.	Brewers: With one out in the fifth inning and a 2-1 count on Marwin Gonzalez, right-hander Justin Grimm was removed. He had a callous on his index finger "that basically came open," manager Craig Counsell said.	HOT PITCHING	Entering Wednesday, Twins right-hander Randy Dobnak (3-1) led the majors with an ERA of 0.90.	In four outings, Brewers left-hander Josh Hader has three saves and has yet to allow a run or a hit. Opposing batters are 0-for-12.	UP NEXT	Twins: Thursday is their second off-day this season. On Friday, they host the Royals in the first of 20 straight games.	Brewers: In Chicago facing Cubs RHP Yu Darvish (2-1, 2.12 ERA), who has thrown 16 strikeouts in 17 innings. LHP Brett Anderson (0-1. 5.40 ERA) goes for Milwaukee.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.

BOSTON --  Blake Snell pitched five shutout innings and the Tampa Bay Rays backed him with a trio of 400-foot homers to beat the Boston Red Sox 9-5 on Wednesday night and earn their fifth straight victory.	Willy Adames, Brandon Lowe and Yoshi Tsutsugo all homered off Zack Godley, and Austin Meadows hit a solo shot in the ninth after Boston scored five in the eighth to cut into an eight-run lead.	Lowe had a single, homer and double in his first three at-bats but failed in his next two plate appearances to complete the cycle. He is hitting over .400 in his career at Fenway Park.	"He didn't want to be great today. Didn't want the triple," said an obviously amped up Snell, who began his postgame Zoom call by speed-greeting many of the pictured reporters by name. "Three knocks today, that's exciting stuff."	J.D. Martinez hit a grand slam to make it 8-5 as Boston's first six batters in the eighth hit safely off Aaron Slegers. But Nick Anderson came on and struck out the next two batters and then, after Alex Verdugo singled, got Jackie Bradley Jr. on a groundout to end the inning.	The Red Sox have lost three in a row and eight of their last 11, with one more against the Rays before heading into a four-game series at Yankee Stadium.	Kevin Pillar had four hits for Boston, but he also got thrown out trying to take second on a ball off the Green Monster and the Red Sox trailing 6-0.	Snell (1-0) allowed four hits and walked no one, striking out six to earn his first win of the season. The 2018 AL Cy Young winner, who struggled with injuries last year and hadn't lasted more than three innings yet this season, threw a season-high 70 pitches and left with an 8-0 lead.	"Looking forward to being a starting pitcher again and getting away from the opener role," Snell said. "I felt like Blake Snell. I finally feel healthy."	Manager Kevin Cash called it "another step in the right direction."	"Blake's got to feel good with this one," he said.	Godley (0-2) hadn't allowed a run in eight innings over two previous Fenway appearances. He was charged with eight runs on 10 hits and two walks, striking out three in three innings.	"The last outing threw up a bunch of zeroes," Red Sox manager Ron Roenicke said. "It's just hard to say what's going to happen from game to game."	IN THE WEB	Godley had some bad luck mixed in with a few pitches that he can't blame on anyone but himself.	Tampa Bay's first run scored when first baseman Michael Chavis cleanly fielded a bases-loaded grounder but the ball got stuck in the webbing of his glove, preventing him from doing anything but stepping on first. In the second, after Adames had already hit a 400-foot home run, Pillar lost a fly ball that would have been the third out in the twilight, and Brandon Lowe hit the next pitch 415 feet for a two-run homer.	Tsutsugo made it 6-0 with a 405-foot homer in the third, and then the Rays took an 8-0 lead in the fourth.	"When things aren't going well, you see some weird stuff happening," Roenicke said. "Things aren't going well, that's all there is to it. We're not getting breaks and weird things are happening."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: Placed OF Andrew Benintendi on the injured list with a strained rib cage. He was injured when he fell down trying to go from first to third on a single in Tuesday night's game.	UP NEXT	Rays: RHP Tyler Glasnow (0-1) starts for Tampa Bay as it tries to sweep the four-game series.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Derek Dietrich talked a few hours before his Texas Rangers debut about just wanting to make some kind of impact for his new team.	The veteran infielder certainly did in a big comeback against the Seattle Mariners.	Dietrich reached base all four times, had a big stolen base and scored twice for the Rangers, who overcame an early four-run deficit for a 7-4 win Wednesday night, wrapping up a homestand when they won five of six games.	"That eighth inning, that was fun. I was pumped up," Dietrich said. "It felt good to feel that again. It's been a little bit."	A one-out single by Dietrich off hard-throwing Erik Swanson (0-1) got Texas' five-run eighth going before Elvis Andrus, mired in a 2-for-23 slump, doubled into the left field corner and pinch-hitter Todd Frazier was hit by a pitch to load the bases. Dietrich scored when No. 9 batter Jeff Mathis had a bloop single before Shin-Soo Choo's game-tying sacrifice fly. Frazier scored the go-ahead run on a wild pitch by Taylor Williams, who had just entered. Willie Calhoun, already with an RBI hit an inning earlier, added a two-run single.	Dietrich had three hits and was hit by a pitch, becoming the first player since rookie Joey Gallo in June 2015 to reach base safely four times in his Texas debut.	"You see the energy he brought," manager Chris Woodward said. "He's got a ton of energy. A great game for him to start off."	Jonathan Hernandez (3-0), the fourth Texas pitcher, pitched a scoreless eighth before Rafael Montero's perfect ninth for his fourth save in as many chances.	Seattle scored all of its runs in the second off Jordan Lyles. Austin Nola led off by lining a 424-foot homer into Seattle's bullpen in left-center before Shed Long Jr. walked. Daniel Vogelbach then made it 3-0 when he pulled a 442-foot shot into the right field seats -- well beyond the five rows of cardboard cutouts of fans. Kyle Lewis later added a sacrifice fly.	After getting his release from the Chicago Cubs last weekend, and 721 big league games the past seven seasons for Miami and Cincinnati, Dietrich joined the Rangers and initially signed a minor league deal so he could work out. He got added to the roster Tuesday, a day before starting in place of struggling second baseman Rougned Odor, hitting .116 this season with only two hits and 13 strikeouts his last 29 at-bats.	Dietrich was hit by a pitch with two outs in the sixth and stole second base before scoring on J.P. Crawford's throwing error when Andrus hit a grounder. Seattle's shortstop then made a spectacular inning-ending play, diving up the middle on another chopper and while still on the ground scooped the ball from his glove to second baseman Long for the forceout.	Asked about his plans for Dietrich when Texas plays again, Woodward responded, "I'll get him in there somewhere, whether that's at first or second. I know he can play third as well. I'll figure out some way to get him in there."	SHORT HOPS	The Rangers have gone four games without a home run for the first time since September 2015. It's been 157 plate appearances since Gallo homered on Saturday. ... Seattle made its only trip this season to the Rangers new ballpark.	DIFFERENT TAKES	What Woodward called a "huge victory for so many reasons" was what Mariners manager Scott Servais termed a "tough one to let get away. I thought Taijuan Walker was awesome. ... Obviously we didn't have enough to hold on right at the end, but these games are so important for us. We're putting guys in situations they've never experienced before."	FOR STARTERS	Taijuan Walker allowed only an unearned run and scattered six hits over six innings, with five strikeouts and one walk. It was the fourth start in his return to Seattle, which traded the right-hander to Arizona after the 2016 season, after making only four starts combined the past two seasons for the Diamondbacks because of his Tommy John surgery in April 2018. ... Lyles allowed 11 base runners in his five innings -- six hits, four walks and a hit batter.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: RHP Jimmy Herget was recalled from the alternate training site when RHP Nick Goody (back spasms) was put on the 10-day injured list. ... C Robinson Chirinos was out of the lineup for the second game in a row, and before a scheduled off day Thursday, because of left ankle soreness.	UP NEXT	Mariners: After being the only American League team to play 20 games in 20 days to start the season, Seattle has a day off Thursday before opening a three-game series Friday in Houston.	Rangers: Open a three-game series Friday at Colorado, which won 2 of 3 at Texas to start the season.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

LOS ANGELES --  Tony Gonsolin and five relievers combined on a six-hit shutout, Justin Turner hit a three-run homer, and the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the San Diego Padres 6-0 on Wednesday night to avoid losing three in a row for the first time since last August.	The Dodgers played small ball to score two runs in the fifth, then Turner slugged his second three-run blast of the season in the eighth off Craig Stammen.	"I love the homers as much as everybody, but to manufacture is as fun as anything," manager Dave Roberts said.	Gonsolin was recalled before the game to make his second start of the season. He gave up three hits over 4 2/3 innings, struck out a career-high eight and walked one.	Blake Treinen (1-1) got the win, striking out three in 1 1/3 innings.	San Diego's Fernando Tatis Jr. was hitless in four at-bats, including a strikeout that snapped his nine-game hitting streak.	The Padres loaded the bases in the ninth when Scott Alexander couldn't get anyone out. Tommy Pham reached on an infield single to third, pinch-hitter Ty France walked and Wil Myers singled to load the bases.	Kenley Jansen came in and retired the next three batters, including two on strikeouts, to close out the Dodgers' second shutout of the shortened season.	The Padres saw their season-high three-game winning streak end. They had at least one homer in each of their five previous games against the Dodgers this season.	San Diego had the potential tying run at the plate in the eighth and Brusdar Graterol stuck out Manny Machado to end the inning. The Padres had the same situation in the seventh, but Eric Hosmer grounded out to second for the third out.	Zach Davies (2-2) took the loss, allowing two runs and four hits in seven innings. He struck out five and walked two.	"First and foremost was getting deep into the ballgame, being able to get through six, seven innings and give the bullpen a rest," Davies said. "Unfortunately, we couldn't pull the `W' out, but we've got Game 4 tomorrow."	Cody Bellinger, who was hitting .167 coming in, hit a ground-rule double in the eighth for just his seventh RBI of the season. Earlier, he grounded into an inning-ending double play for the third time in two games. Turner followed with his shot to right field that made it 6-0.	Edwin Rios singled in a run and Austin Barnes' fielder's choice safety squeeze bunt to first base led to another that gave the Dodgers a 2-0 lead in the fifth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: C Will Smith left the game in the fifth with a sore neck, the aftermath of a collision in San Diego last week. Barnes will catch Thursday's series finale. ... SS Corey Seager missed his fifth straight game because of lower back discomfort. He took batting practice, hit in the cage and took grounders. There's no timeline for his return, but when Seager comes back he'll be in the DH role for the first day or two. He's batting .340.	GONSOLIN AND COVID-19	Gonsolin said he was late arriving to summer camp because of what he believes what a false positive on a COVID-19 test.	"I tested positive and then not again," he said, adding that if he'd been able to arrive on time he might have made the roster. Instead, he's shuttled between Dodger Stadium and the team's alternate training site a few miles away at the University of Southern California.	Gonsolin may be able to stay with the big-league club after his latest outing.	"Tony has done everything he needed to do to earn another start," Roberts said.	UP NEXT	Padres: RHP Chris Paddack (2-1, 3.18 ERA) makes his fifth career start against the Dodgers. His lone victory came Aug. 3, when he tossed six innings of three-run ball. Dodgers: LHP Julio Urias (1-0, 2.40) starts the series finale after getting an extra day of rest. He hasn't faced the Padres since 2016, when he was 0-0 with a 2.16 ERA. He turned 24 on Wednesday.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

NEW YORK --  Tomas Nido had his first two-homer game as a professional, hitting a two-run shot in the fourth inning and a grand slam in the fifth to lead the New York Mets to an 8-2 win over the Washington Nationals and a split of the four-game series.	Nido, who entered Thursday with five homers and 26 RBI over 93 games in parts of four big league seasons, is just the fifth catcher in Mets history to hit at least two homers and collect at least six RBI in a game. Hall of Famers Gary Carter and Mike Piazza did it twice apiece and Todd Hundley and Paul Lo Duca once each.	Nido struck out in the seventh as he tried to match Carter, the only Mets catcher with a three-homer game.	"Hard work pays off," Nido said. "I did work really hard this offseason and it just feels good to be able to help the team win."	Dominic Smith homered in the second and Pete Alonso had an RBI single in the eighth for the Mets, who were relieved to learn their second straight victory wasn't as costly it first appeared it could have been.	Left fielder Jeff McNeil was carted off after crashing into the wall while robbing Asdrubal Cabrera of a two-run extra-base hit to end the first inning. Manager Luis Rojas said afterward that X-rays and an MRI on McNeil's left knee were negative and that the All-Star is day-to-day with a bone bruise.	"When I got out there with the trainer, we were a little concerned just how he was talking to us," Rojas said of McNeil, who covered his eyes with his hands after he fell and flung his glove.	McNeil's catch cost the Nationals the chance to put up a crooked number against rookie David Peterson (3-1), who allowed Washington to load the bases with no outs. Trea Turner walked and went to third when Nido fielded Adam Eaton's bunt and threw the ball into center field. Starlin Castro walked before Peterson struck out hot-hitting Juan Soto and retired Howie Kendrick on a run-scoring comebacker to bring up Cabrera.	Peterson allowed only the unearned run over five innings and gave up just one hit -- Yan Gomes' single leading off the fifth. The rookie southpaw walked two, struck out three and retired 11 of 12 before Gomes' hit. Peterson was lifted after 74 pitches due to some routine shoulder soreness, but said he wasn't concerned.	Jared Hughes, Edwin Diaz and Brad Brach combined to finish the five-hitter.	Soto capped a sensational series by homering in the sixth. He was 7 for 15 with four homers and eight RBI in the four-game set.	Austin Voth (0-2) took the loss after allowing three runs while throwing 86 pitches over four innings. He has thrown five innings or fewer in all three starts this season.	"Eighty-seven pitches in four innings -- that's a lot," Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. "We've got to get him through five or six innings."	ON-BASE MACHINES	Mets leadoff batter Brandon Nimmo doubled in the first inning to extend his on-base streak to a career-high 34 games. It's tied for the third-longest streak in team history with Alonso (2019) and Carlos Delgado (2007-08). ... Michael Conforto walked in the third and has reached base in a career-high 21 straight games dating to the 2019 season finale.	HELLO, I MUST BE GOING	Nationals RHP Stephen Strasburg, scheduled to start Friday despite still dealing with a nerve issue in his right hand, was ejected from the stands for arguing balls and strikes in the third inning.	Strasburg, sitting in Section 121 at Citi Field in this socially distant season, was apparently unhappy with the strike zone of home plate umpire Carlos Torres after Voth's 2-2 pitch to Alonso on the outside corner was ruled a ball.	Moments later, Torres ejected Strasburg, though it took a few seconds to realize who had been tossed. Someone was heard yelling, "You're (expletive) brutal" shortly before television cameras captured Strasburg doffing his cap as he walked up the staircase on his way out of the park.	"I thought the umpire threw me out of the game, so I was kind of heated up," Martinez said. "(Strasburg) got thrown out as a fan. I love Stephen. I can't tell you what he said, but I love him."	The usually stoic Strasburg appeared to be grinning underneath his blue mask as he made his exit.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: SS Amed Rosario (stomach) missed his third straight game. ... 2B Robinson Cano (left groin) played another simulated game Wednesday, but couldn't work out on the field before Thursday's game because the tarp was on in anticipation of morning rains. The Mets are hopeful he can return when eligible Friday.	Nationals: In a flurry of pregame moves involving relievers, Washington put LHPs Sean Doolittle (right knee fatigue) and Sam Freeman (left flexor mass strain) on the 10-day injured list, reinstated RHP Will Harris (groin) from the IL and selected the contract of LHP Seth Romero, their first-round pick in the 2017 draft who missed all of last year after having Tommy John reconstructive elbow surgery in August 2018. Romero made his big league debut Thursday and gave up four runs in 1 2/3 innings. Freeman, injured while pitching Wednesday night, and Doolittle, 0-1 with a 15.00 ERA in five appearances this year, were the only two lefties in Washington's bullpen. ... CF Victor Robles was out of the starting lineup, a day after getting hit by a pitch on a knuckle on his right hand. "Just being very cautious," Martinez said. Michael A. Taylor started in Robles' spot. ... LHP Roenis Elias has been shut down after feeling his forearm tighten, Martinez said. Elias is on the 60-day IL because of a left elbow flexor strain.	UP NEXT	Mets: Jacob deGrom (2-0, 2.45 ERA) will look to win his third straight start when the Mets begin a road trip at Philadelphia.	Nationals: Strasburg (0-0, 10.38 ERA) is scheduled to start as the first road trip of the season continues in Baltimore with an unusual setup Friday. First, the clubs will complete a game suspended because the grounds crew couldn't unfurl the tarp properly when it rained in the top of the sixth inning Sunday with the Orioles leading 5-2 at Washington -- so the Nationals will be the "home" team for the resumption Friday -- and then they'll play the day's originally scheduled game.	-	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

PHILADELPHIA --  These aren't the 100-loss Baltimore Orioles anymore.	Pedro Severino and Rio Ruiz hit homers to back Thomas Eshelman and the Baltimore Orioles beat the Philadelphia Phillies 11-4 Thursday to complete a three-game sweep.	Eshelman (1-0) allowed two runs and four hits in five innings to earn his second career win.	The Orioles, who lost 108 games last season and 115 in 2018, are off to a 10-7 start.	"I've seen it from the get-go," Jose Iglesias said. "Regardless of whether we're winning or losing, I see potential. I see very hungry players with a lot of talent. They want to be better. I see chemistry. I've been around and I see a good group that wants to compete and they get along. And for me that has a lot of value."	Eshelman was Philadelphia's minor league pitcher of the year in 2017 but the right-hander was traded to Baltimore last year for international slot money.	"I'm just trying to do my role, just trying to give the team a chance to win no matter what role," he said. "I've been trying to pitch for the team, not for myself. That's my motto. It's a great team to pitch for."	Phillies starter Jake Arrieta (1-2) gave up four runs and seven hits in 4 2/3 innings.	"No reason I shouldn't have been able to go at least seven innings," Arrieta said.	J.T. Realmuto hit a pair of two-run homers for the Phillies, who fell to 5-9 under first-year manager Joe Girardi. Realmuto has seven homers and 17 RBI.	Arrieta cruised into the fifth before things unraveled. The Orioles loaded the bases on three singles. Pat Valaika grounded into a fielder's choice as second baseman Jean Segura made a diving stop to prevent a hit and record the second out. Then Anthony Santander lined a three-run double to right to give the Orioles a 4-2 lead.	Iglesias drove a two-run double to left-center to make it 6-2 in the seventh.	Severino hit Connor Brogdon's first major league pitch into the seats in left for a 9-2 lead in the eighth. Ruiz connected off Brogdon in the ninth.	"You look at the box score here, our pitching, no walks," Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. "That was just something that we didn't do well last year. Way too many free passes, pitched behind in the count. Quite a few games now where we haven't walked many people. And that is super key against good offensive clubs."	The start of the game was delayed 99 minutes because of rain.	Realmuto followed Bryce Harper's double with an opposite-field shot to right-center in the fourth, giving the Phillies a 2-0 lead. The "Sign J.T." chants from the group of fans who gather outside the ballpark grow louder each game. Realmuto can become a free agent after the season.	Realmuto followed Harper's triple with his seventh homer in the eighth.	Infielder Neil Walker got the final two outs for the Phillies and instantly became Philadelphia's most successful reliever. The bullpen has a 10.12 ERA.	"It happens, it's frustrating," Girardi said. "You gotta fight. It's not gonna get any easier."	WELCOME TO THE BIGS	Third baseman Alec Bohm, the top hitting prospect for the Phillies, made his major league debut. He was greeted by air horns, vuvuzelas and cheers from the Phandemic Krew watching from the sidewalk on 10th street and Phillies Way. Bohm promptly ripped a double down the line his first time up.	SPECIAL HONOR	The Phillies will retire Dick Allen's No. 15 on Sept. 3. Allen spent nine of his 15 major league seasons with the Phillies and was National League Rookie of the Year in 1964. He batted .290 with 204 home runs, 655 RBI and had a .371 on-base percentage and .530 slugging percentage for Philadelphia. Allen will join Hall of Famers Richie Ashburn (1), Jim Bunning (14), Mike Schmidt (20), Steve Carlton (32), Roy Halladay (34) and Robin Roberts (36) as the only Phillies in team history to have their numbers retired.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: Iglesias, who is bothered by a sore left quad, played DH instead of shortstop.	Phillies: OF Adam Haseley was placed on the 10-day injury list with a left wrist sprain.	UP NEXT	Orioles: Will complete a game suspended in the sixth inning Sunday because of a tarp malfunction in Washington, and then host the Nationals in the opener of a three-game series Friday. Lefty Tommy Milone (1-1, 3.21 ERA) opens the second game. He blanked Washington over six innings last week.	Phillies: RHP Spencer Howard (0-1, 7.71) is expected to start Friday night against the New York Mets.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

BOSTON --  Hunter Renfroe hit two homers and drove in three runs, Mike Zunino belted a three-run shot over the Green Monster and out of Fenway Park and the surging Tampa Bay Rays beat the struggling Boston Red Sox 17-8 on Thursday to complete a four-game series sweep.	It was the sixth straight win for the Rays (12-8), who posted their eighth consecutive victory in Fenway. Tampa Bay won for the 12th time in its last 14 games against Boston.	Brandon Lowe added a solo homer during a five-run third inning that chased starter Kyle Hart (0-1), who was making his major-league debut.	Manuel Margot had his second four-hit game of the series, Willy Adames had three hits and two RBI, and Yoshi Tsutsugo had two hits and two RBI for the Rays, who posted season-highs in runs and hits (19). Zunino drove in four runs.	"The whole series, the guys were tremendous," Rays manager Kevin Cash said. "That's not an easy thing to do, to sweep a team like the Red Sox."	Kevin Plawecki had a two-run double and three RBI for Boston, and Rafael Devers made three throwing errors after a first-inning RBI single. The Red Sox (6-13), who own the AL's worst record, have lost four straight.	Even a "drone delay" in the third, didn't stop the Rays' offense. The game was delayed for about four minutes by a drone flying outside the park beyond the right-field bleachers.	"That's a new situation," Adames said. "I've never seen that before. You just don't know what to do."	With Tsutsugo at the plate, players on the field and the umpires pointed to where it was. The Rays' two runners on base left the field and Boston's fielders headed to their dugout area, too. The umpires walked off, waiting on the track near Boston's dugout.	"I didn't even know the rule," Cash said. "The Red Sox certainly did. They walked off the field. I heard it was a kid. I hope he didn't get in too much trouble."	When play resumed, Tsutsugo, the last batter Hart faced, lined an RBI single to right.	Hart gave up seven runs -- five earned -- in two-plus innings. Rays starter Tyler Glasnow went four innings, giving up five runs on eight hits, striking out eight and walking two.	"Mentally it was a little bit of a draining day," Hart said. "Obviously the results not even close to what I envisioned."	Jalen Beeks (1-1) pitched two scoreless innings in relief and was credited with the win. Anthony Banda pitched three innings for his first career save.	Leading 10-5, Tampa Bay broke it open with a six-run sixth, scoring all the runs off Marcus Walden, who didn't get an out. Renfroe homered over the Monster and five batters later Zunino sent his shot out of Fenway.	CRAZY MOP-UP MOVES	Infielder Jose Peraza pitched the ninth for Boston, but had to leave after getting hit on the leg by Lowe's hard grounder.	Plawecki then moved from catcher to pitcher, getting the final two outs, and Tzu-Wei Lin took over behind the plate. It was Lin's first-ever time catching professionally.	"Once Peraza got smoked in the knee, that's about as bad as it gets. We're trying to get through a game and he gets smoked," Red Sox manager Ron Roenicke said. "He's OK. We X-rayed it and he actually got hit in a good spot on the knee, but I still feel bad about it."	EIGHT IS MORE THAN ENOUGH	The Rays scored at least eight runs in every game of the series. Getting eight in the first two and nine on Wednesday.	They came into the series ranked near the bottom of the AL in total runs before the outburst.	Not bad for a team that entered the series winless on the road.	"I told you all we'd be fine two weeks ago," Renfroe said. "You were worried about the offense."	TAKE THAT	Hart struck out Renfroe swinging on a slider in the first inning for his first big-league K. In his next at-bat against the 27-year-old lefty, Renfroe sent a shot into the Red Sox bullpen.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: Brent Honeywell Jr., one of the organization's top pitching prospects threw live BP two days ago. He underwent a decompression procedure on his right ulnar nerve on May 20 and hadn't thrown to hitters since April of 2019.	Red Sox: SS Xander Bogaerts had the day off. Roenicke said: "He's got some stuff going on in his lower half, some fatigue there." He expects him back in the lineup Friday against the Yankees.	UP NEXT	Rays: TBD Friday night at the Toronto Blue Jays in their 2020 alternate home in Buffalo, New York, after the Canadian government wouldn't allow them to play in the country due to the coronavirus.	Red Sox: Roenicke said it'll be a "bullpen game" in the opener of a four-game series against the Yankees in New York on Friday.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

CINCINNATI --  Adam Frazier hit the first of three homers off Anthony DeSclafani, who hasn't beaten Pittsburgh in his last seven tries, and the Pirates returned from a three-day layoff with a flourish, beating the Cincinnati Reds 9-6 Thursday night.	Pittsburgh's three-game series in St. Louis was called off because of the Cardinals' COVID-19 outbreak. The Pirates showed no rust against a pitcher they've dominated.	"Was it the boost we needed? Sure," said Trevor Williams (1-3), who went five innings. "In combination with the three days off, it was pretty nice for us."	DeSclafani (1-1) didn't allow a run in either of his first two starts this season. Frazier connected  on the right-hander's second pitch Thursday, and the Pirates surged to a 9-0 lead after two innings.	"It seemed like they were on everything," Reds manager David Bell said. "We hated to keep him out there, but he's such a good pitcher. We don't have answers. We talked to him during the game and he didn't have answers."	DeSclafani hasn't beaten the Pirates since June 17, 2018, at PNC Park. Since then, he's 0-5 in seven starts -- all Pirates wins -- giving up 29 runs in 32 1/3 innings.	The Pirates won for only the second time in their last 12 games.	"A lot of guys, including myself, have been searching a little bit," Frazier said. "I think it was great, a mental reset."	Colin Moran also connected in the first inning for his sixth homer. Gregory Polanco led off  the second with a home run, the fourth time in his career that DeSclafani has given up three in a game, his career high.	The Pirates sent 12 batters to the plate and scored seven runs in the second inning, their biggest of the season. Josh Bell singled home  a pair of runs, and Moran had an RBI single during the rally, which included DeSclafani walking Polanco with the bases loaded.	DeSclafani gave up a career-worst nine runs in two innings. His previous high was seven runs allowed, done twice against the Mets in 2014 and 2015.	Nick Senzel had a run-scoring single and a two-run homer off Williams, who allowed three runs in five innings. Senzel added an RBI double in the eighth off Geoff Hartlieb that cut it to 9-5, and Tucker Barnhart ended an 0-for-22 slump with a leadoff homer in the ninth against Keone Kela.	Since the middle of the 2018 season, the Pirates have gone 23-9 against the Reds, including 10-6 at Great American Ball Park.	LIKES THE PLACE	Pirates first-year manager Derek Shelton has always enjoyed how the ball flies at Great American Ball Park.	"A lot of people like to hit at this ballpark," Shelton said. "I've been here as a hitting coach. I was really fond of it as a hitting coach."	SHOGO TIME	Shogo Akiyama slammed into the left-field wall  to rob Frazier of an RBI double in the fifth inning, holding on as he hit the ground after making the catch.	DEEP SLUMPS	Barnhart ended his deep slump with the homer in the ninth, but Nick Castellanos went 1 for 5, leaving him in a 4-for-30 rut.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: Kela was reinstated from the injured list and LHP Miguel Del Pozo was designated for assignment. Kela's pitch to Derek Dietrich helped spark a brawl between the teams July 31 last year.	Reds: Mike Moustakas is eligible to come off the injured list Sunday. Bell said Moustakas is recovering nicely from an injured left thigh and should be ready to play Sunday or shortly thereafter.	UP NEXT	Pirates: Chad Kuhl (0-0) is 2-1 with a 2.51 ERA in five career starts against the Reds. He's given up two runs or less in four of the five starts.

CHICAGO --  Yu Darvish knew his pitch count was climbing, but he wasn't exactly showing signs of fatigue, either.	Darvish took a no-hitter into the seventh inning in his third straight dominant start, and the major league-leading Chicago Cubs defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 4-2 on Thursday night.	Darvish (3-1) allowed just one hit -- Justin Smoak's towering solo homer to right field with one out in the seventh inning on his 98th pitch -- before Casey Sadler relieved to start the eighth. The 33-year-old right-hander from Japan struck out 11 and threw 104 pitches.	He's twice come within one out of a no-hitter, both times with the Texas Rangers. Those near-misses weren't on his mind against the Brewers.	"I know I'm not going to get another inning because of the pitch count," Darvish said. "I just tried to keep the game close."	Before Smoak's drive, Darvish allowed only three baserunners. He walked Ben Gamel in the second and Orlando Arcia in the fifth, and hit Christian Yelich with a low pitch in the first.	"He came out looking sharp, strike one right away," Cubs manager David Ross said. "For the most part he was sound in his mechanics. He didn't have to labor at all through the game."	Darvish notched his final two strikeouts, both swinging, around Smoak's homer.	"We've obviously been struggling offensively but I thought this was a good pitching performance," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. "It was 97 (mph), breaking ball at 80 mph, cutters. He pitched really well tonight."	"It didn't feel like we had a lot of pitches to hit."	Kyle Schwarber hit a solo homer in the second as Chicago improved to 13-3 for the first time since 1907. Javier Baez, Ian Happ and David Bote each had an RBI.	"You look at the depth of our team and it's just unbelievable," Schwarber said. "Professional at-bat after professional at-bat.	"You couldn't ask for a better group of men to be in a room with, especially going through a pandemic here and trying to complete a season."	Darvish signed a $126 million, six-year contract with the Cubs as a free agent in February 2018, but has been hampered by elbow and triceps injuries since coming to Chicago. But after a rocky first outing this season, against the Brewers on July 25, Darvish has been in a groove.	He's trimmed his ERA to 1.88 and has fanned 27 in 24 innings.	Sadler worked around a single by Arcia in a scoreless eighth. Rowan Wick allowed a single by Avisail Garcia and a ground-rule double to Smoak with two outs in the ninth for Milwaukee's second run, but closed it out for his third save and a combined four-hitter.	Cubs slugger Kris Bryant was held out of the starting lineup with a sore left wrist and ring finger.	Ross didn't disclose if Bryant would be available off the bench, but said he made the move out of "an abundance of caution."	Bryant was injured trying to make a diving catch in left field Wednesday in the fifth inning of the Cubs' 7-2 win at Cleveland. He remained in the game and hit a home run in the sixth before being pulled in the eighth	With Bryant out, Schwarber started in left field and Bote at third base.	The Cubs jumped ahead 1-0 in the first. Nico Hoerner laced Brett Anderson's first pitch for a double and scored on Baez's groundout.	Schwarber led off the second with an opposite-field shot to left to make it 2-0.	Chicago tacked on two more runs in the sixth off reliever Corbin Burnes. Happ drove in the first with a double and Bote followed with an RBI single.	Darvish's pitch count was piling up entering the seventh. There was no doubt on Smoak's drive, which sailed out to right. Before that, the hardest-hit ball off Darvish was Yelich's liner straight at right fielder Steven Souza Jr. leading off the fourth.	Anderson (0-2) allowed two runs in 4 1/3 innings.	BREWERS MOVES	The Brewers optioned LHP Eric Lauer to their alternate training site in Appleton, Wisconsin. Lauer dropped to 0-2 and his ERA ballooned to 12.54 after Minnesota pounded him for seven runs on nine hits over 3 2/3 innings in a start at Milwaukee on Wednesday. Counsell wasn't ready to name Lauer's replacement in the rotation, but the Brewers recalled LHP Angel Perdomo and selected RHP Drew Rasmussen from the alternate site.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: Placed RHP Justin Grimm on the 10-day injured list with a callus laceration on his right index finger after it flared up in a 12-2 loss to the Twins on Wednesday.	Cubs: Ross said he was just "trying to be extra cautious" with Bryant. "I don't think there's a great deal of concern," Ross said. "We just want to make sure he's good to go." . Schwarber returned after being scratched on Wednesday with a bruised right knee.	UP NEXT	Brewers: RHP Brandon Woodruff (1-1, 2.53 ERA) faces Cubs RHP Tyler Chatwood (2-1, 5.40) on Friday night. Woodruff's loss was on opening day at Wrigley Field. Chatwood was sharp in his first two starts before being roughed up for eight runs in 2 1/3 innings at Kansas City last week.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.
