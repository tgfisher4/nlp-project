DETROIT --  Amid all the talk about Kansas City's promising farm system and bright future, the current Royals are quietly off to a nice start.	Wilson Betemit went 4 for 4 with two doubles, and the Royals beat the mistake-prone Detroit Tigers 9-5 on Sunday. Luke Hochevar pitched seven solid innings for Kansas City, and every Royals starter had a hit.	Kansas City took two of three from the Tigers and improved to 6-3. Not bad, considering many of the team's top prospects might be at least a year from making an impact.	"We feel great," said Jeff Francoeur, who hit a single and a triple. "We're here, and it's our turn to go out there and show what we can do. I think you watch -- every guy is just doing the best they can, and hopefully it's good enough. Right now it is."	Miguel Cabrera, Jhonny Peralta and Alex Avila all homered for Detroit, but the Tigers made four errors.	Hochevar (1-1) gave up the three homers, but Detroit managed only two other hits off him. He easily outdueled Rick Porcello (0-2) in a matchup of former first-round draft picks. Three relievers finished for the Royals, with Joakim Soria getting the final two outs for his third save.	It was the first four-hit game for Betemit since July 14, 2007. He also drew a walk.	"That was a great day -- not only for me. The team played really hard," Betemit said. "We're starting good right now. We have to keep going."	If the Royals keep this up, their fans might have more to look forward to this summer than just checking out reports from the team's minor league system -- which is considered one of baseball's best.	"I know this team has great prospects in the minor leagues," Betemit said. "When you see those guys in the minor leagues -- all those young guys, you've seen in spring training, those are great players. You're going to see those guys soon."	Hochevar was the Royals' Opening Day starter after the team traded ace Zack Greinke. He was sharp against the Tigers, striking out six without a walk. He allowed four runs, three earned.	Porcello, on the other hand, was in trouble from the start. He made a wild pickoff throw in the first inning, putting a man on third with one out. He managed to pitch out of that jam, but Kansas City broke through in the third.	After a walk to Chris Getz, Melky Cabrera slapped a double down the left-field line, and Ryan Raburn's throw in to second sailed high for an error, allowing Getz to score and Cabrera to take third. Alex Gordon drove in Cabrera with a groundout.	Peralta homered in the bottom half, but Kansas City answered with a run in the fourth. The Royals then scored two in the fifth, again with help from the sloppy Tigers. After a run-scoring triple by Francoeur and a walk by Betemit, Matt Treanor hit a potential double-play grounder to third base that could have ended the inning. Instead, Brandon Inge threw wide of second for another error, and a run came home.	Porcello allowed five runs on nine hits in five innings. He struck out two and walked three.	"As the game went on, I didn't do a good job of mixing my pitches. I got into a pattern, and they got all over that and started waiting on my sinker," Porcello said. "The pickoff was a bad throw, but that wasn't my issue today."	Avila hit a solo homer in the sixth. Umpires reviewed the play because a fan reached over a railing to catch the ball in right field, but it appeared the ball was above the wall.	Betemit drove in a run in the seventh with a double when right fielder Brennan Boesch was unable to make the catch while jumping near the wall. Alcides Escobar made it 7-2 later in the inning with an RBI single.	Miguel Cabrera hit a two-run homer in the bottom half, but another wild pickoff throw -- this one by Detroit reliever Daniel Schlereth -- helped Kansas City score a run in the eighth.	"I don't mind physical errors, but teams are going to take advantage of them," Detroit manager Jim Leyland said. "On the two bad throws by our pitchers, that let a runner go from first to third, which means they can score on a sacrifice fly, so it is even more damaging."	Betemit led off the ninth with his second double, and Getz's sacrifice fly made it 9-4.	Game notes	 Detroit DH Victor Martinez lobbed a few batting practice pitches to his son before the game. Victor Jose, 6, showed good edge-of-the-infield power while hitting from both sides of the plate. His father is also a switch hitter. ... The temperature at game time was 64 degrees, about 20 degrees warmer than for Detroit's first two home games. ... Kansas City's Billy Butler extended his hitting streak to eight games -- and 22 straight against the Tigers.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

EW YORK --  Ivan Rodriguez and the Washington Nationals took advantage of the Mets' bullpen for a satisfying Sunday win.	After being held to one run and one hit in seven innings by Chris Young, the Nationals and their experienced bench broke out against the Mets' shaky relievers for a 7-3 win in 11 innings.	Rodriguez hit a tiebreaking RBI single in the 11th inning and Laynce Nix followed with a three-run homer off the Mets' fifth reliever, Blaine Boyer (0-2), who was designated for assignment after the loss.	"If we can get into the sixth and seventh innings, we really feel good about our ballclub," Nationals manager Jim Riggleman said.	The Nationals actually left this one to the eighth, when an outfield gaffe was crucial to the outcome for the second game in a row.	Right fielder Lucas Duda misjudged Rodriguez's leadoff flyball. He sprinted toward center, but the ball sailed over his head. Rodriguez wound up with a leadoff double off D.J. Carrasco, who then walked pinch-hitter Matt Stairs with one out and gave up an RBI single to Ian Desmond before Rick Ankiel's grounder to second tied the game at 3.	"It's horrible, man," Carrasco said. "To just come in there and give the game away like that is very frustrating."	Duda was optioned to Triple-A Buffalo afterward and the Mets tried to bolster a bullpen that issued 11 walks and 10 hits in 11 innings this series by purchasing the contracts of pitchers Ryota Igarashi and Jason Isringhausen.	In the 11th, Rodriguez's hit got past second baseman Daniel Murphy, who pinch hit for Brad Emaus in the ninth after the Mets' bullpen blew a 3-1 lead in the eighth. Duda scooped up the ball, but his throw to the plate was inaccurate and pinch-runner Wilson Ramos scored easily.	"The route that was taken, I thought he was going to get there," Carrasco said. "I wasn't really worried because we had a two-run lead at the time. I twas the fact I couldn't control the cutter later on. That's what got me stuck."	Drew Storen (1-1) pitched a scoreless 10th for Washington, which salvaged a 3-3 road trip and took two of three from the Mets thanks to timely hitting from its bench players and five innings of scoreless relief.	The Nationals have won three out of four since dropping four of five to start the season.	"I think it's significant that we're playing good baseball more than anything," Nationals starter Jason Marquis said. "We started things off a bit sluggish. "	He was referring to the Nationals' season, but Young kept the Nats plenty quiet on Sunday, too.	"He got us to where we wanted to get to," Mets manager Terry Collins said. "He got us to the eighth inning and we couldn't hold it for him. It's a shame, but he pitched great."	Young looked right at home in Citi Field's wide-open spaces, getting 15 of his 21 outs on flyballs. The only groundout he allowed was Rodriguez's RBI to second base in the second inning.	Against Philadelphia last week, the big righty struck out seven and allowed one run in 5 1/3 innings in his Mets debut.	On Sunday, Adam LaRoche began the second inning with a walk and Michael Morse followed with a single to left, but Young retired 18 of the next 19 batters.	Davis got his 10th RBI, and Jose Reyes reached base in the first inning for the ninth straight game.	The Mets went up 2-0 in the first on RBI singles by David Wright and Angel Pagan. Davis added a broken-bat single in the fifth.	With the Mets' bullpen it wasn't enough.	"I guess you've got to convince them that they've got to get beat with somebody swinging the bat," Collins said. "This is the big leagues and they've got to be able to land some pitches. I'm not saying you're never going to walk somebody, but we're walking at too high a rate right now."	Game notes	 The night before, Jerry Hairston Jr. muffed a fly to left-center in the sixth inning, opening the door to a go-ahead triple by Ike Davis. On Sunday, the Mets repaid the favor. No Nationals pitcher has gone fewer than five innings yet this season, in nine games. Marquis retired nine straight between Reyes' single in the third and Willie Harris' in the fifth. Stairs drew his fourth walk in six ABs with Washington as a pinch-hitter. The Mets struck out 17 times one day after they whiffed 10 times. ... Washington 3B Ryan Zimmerman sat out. He aggravated an abdominal injury in Saturday night's game. Alex Cora played in his place. ... Carlos Beltran, who homered twice for New York the night before, pinch-hit in the ninth. His groundout to second ended the ninth. LaRoche left hurt in the 11th after reaching second base. Ramos, the backup catcher, ran for him. LaRoche said his left groin was tight.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

BALTIMORE --  There's no mystery why the Texas Rangers have the best record in the major leagues.	The Rangers have combined solid starting pitching with a bash-happy offense, qualities that were on full display Sunday in a 3-0 victory over the Baltimore Orioles.	Derek Holland allowed five hits over six innings, Adrian Beltre and Ian Kinsler homered, and the Rangers improved to 8-1 by capturing their third straight series.	Whether it be a pitching duel or a slugfest, the defending AL champions have what it takes to win.	"We can play whatever the game asks us to play. That's what we play," manager Ron Washington said. "We do have guys up and down the lineup that can punch the ball out of the ballpark. It happened today and it worked for us. Kinsler and Beltre got them, and that's all the runs we needed."	Holland (2-0) struck out six, walked two and hit a batter with a pitch. The left-hander had only one perfect inning, but he never failed to get the outs he needed.	Texas starters are 7-1 with a 2.54 ERA this season.	"They've done a great job," Washington said. "They have been able to get in there and be in some situations that's tough and be able to pitch out of them. That's what pitching is all about."	Neftali Feliz, the third Texas reliever, got four outs for his third save.	The Rangers took two of three from Baltimore and have matched the best start in franchise history (1989). The only other seasons in which Texas opened with more than two successive series wins were 1989 (five straight) and 1993 (four).	This series was marked by solid pitching performances on both sides.	"They pitched well, we pitched well," Holland said. "We made the plays when we needed to and made pitches when we really needed to. We got a few hits here and there, and they got us some runs. That's the main thing."	Beltre hit a solo homer off Jeremy Guthrie (1-1) in the fourth and Kinsler connected with a man on in the seventh off Jim Johnson. Before his two-out hit, Kinsler was 0 for 8 this season with runners in scoring position.	There will be games in which the Rangers need more than three runs. In this one, the hitting was good enough to complement solid pitching.	"We like to believe we're a well-rounded team and can do whatever it takes to win," Kinsler said.	Guthrie was pitching for the first time since opening day. After missing a start because of a high fever, the right-hander was exceptionally sharp in his return -- except for the pitch that Beltre deposited in the left-field seats.	"He gave us everything he had," manager Buck Showalter said. "He just ran out of gas at the end."	Guthrie allowed one run, four hits and a walk in six innings, but it wasn't enough to prevent the Orioles (6-3) from absorbing their first series loss of the year.	"It was a battle the whole entire time, just fighting and trying to make better pitches," Guthrie said. "I didn't always do that."	Both pitchers worked their way out of early jams.	In the first inning, Baltimore had two on with two outs before Holland struck out Mark Reynolds, who came in with a .714 batting average with runners in scoring position.	Two innings later, Reynolds stranded runners at second and third.	Texas had two on in the third when Josh Hamilton hit a liner to right that Nick Markakis caught on the run near the wall.	"The biggest play of the game was Nick's play on the Hamilton ball, caught at the wall," Guthrie said. "That was the biggest out for me in my outing."	Beltre hit his second homer in two games in the fourth. The drive came one pitch after he ripped a liner into the seats outside of the left-field foul pole.	In the Baltimore fifth, Markakis hit a two-out single and went to third on a double by Derrek Lee. Vladimir Guerrero followed with a routine fly to right.	Game notes	 In his only other start against Baltimore, Holland lost 7-0 to Guthrie in 2009. ... Markakis has reached safely in all nine games. ... Baltimore's first two pinch hitters of the season went 1 for 2. Luke Scott flied out with two on and two outs in the eighth, and Felix Pie singled in the ninth. ... Hamilton has hit in six straight games and eight of nine.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ATLANTA --  Shane Victorino didn't want to say he finally figured out a way to hit Derek Lowe.	That's OK. His manager said it for him.	Cole Hamels combined with two relievers on a five-hitter and Victorino capped a big series with three hits, including his first homer, to lead the Philadelphia Phillies past the Atlanta Braves 3-0 on Sunday.	Each of Victorino's three hits came off Lowe. Entering the day, the switch-hitter was 2 for 24 in his career against the right-hander, according to ESPN Stats & Information.	"Shane did real good," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said. "He figured out Lowe a little bit."	With Lowe attacking the outside part of the plate, Victorino went the other way for singles to left field in the first and fourth innings. When Lowe came inside, Victorino turned on the pitch for a homer to right field in the sixth.	Victorino has five straight multihit games, including four hits in the Phillies' 10-2 win over the Braves on Saturday. He had nine hits, three RBIs and two steals as the Phillies took two of three in the series.	Victorino hasn't forgotten his past struggles against Lowe.	"I wouldn't say I figured him out," Victorino said. "Today was one of those days. ... I was able to stay on it longer than I usually do and slap it the other way."	Victorino is hitting .417 through 10 games.	Hamels (1-1) gave up four hits with one walk and eight strikeouts in seven innings.	"He put it to us," said Atlanta's Dan Uggla, who was 0 for 4.	Lowe (1-2) was almost as strong. The right-hander allowed seven hits and two runs in seven innings.	Lowe said he had "a good game plan but terrible execution" against Victorino and the Phillies.	"I got outpitched," Lowe said.	Hamels rebounded after giving up seven hits and six runs in 2 2/3 innings of a 7-1 home loss to the New York Mets on Tuesday. It was the shortest season-opening start of his career, and he heard boos from the Philadelphia fans.	"I've been booed many times," Hamels said. "It's part of the game. You just go with it.	"If you get that response, it's the understanding that people know that you're good. They expect you to do well and when you don't, they're disappointed."	Hamels met those expectations against the Braves.	"I kept the ball low and I think that's a good-hitting team and I was able to make them kind of make mistakes," he said. "I got the key groundouts and a few good popouts."	Manuel said Hamels was motivated by his poor opening game.	"He was ready to go today," Manuel said. "He was definitely ready to pitch. He did a heck of a job. It was hot out there."	Ryan Madson pitched the eighth and Jose Contreras worked a perfect ninth for his second save.	Victorino singled and scored from third in the fourth when Jimmy Rollins hit into a double play. Victorino's homer into the right-field seats to lead off the sixth increased the lead to 2-0.	The Braves' only hit through five innings came with the help of questionable positioning by Phillies left fielder Raul Ibanez.	Nate McLouth hit a one-out double in the fourth over the head of Ibanez, who was playing unusually shallow. McLouth moved to third on Chipper Jones' fly to right but was stranded on Brian McCann's groundout to Hamels.	Freddie Freeman led off the sixth with a single but was stranded at second on Jones' grounder to end the inning.	Hamels began to tire in the seventh. Victorino raced to the warning track to catch McCann's fly ball to open the inning. Singles by Jason Heyward and Alex Gonzalez gave Atlanta runners on first and third, but Freeman's grounder to Michael Martinez at second base ended the inning.	Rollins led off the ninth with a double off Craig Kimbrel and advanced to third when Heyward bobbled the ball for an error. Rollins scored on Ryan Howard's grounder to shortstop -- Gonzalez considered throwing to the plate before taking the out at first base.	Carlos Ruiz, who had a homer and five RBIs on Saturday, had two hits for Philadelphia and six hits in the series.	Lowe has a losing record despite his 1.45 ERA. He gave up only one run in six innings in a 1-0 loss at Milwaukee on Tuesday.	Game notes	 Martinez made his first start at second base after one start in center field. He is the Phillies' third starter at second base, following Wilson Valdez and Pete Orr, with Chase Utley on the 15-day disabled list with a knee injury. ... Rollins, the No. 3 hitter, is batting .324 but hasn't driven in a run this season. ... Attendance was 43,796. ... Uggla was 0 for 11 in the series, including a strikeout to end the game, and is hitting .158.	Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.

PITTSBURGH --  One at-bat, one pitch, one day at a time. The Colorado Rockies have learned to slow down and not focus on anything but the next task ahead.	So far, it's working.	Almost perfectly.	Seth Smith drew a bases-loaded walk in the seventh inning, Colorado's bullpen was nearly flawless and the Rockies kept up their strong start with a 6-5 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Sunday to take three of four in their first road series this season.	The Rockies' 6-2 start is their second-best in franchise history. If not for two extra-inning losses, they'd be unbeaten.	"We're solid, it doesn't matter if we play at home or on the road," said closer Huston Street, who got his fourth save with a perfect ninth. "We expect to win."	A year ago, the Rockies collapsed down the stretch. Sitting at 82-66 on Sept. 18, they were poised for a playoff appearance before going 1-13 and finishing third in the NL West. During the slide, Colorado dropped its last eight road games.	It was a tough, humbling lesson for a team that could be on the verge of putting something special together.	"There is that sense of purpose that we don't want to give up one day," said Street, wrapped from shoulder to knee in ice. "We've learned that over the course of the last two years how important those days, especially in April and May, show up in September.	"I love our approach. It's a humble, fighting, grinding approach. We've got a lot of talent."	Smith, who had an RBI single in Colorado's four-run first, drew his two-out walk from Mike Crotta (0-1) in the seventh. Crotta walked three of the four batters he faced and gave up a tying RBI single in the inning to Jason Giambi.	"Tough day, just didn't execute my pitches; that's my job," Crotta said. "It's tough to get outs when you walk people. There's eight guys out there and if they put it in play, chances are they hit it at somebody. If you walk a guy, nobody's there to help you."	Jose Lopez hit a three-run homer in the first for the Rockies, who have been alone in first in the NL West five straight days for the first time since 2006.	Last season, the Rockies were awful on the road, posting a 31-50 record they would like to reverse in 2011.	As their jerseys and bats were packed for a trip to New York, the three wins they picked up at PNC Park may have been the best items stashed.	"There were a lot of things we didn't do well on the road last year," manager Jim Tracy said. "So we went back to the drawing board in spring training and brought up bullet points as far as 31-50 -- why did it happen? We have certainly addressed some things. We've done a better job of executing and hopefully we'll take it along with us and take us to a better place."	Jhoulys Chacin (2-0) allowed four earned runs and seven hits in six innings as Colorado's starters improved to 5-0 this season. But they wouldn't be unblemished if not for the Rockies relievers. Felipe Paulino, Matt Reynolds, Matt Lindstrom and Street combined for three hitless, scoreless innings.	"Our bullpen was terrific," said Tracy, who had to be creative the past two days after using eight pitchers in Friday's 14-inning loss.	The Rockies appeared on their way to an easy win, scoring four in the first off Pittsburgh starter James McDonald, who managed to stay around until the seventh. But Colorado's bats went dead, a problem that plagued the Rockies too often last season.	Lyle Overbay had two RBIs and Jose Tabata extended his hitting streak to 10 games for the Pirates (5-5), who are back to .500 after opening the season by winning four of six on the road, a start that had Pittsburgh fans hoping this squad could finally end 18 straight losing years.	"We're all right," Overbay said. "That's a very good team over there. They've got some good players. We just got into a situation where we didn't continue hitting. We didn't get that killer instinct."	Trailing 4-0 after one, the Pirates caught the Rockies by scoring three in the third and passed them with an unearned run in the fourth.	McDonald has had success against Colorado, recording three of his nine career wins against the Rockies.	But whatever comfort the right-hander had against them wasn't evident in the first when he struggled with his control, and the Rockies pounced with Lopez's second homer, a shot into the left-field seats that dropped the Pirates into a 4-0 hole.	Game notes	 Rockies ace Ubaldo Jimenez threw a bullpen session without any trouble. Tracy said Jimenez, who is on the 15-day disabled list with a cut finger cuticle, will next pitch in Scottsdale, Ariz., on April 13. ... The Pirates finally get a day off Monday. They were the only team in the majors to play the season's first 10 days without a break. ... Colorado has outscored its opponents 14-1 in the first. ... Rockies LF Carlos Gonzalez didn't start because of flulike symptoms. He grounded into a double play as a pinch-hitter in the ninth.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

HOUSTON --  Houston manager Brad Mills wants his players to focus on each game individually and not dwell on the mistakes they've made in past losses.	The Astros seemed to follow that advice in a 7-1 victory over Florida on Sunday, hardly resembling a team that dropped seven of its first eight.	J.A. Happ pitched four-hit ball into the eighth inning and drove in two runs with a double, and the Astros tallied a season-high 16 hits, six for extra bases.	Hunter Pence, Carlos Lee and Matt Downs also knocked in runs for Houston. Pence and Angel Sanchez had three hits apiece.	"A real good team win," Mills said. "What a pitching performance, and then everybody in the starting lineup getting a hit. That's pretty special, when you're able to put together an attack like that, that's balanced."	Happ (1-1) allowed four hits in 7 2/3 innings, only two after the Marlins took a 1-0 lead in the first inning. He put Houston ahead to stay in the fourth with a two-run double off Florida starter Anibal Sanchez (0-1).	Sanchez came in with a 1.54 ERA in two prior starts at Minute Maid Park, but gave up six runs on 13 hits in 4 2/3 innings. He lost for the first time in six career starts against the Astros.	Happ threw 117 pitches and looked strong after straining an oblique muscle in late March. He was shaky in his season debut in Cincinnati last week, giving up seven runs in four innings, but came into Sunday's game with a more confident mindset.	"I was trying to get ahead of hitters and pitch aggressively, and almost not even try to throw strikes," Happ said. "More or less just have some conviction with what I'm throwing and be aggressive with it. Everything was better in the zone."	Still, Happ got into immediate trouble, when Omar Infante doubled to the left-field corner in the first inning, and scored on Logan Morrison's single.	"That's something I need to work on," Happ said. "Sometimes, I start a little slow. I need to get going, find a way to do that."	Michael Bourn blooped a double down the left-field line in the bottom half of the first. Morrison couldn't make a sliding catch and came up limping. Florida manager Edwin Rodriguez trotted out to check on him, but Morrison stayed in the game.	Pence singled to left to tie it, his third RBI of the series.	Brett Wallace led off the Astros' fourth with an infield single and went to third on Humberto Quintero's two-out double to right. Happ then drove a hard grounder down the left-field line, his second hit of the game, to make it 3-1.	The Astros' five starting pitchers are hitting .411 (7 for 17) so far this season. Happ is 2 for 3 after going hitless in 26 at-bats last season.	"Anything is better than last year," he said. "Off to a good start."	Angel Sanchez and Pence started the Astros' half of the fifth with singles. Sanchez scored on Lee's single to right, Houston's 11th hit. Pence scored for a 5-1 lead when Wallace grounded into a double play.	Bill Hall then tripled and scored on Downs' double to nearly the same spot in right center. Brian Sanches relieved Anibal Sanchez.	"Everything was working good, but nothing happened right," Anibal Sanchez said. "They took a lot of swings and made a lot of contact. Nothing good was happening. All the hits were good pitches."	Happ needed only 11 pitches to retire the Marlins in order in the sixth. He reached 100 pitches in the seventh, getting Donnie Murphy on a harmless flyout to end the inning.	"Happ had his paintbrush out," Morrison said. "He was doing pretty well, mixing up speeds. He kept us off-balance."	Plate umpire Jim Joyce ejected Florida reliever Edward Mujica in the seventh, when he hit Hall with a pitch. Hall scored on Quintero's drive off the right-field fence, but Quintero was thrown out trying to stretch the double into a triple.	Joyce ejected Astros' reliever Aneury Rodriguez in the ninth when he hit Gaby Sanchez with a pitch. Mills protested, to no avail. Jeff Fulchino got the final three outs for the Astros.	Game notes	 Edwin Rodriguez is "very optimistic" that injured SS Hanley Ramirez will start Tuesday's game in Atlanta after the team's off day on Monday. Ramirez sustained a bruised left shin on Hall's takeout slide in the seventh inning of Friday's game. "He's a little sore, but he's doing fine," Rodriguez said. ... Struggling Astros 3B Chris Johnson was out of the starting lineup for the first time this season, replaced by Downs. Johnson was 1 for 8 in the first two games of the Florida series, and hitting .200 so far this year. Mills said Johnson will be back in the lineup for Monday's game against Chicago.

CHICAGO --  Paul Konerko homered twice Sunday and is off to a torrid start, yet he refuses to take any credit for the White Sox's early success.	Konerko went deep in the first and fifth innings and Gavin Floyd delivered a masterful performance on the mound as the Chicago White Sox beat the slumping Tampa Bay Rays 6-1.	Konerko has three homers and 11 RBIs through the team's first nine games. He has a 10-game hitting streak dating back to last year and has driven in a run in all but one game so far this season.	Still, the White Sox captain diverted credit to Juan Pierre, Gordon Beckham and even hitting coach Greg Walker.	"They got it going right from the get-go in Cleveland and haven't stopped yet," Konerko said of Pierre and Beckham, the No. 1 and 2 hitters in the lineup. "They've been getting on base, having quality at-bats and they've been tough on the other team. That makes it easier for the guys in the middle."	Konerko wasn't feeling quite right before the game, but a few tips in the batting cage from Walker seemed to straighten things out.	"I'd been hitting some balls hard, but hooking the ball and getting around some pitches I'd normally get in the air and drive with some carry," he said. "[Walker] gave me something that seemed to click."	Floyd (1-0) struck out eight, allowing just four hits and one unearned run. He retired 16 of the first 18 batters he faced. Floyd allowed a one-out double to Matt Joyce in the second, but then retired the next 12 Rays.	It was an important building block for Floyd, who allowed four runs over seven innings against Kansas City in his first start of the year.	"I felt real strong, comfortable out there," the righty said. "I have confidence in myself to go out there and compete. I just go out there and concentrate on the mitt."	Floyd went 10-13 with a 4.08 ERA last year, but also went on a 12-start tear where he posted a 1.19 ERA in the middle of the season. The White Sox are hoping to see more of that version of Floyd this season.	"He's aggressive, he throws strikes, his breaking ball was working," White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen said. "He kept the ball down, that was key."	The loss dropped the Rays to 1-8, the worst start to a season in franchise history. Tampa Bay has scored 11 runs in its eight losses, and put nine runs on the board in its only win.	Sam Fuld broke Floyd's streak with a double in the sixth, and Johnny Damon followed with a single. With runners on first and third, Floyd caught Damon trying to steal second, but his wild throw ended up in center field, allowing Fuld to score.	Dan Johnson then hit a grounder to first, which deflected off Konerko's glove. Beckham recovered and threw to Floyd, who dropped the ball while removing it from his glove.	First base umpire Doug Eddings called Johnson safe, but after Guillen came out to dispute the call, the umps convened and reversed it, prompting a visit from Rays manager Joe Maddon, who argued vehemently and was ejected by Eddings.	"I've never seen that call made before, where an umpire calls a bobble and then it's overturned from a great distance. I really did not like that, obviously," Maddon said after the game. "The play was overturned from over 100 feet away"	At one point during the argument, Maddon motioned as if he were throwing Eddings out of the game.	Jeff Niemann (0-2) only made it 46 pitches into his second start of the season. He allowed five runs on five hits over 2 2/3 innings. Three of the runs charged to him were earned.	The White Sox established their offense early, courtesy of two first-inning home runs. Beckham drove a 1-0 pitch off the top of the left field wall that bounced over for his second of the year, and two batters later, Konerko launched the first pitch he saw 379 feet into the left field seats.	In the second, Brent Morel knocked in Mark Teahen with an RBI double, then came around to score on Juan Pierre's single, extending the lead to 4-0.	A.J. Pierzynski chased Niemann in the third inning with an RBI single. Andy Sonnanstine came on in relief, retiring five of six batters until Konerko came to the plate in the fifth, sending a 2-1 pitch over the bullpen in left field.	Sonnanstine gave his manager something to gush about, allowing just three hits over the last 5 1/3 innings for the Rays, Konerko's long ball the lone blemish on his day.	"Sonny did a wonderful job. Really saves the rest of your bullpen going into a big series in Boston," Maddon said. "Magnificent job by Sonny."	Game notes	 Rays 3B Felipe Lopez was not in the lineup, a day after a confrontation with Pierzynski. Lopez maintained his innocence after hitting a ninth inning home run Saturday, flipping his bat in the direction of White Sox LHP Chris Sale. Maddon said he hopes to talk to Guillen about the incident to make sure there are no lingering issues. "That's not who we are," Maddon said of the bat flip. "We don't do that here." White Sox DH Adam Dunn (appendicitis) took batting practice Sunday and according to Guillen, should have a clear timetable for his return by Monday. Dunn had surgery on Tuesday and was originally expected to miss five games.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

MILWAUKEE --  Casey McGehee was in awe of Kerry Wood's fastball while the two were with the Cubs when McGehee was still a prospect in 2004.	McGehee can catch up with the veteran reliever's hardest pitches now. He delivered a pinch-hit, two-run homer with two outs in the eighth inning off Wood and the Milwaukee Brewers rallied to beat Chicago 6-5 on Sunday.	"It was kind of a weird feeling," said McGehee, who said he looked up to Wood while the two were in the Cubs' organization. "By no means was I going up there looking to hit a ball out of the ballpark."	Prince Fielder and Ryan Braun each hit a two-run homer for Milwaukee, which has won five of six after an 0-4 start.	This was the Brewers' most dramatic win this season.	McGehee had been mired in a 3-for-22 slump this homestand and didn't get the start. He'd expected to clear his thoughts with the day off before heading to the plate in a crucial situation.	"I put him up there because I felt like he could do it," Brewers manager Ron Roenicke said. "I don't think all the time you look at exactly what a guy's doing during that time. Here's a guy that drove in [104] runs last year. He was the right guy to put up in that situation."	Wood (0-1) walked Yuniesky Betancourt after getting ahead 0-2 to open the eighth and Betancourt reached second on a sacrifice bunt. George Kottaras struck out, bringing up McGehee.	"I'd been pretty frustrated the way I've been swinging the bat, or not swinging, but the pitches I've been swinging at the last couple of days," McGehee said. "Luckily, the wind was blowing pretty good that way."	McGehee hit the second fastball he saw into the Cubs' bullpen in right.	"Home runs happen. Can't walk guys late in a game. That's why," Wood said. "We know we're going to play tight games. That's part of it. You start the inning off with a walk, you put yourself behind the 8-ball."	Chicago's Aramis Ramirez drove in three runs and had three doubles, but the bullpen couldn't hold on.	After Yovani Gallardo labored through five innings, Milwaukee's bullpen ran into trouble in the seventh, with relievers Sean Green, Mitch Stetter and Kameron Loe each allowing a runner to load the bases with one out.	Tyler Colvin's RBI groundout off Loe (1-0) gave the Cubs a 5-4 lead, but it didn't last thanks to McGehee.	Brewers closer John Axford allowed a leadoff single to Marlon Byrd in the ninth, but Byrd was caught stealing by Kottaras, and Axford retired Ramirez and Carlos Pena for his third save in four opportunities.	"It was a fantastic homestand, it really was," Axford said. "We really battled a lot. We got some fantastic pitching, some fantastic offense and defense."	Ramirez had started this road trip that continues Monday in Houston 1 for 8 before doubling down the left-field line in the first inning to drive in two. Fielder tied it in the bottom of the first with his second homer.	"You never want to be out of it," said Fielder, who is 11 for 18 with two home runs and 11 RBIs in his last four games after a 3-for-17 start. "We'd like to go to the playoffs. That'd be cool."	Chicago added runs in the second on Darwin Barney's RBI single and the third on Ramirez's run-scoring double to put the Cubs up 4-2, but Milwaukee tied it again on Braun's two-run shot off Casey Coleman in the bottom of the third.	Coleman got the start because Randy Wells (right forearm) is on the disabled list.	Cubs right fielder Kosuke Fukudome saved a run in the second with a diving catch for the third out and made a shoestring grab with two on and one out in the fifth to keep the game tied.	After doubling for the third time in the fifth, Ramirez was thrown out at the plate when third baseman Craig Counsell went home with Geovany Soto's slow roller to set up the back-and-forth finish.	"We were just looking for a knockout punch all day long offensively," Cubs manager Mike Quade said. "We're just not giving ourselves much room for error."	Game notes	 Coleman hit his second career double in the fourth. ... With a day off on Monday, Brewers RHP Takashi Saito (hamstring) is not expected to go on the disabled list despite his nagging injury. ... Cubs OF Alfonso Soriano also was out of the starting lineup, but pinch hit in the sixth for Fukudome, who left with a mild hamstring strain and is day to day. ... Brewers LHP Manny Parra (back) will report to Triple-A Nashville on Tuesday for his second rehab start.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Hideki Matsui wasn't the only one getting a little anxious for his first home run in an Athletics uniform.	The Oakland pitching staff was just as excited to see the veteran send one soaring into the Target Field stands.	Matsui homered to help the Athletics break out of a season-long offensive slump and Brandon McCarthy pitched into the eighth inning in Oakland's 5-3 victory over the Minnesota Twins on Sunday.	"I'm just happy to get one," Matsui said through an interpreter. "And we won the game, as well."	Matsui was signed in the offseason to provide another veteran bat to complement a young, talented pitching corps. But he entered the game Sunday hitting just .160 with no homers and three RBIs.	He led off the fourth inning with a solo shot that bounced off a scoreboard in deep right-center field to get the A's on the board. Josh Willingham added another one in a four-run sixth inning.	"You know it's going to come," A's manager Bob Geren said of Matsui, who also had a single and two runs scored. "To see that performance, that ball jumped out of here in a hurry. He got the whole bench really excited."	McCarthy (1-0) allowed two runs and nine hits with five strikeouts in 7 1/3 innings for his first win since 2009 after not pitching in the majors last year because of shoulder problems. Brian Fuentes earned his third save.	Justin Morneau had three hits and an RBI for the Twins, and Jim Thome hit his first homer of the season. But their three-run eighth was too little, too late on another slow day for the offense.	Scott Baker (0-2) gave up four runs and seven hits with two walks and five strikeouts in five innings.	Landon Powell had two hits and an RBI, and the A's scored four runs in the sixth inning -- they scored four total in their previous four games -- to take a 5-0 lead. Oakland has given McCarthy five runs of support in both starts, but is averaging just 2.7 runs in its other seven games.	"I think they like me more than the other guys," McCarthy joked. "I think it's because I have a better personality."	The way the Twins had been swinging the bats, that lead seemed insurmountable. But McCarthy gave up a single to Denard Span and a double to Joe Mauer to start the eighth. After Morneau drove in Span with a groundout, Thome launched his two-run homer off lefty Jerry Blevins  over the 36-foot high wall behind the center-field fence to make it 5-3.	Fuentes, who hasn't allowed a run to the Twins in seven career appearances, slammed the door in the ninth to close it out.	Oakland entered the game with just 24 runs in eight games, the third-fewest in the American League. Yet even they were ahead of the Twins, who had 21.	Twins manager Ron Gardenhire pulled out all the stops to try to jump-start his struggling lineup, moving Michael Cuddyer from right field to second base and giving Mauer a rare day game behind the plate.	"We just got to get swinging better," Gardenhire said. "It's frustrating for the guys, but at least we kept battling."	On paper it looked quite formidable with Mauer hitting second followed by Morneau, Thome, Delmon Young, Jason Kubel and Cuddyer against a right-handed pitcher, ideal for Minnesota's lefty-heavy lineup.	But McCarthy chewed them up all game, pounding the strike zone and recording 11 groundouts.	The series featured good pitching and anemic offenses, with the teams combining to score 12 runs in the three games. Runs were at such a premium that when Matsui's homer slammed off the scoreboard on the facing of the second deck in right-center, the hometown fans let out a groan as if the game had ended right there.	Willingham led off the sixth with a towering home run to left field that traveled an estimated 427 feet. Kevin Kouzmanoff and Cliff Pennington added sacrifice flies, and Powell had an RBI double to make it 5-0.	"It was good that the offense came together," Matsui said. "The starting pitching has been pitching well, but they weren't quite getting the offensive support."	Game notes	 Thome's two RBIs gave him 1,629, moving him past Harold Baines for 29th on the career list. ... Mauer received his 2010 Gold Glove before the game. ... The Twins also honored the University of Minnesota-Duluth men's hockey team, which won the national championship Saturday night with an overtime victory against Michigan. ... Ryan Sweeney got his first start of the season for the A's in right field, going 1 for 3 with a double.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Less than 24 hours after using all seven of his relievers for the second time in four games to grind out a 14-inning victory -- with starter Dan Haren as his last pitcher -- Angels manager Mike Scioscia needed Jered Weaver to pitch deep into the game in his first home start of the season.	The ace right-hander more than obliged, striking out a career-high 15 over 7 2/3 innings Sunday in a 3-1 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays. Weaver allowed a run and four hits while throwing 125 pitches.	"I just wanted to go out there, knowing that we had a long one last night, and I wanted to try to extend it as much as possible," Weaver said. "We were able to get three runs, and that was enough to work with.	"It's a tough lineup to face, but I had my fastball command early and my slider was as good as it's been in a long time. So I matched up pretty well with a bunch of righties in the lineup."	The Angels got some additional help from a costly error by Toronto center fielder Rajai Davis that led to a pair of unearned runs in the fourth. Peter Bourjos drove them in with a triple, helping Los Angeles take two of three in the series.	In the eighth, it came down to a showdown between Weaver and Jose Bautista, last year's major league home run leader. Bautista represented the go-ahead run at the plate after a pair of one-out walks, but Weaver struck him out with his final pitch of the day.	"I'm not going to lie. I was obviously getting a little tired," Weaver said. "I had too many walks again (four), but I was still able to extend myself as much as possible. Sosh let me do that. That 3-2 pitch to Bautista was a slider -- and thank God he swung at it, or else it would have been bases loaded."	Hisanori Takahashi came in to retire cleanup hitter Adam Lind on a comebacker and Fernando Rodney pitched a perfect ninth for his second save.	Weaver became the first Angels pitcher with 15 strikeouts in a game since May 23, 1995, when left-hander Chuck Finley fanned 15 Yankees and pitched a two-hitter in a 10-0 win at the Big A.	"I'm not going out there trying to strike everybody out," Weaver said. "I'm just trying to get a first-pitch fastball over for a strike and trying to get ahead in the count and trying to keep my team in the game. And if it takes a couple of strikeouts here and there, then that's what it's going to take."	Weaver, whose 233 strikeouts last year made him the first Angels pitcher to lead the big leagues in that category since Nolan Ryan in 1977, faced a team that produced a major league-best 257 home runs and fanned seven of his first 10 batters. He beat the Blue Jays for the fifth straight time, improving to 7-1 against them with a 2.68 ERA.	"I'm pretty sure a pitcher can get in a team's head. I've seen it happen. But I think anybody that he faced today, he probably would have had their number," teammate Torii Hunter said. "He hit his spots in and out, hard and soft, and he was hitting the corners with his changeup. He had 15 strikeouts, so not too many people were going to hit him today."	This is the first time Weaver has won his first three starts of a season since his 2006 rookie campaign, when he won his first seven outings and his first nine decisions overall. The six-year veteran has allowed just two earned runs in 20 2/3 innings this season. In 2010, he led the majors with a 1.86 ERA in home games.	The Blue Jays had no hits and two walks through the first 4 1/3 innings before Travis Snider beat out an infield single to the right of second base.	Jo-Jo Reyes (0-1) gave up three runs -- one earned -- and six hits in seven innings with six strikeouts.	Hunter opened the scoring with an RBI single in the first. Alberto Callaspo led off the fourth with an infield single back to the box that was too hot for Reyes to handle cleanly, and Mark Trumbo followed with a fly to center that Davis dropped. Two outs later, Bourjos hit a liner toward the wall in right-center that increased the lead to 3-0.	Davis left in the fifth because of right ankle irritation from a previous injury.	"He's dealing with some lingering effects of the ankle and he's probably going to need a couple or three days," manager John Farrell said. "We need to give him a little time to try to get ahead of it. I don't necessarily think the soreness in the ankle led to that particular play, just because he was able to get himself in position underneath the ball."	Angels left fielder Vernon Wells was 1 for 13 with one RBI in his first series against the team he spent his first 12 big league seasons with. His most embarrassing moment came in the Blue Jays' sixth inning, when he lost track of the number of outs after Toronto finally broke through against Weaver with an RBI single by Yunel Escobar.	Bautista took a third strike he thought was off the plate, and Wells caught Lind's lazy fly for the second out. He started to jog in with his head down, then realized it wasn't the third out, and both runners alertly moved up a base. But Weaver bailed out his new teammate by retiring Aaron Hill on a popup.	"He said that hasn't happened to him in seven years," Hunter said of Wells' mistake. "So he got it out of the way, and it probably won't happen to him for another seven years. I've done it once or twice in my career, too."	Game notes	 Among the sellout crowd of 43,525 was Anaheim Ducks 50-goal scorer Corey Perry, taking a breather before they begin the NHL playoffs. ... Before the game, the Angels placed SS Erick Aybar on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to April 3, because of a strained oblique muscle on his left side. RHP Francisco Rodriguez was recalled from Triple-A Salt Lake. ... Weaver has allowed three earned runs or fewer in his last 10 starts with a 1.90 ERA during that stretch.

SAN DIEGO --  Ryan Ludwick may have finally found his stroke with the Padres.	Ludwick, mired in a 2 for 23 slump to start the season, hit a go-ahead homer to back Aaron Harang's six solid innings and San Diego beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 7-2 on Sunday.	Ludwick, who is being counted on to swing a big bat in the middle of San Diego's lineup, connected for his first home run of season that put the Padres ahead to stay at 2-1.	The fourth-inning shot leading off against John Ely (0-1) went an estimated 438 feet into the left-field seats.	"The one Ludwick hit is out of any park in America," San Diego manager Bud Black said. "That ball was crushed."	Nick Hundley added a two-run shot and Cameron Maybin hit a solo home run and had an RBI triple as the Padres avoided a three-game sweep.	Ludwick struggled last year when he hit just .211 with the Padres after being acquired from St. Louis at the July 31 trade deadline in a three-team deal.	"Ryan is going to be fine," Hundley said. "You don't do what he's done in his career without knowing what you are doing out there. I think at times, he puts a lot of pressure on himself because he cares."	Black agreed Ludwick might have been pressing, but said he isn't worried.	"He knows his place on this team and what his presence means to our team," Black said. "He takes it hard when he is not playing well. But he had some good swings today, a couple of good at-bats. Hopefully, it is the start of something big for him."	Harang (2-0) turned in his second solid performance, allowing two runs -- one earned -- on three hits. The first run he allowed came without the benefit of a hit while the second scored on Harang's throwing error.	Harang and three relievers combined on a three-hitter.	"They are an aggressive team," Harang said. "They come out swinging, especially early in the count. If you go out and establish that you are going to get ahead early, they are going to swing at your pitches."	Hundley, who has hit safely in all seven games he's played this season, took Ely deep into the Padres' center field bullpen in the sixth right after Ludwick drew a two-out walk.	Ely, who was recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque before the game, nearly matched Harang for the first five innings. Ely, who struck out five and walked three, struck out the first two batters in the sixth before he walked Ludwick and Hundley hit a first-pitch fastball for his second home run.	"I think I settled in after the second inning and the home run to Ludwick," Ely said. "Obviously, in the sixth, after getting two quick outs, you want to shut them down and put up a zero."	Tony Gwynn Jr., who had a big day against his former team on Saturday when the Dodgers won twice, led off the game with a walk, stole second and scored on Andre Ethier's ground out.	The Padres tied the score 1-all in the third as Jorge Cantu's RBI single scored Orlando Hudson, who reached on a double.	Game notes	 San Diego is planning to activate RHP Mat Latos from the 15-day disabled list (strained right shoulder) so he can make his first start of the season. LHP Wade LeBlanc, recalled from Triple-A Tucson on Sunday, is scheduled to be optioned back. ... Dodgers SS Rafael Furcal took the day off with a sore left wrist, but was available to bunt as a pinch hitter or as a defensive replacement. ... Padres manager Bud Black confirmed that LHP Clayton Richard, who pitched just one inning Friday night before a rain delay of 1 hour, 34 minutes, will pitch Tuesday against Cincinnati. Tim Stauffer, who had been penciled in for Tuesday, will be the starter Wednesday afternoon against the Reds. ... San Diego reinstated utility man Eric Patterson from the 15-day disabled list. ... The Dodgers originally were going to send down reserve C A.J. Ellis to Triple-A Albuquerque but changed course when they found out that C Hector Gimenez had inflammation in his right knee, forcing them to place Jimenez on the DL.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Kyle Lohse and David Freese provided just the kind of performance the struggling St. Louis Cardinals needed to get out of their early-season rut.	Lohse allowed one run in eight sharp innings and Freese went 3 for 4 with a homer and three RBIs to help the Cardinals snap a three-game losing streak with a 6-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants on Sunday.	"You can't get too worried about the way things are going this early," Lohse said. "Obviously you don't want it to turn into a trend. Most of us have been around long enough to know it's not going to last forever. We just have to weather the storm and get through it and things will right themselves."	Matt Holliday scored the go-ahead run and added an RBI single in his first game since undergoing an appendectomy April 1 to help the Cardinals win for just the third time in nine games this season. Skip Schumaker added a two-run double in a three-run sixth that gave the Cardinals the lead for good.	Barry Zito (0-1) walked five batters, including two who later scored, and the Giants were unable to complete their first three-game sweep of the Cardinals since 2001.	"All day I was battling my timing in the delivery," Zito said. "The ball was getting up. That's the core of my frustration in the outing was not throwing strikes. I've been throwing strikes all spring. It was a timing issue with the delivery. It's just something that gets out of whack when you try to do too much."	After San Francisco overcame ninth-inning deficits to win the first two games of this series, the Cardinals managed to hold onto this lead without using struggling closer Ryan Franklin. Lohse (1-1) allowed five hits and handed a big lead over to Trever Miller, who finished with a scoreless ninth.	"You have to start somewhere," manager Tony La Russa said. "You build a little momentum and a little confidence and you build on it. Hopefully this is where it starts."	St. Louis also got the win despite another rough day for three-time NL MVP Albert Pujols, whose early struggles have played a big part in St. Louis' slow start. Pujols, in the final year of his contract, went 0 for 5 to drop his average to .143 with just one extra-base hit through nine games.	Pujols hit into a double play after the Cardinals put the first two batters on in the third inning and was taunted before his next at-bat by fans chanting "one-five-six" for his season average at that point.	After Pujols grounded out to lead off the sixth, the Cardinals started their go-ahead rally when Zito walked Holliday and Allen Craig. Freese then hit an RBI double to make it 2-1 and Schumaker added a two-run double that hit off center fielder Aaron Rowand's glove after a long run to the gap in left-center.	That gave the Cardinals their first three-run inning of the season and gave Lohse some breathing room on the mound.	"We have the type of offense that can put up big numbers," Freese said. "Hopefully it's a domino effect and we can get things going."	Schumaker's hit ended the day for Zito, who allowed four runs, six hits and five walks in 5 1/3 innings to lose his first home start since getting booed off the mound on the final weekend of the regular season last year.	Holliday added an RBI single in the seventh, giving him four hits and three RBIs in just two games this season. Freese led off the eighth with his first homer off Guillermo Mota to make it 6-1.	The loss capped a celebratory weekend in San Francisco, where the Giants raised their World Series championship banner before Friday's home opener, handed out World Series rings Saturday and honored 2010 NL Rookie of the Year Buster Posey in a pregame ceremony Sunday.	After getting wins following the first two celebrations, the Giants fell short Sunday and now can get ready to play games without all the pomp and circumstance.	"I don't want to say it's a relief. We were looking forward to it," manager Bruce Bochy said. "There might have been a little hangover today. It's been a very emotional first couple of games here but their guy pitched well. Give him credit. That's where it starts. He was on top of his game."	Game notes	 Posey was one of a handful of regulars who got the day off for the Giants, with CF Andres Torres sitting with a mild left Achilles' strain and SS Miguel Tejada getting a planned day off. ... Cardinals C Gerald Laird was hit in the helmet by Pablo Sandoval's broken bat on an RBI single in the first inning but stayed in the game.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

SEATTLE --  Asdrubal Cabrera has never been considered a power hitter. His career high for a season is six home runs.	Barely a week into the 2011 campaign, Cabrera already has three homers and the surging Indians are the surprise leaders of the AL Central.	Cabrera welcomed Erik Bedard back to Safeco Field with a solo shot and the Indians beat the Seattle Mariners 6-4 on Sunday for their seventh straight victory.	Cleveland completed an impressive three-game sweep of the struggling Mariners and is off to a 7-2 start for the first time since beginning the 2002 season 8-1.	"We're playing good baseball right now," Indians manager Manny Acta said. "I know it's early. We continue to get good pitching and play good defense and good things are going to happen."	Cabrera, who had three hits, was only the beginning of Cleveland's hit parade against Bedard, who was making his first home start for the Mariners since late July 2009. Bedard (0-2) gave up another homer to Jack Hannahan in the fourth, and doubles to Michael Brantley, Lou Marson and Orlando Cabrera. The left-hander lasted just four innings as Seattle dropped its seventh straight.	Asdrubal Cabrera missed a large chunk of last season with a broken forearm. During spring training, the infielder made some adjustments in his swing, no longer choking up early in the count, then shortening his swing when he gets two strikes.	Either way, he is hitting the ball hard. He homered Friday night on a 2-1 pitch before driving a 1-2 delivery from Bedard just over the hand-operated scoreboard in left two batters into Sunday's game.	"Just try and hit the ball," Asdrubal Cabrera said. "Swing a little harder."	The early runs from the Indians' offense were more than enough for starter Josh Tomlin, who extended his club record of pitching at least five innings in all 14 career starts since he was called up from the minors last July.	Tomlin allowed just a pair of singles into the seventh before giving up a two-run homer to Ryan Langerhans. Tomlin went 6 2/3 innings, giving up three hits and three runs, nearly matching his first start this season against Boston when he went seven innings, giving up three hits and one run.	Tomlin struck out four, but also walked three batters, helping lead to his high pitch count that eventually got him lifted in the seventh.	"My main goal is to go as deep as I can and give us a chance every time I go out there," Tomlin said. "If that record, I don't know what it is to be honest with you, if it keeps going then I'm fine with that."	Seattle pulled within 6-4 after Langerhans and Michael Saunders homered in the seventh, but the trio of Rafael Perez, Tony Sipp and Chris Perez shut down Seattle for the second straight night.	Rafael Perez got Ichiro Suzuki to line out to center to end the inning with Brantley making a good play to keep from trapping the sinking liner. Sipp then pitched a perfect eighth and Chris Perez worked the ninth for his fourth save of the season and 14th straight dating to last August.	Bedard's first mistake was giving Asdrubal Cabrera a hittable 1-2 pitch that he drove out, but then followed up by allowing a two-out RBI double to Shelley Duncan after Shin-Soo Choo reached on a check-swing dribbler that stopped just inches from going foul.	Bedard gave up consecutive two-out doubles to Marson and Brantley in the second, and Asdrubal Cabrera added an RBI single to cap the inning.	Seattle's defensive troubles also flared up again in the third when a high throw by Suzuki from the outfield allowed Choo to score on Orlando Cabrera's double.	Bedard gave up 10 hits and struck out six, but was done by the fifth after throwing 83 pitches.	"It's been a year and a half since I've thrown, so it might take a little while," he said. "I'm working hard and trying to get back as quick as I can."	Game notes	 Seattle reliever David Pauley was one bright spot for the Mariners. In relief of Bedard, Pauley threw three perfect innings, striking out three. Seattle's bullpen allowed just one hit in five innings. ... Cleveland is 4-1 against left-handed starters and is batting .333 versus left-handed pitching. ... Saunders has an RBI in his first five games this season, tying a club record.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

PHOENIX --  An early five-run deficit did not stop the Arizona Diamondbacks. Nor did they fade for good when their big comeback provided a lead that didn't last.	Chris Young hit the decisive three-run homer and Stephen Drew had four hits and three RBIs, helping the Diamondbacks rally twice to beat Cincinnati 10-8 on Sunday and take two of three from the Reds.	"We're going to be a persistent team," Young said.	Drew's RBI single tied it at 7 in the eighth inning, then Young drove a 3-2 pitch from Nick Masset (0-2) into the seats in left-center to put Arizona ahead for only the second time all day.	"The play of the game was the pitch before," Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson said, "when he fouled the little, light cutter off, got a piece of it, then he got something he could handle the next pitch and pounded it."	The Reds led 5-0 after 2 1/2 innings before Arizona scored five in the fifth off Mike Leake, the last three on Ryan Roberts' homer, to go up 6-5.	"What hurt us was a pair of two-out, three-run homers," Cincinnati manager Dusty Baker said. "It was a matter of location. One ball was supposed to be in, the other away and they were down the heart of the plate and they didn't miss them."	Jonny Gomes' two-run homer off Aaron Heilman in the seventh put Cincinnati back on top 7-6.	"We didn't give up after that even," Gibson said. "That's just how you've got to be. You never know. There's no reason ever to give in to it. The notion is the frustration can control you if you let it. It was very good for us the way we hung in there."	Heilman (1-0) allowed two runs and two hits in three innings to get the win. J.J. Putz got through a shaky ninth to earn his third save in three opportunities.	Joey Votto tied a career best with four hits, the last a single to put runners on first and third with no outs in the ninth. Scott Rolen hit a shot to right-center but Young ran it down to limit it to a sacrifice fly. Gomes singled, but Putz came back from a 3-1 count to strike out pinch-hitter Juan Francisco, then fanned Jay Bruce to finally end it.	The Reds took advantage of Arizona starter Joe Saunders' control woes to lead 5-0 after 2 1/2 innings and were up 5-1 going into the bottom of the fifth, an inning that Leake, the former Arizona State star, never finished.	The Diamondbacks opened the inning with four consecutive singles. With two outs, Roberts -- the last player to make Arizona's 25-man opening-day roster -- hit Leake's 1-0 pitch into the seats in left-center to put the Diamondbacks ahead 6-5.	"I got a couple of unlucky rolls with infield hits, then a big mistake throwing a fastball down the middle," Leake said. "He made me pay."	Heilman retired the side in the sixth, but in the seventh Rolen singled with one out and Gomes lined one into the left-field stands to put the Reds ahead 7-6.	Leake, in his first appearance against the Diamondbacks, allowed six runs and nine hits in 4 2/3 innings, striking out four and walking two.	Saunders lasted just three innings, giving up five runs, four earned, while walking five and striking out one.	Saunders walked three in the first inning, including one with the bases loaded, as Cincinnati jumped out to a 3-0 lead. With two outs in the second, Saunders walked Drew Stubbs, then Brandon Phillips doubled to put runners on second and third. Votto singled to right to bring home Stubbs, but Justin Upton threw out Phillips trying to score from second. Henry Blanco made the tag after Phillips slid past the plate.	"For those guys to pick me up was special," Saunders said of his teammates. "I'm just proud to be a part of this club."	Game notes	 Drew reached base five times, the fifth on a walk. ... The Diamondbacks rested C Miguel Montero, whose .500 average (13 for 26) leads the NL, to give Blanco his first playing time of the season. ... Baker needs one win to become the 11th manager in major league history to win 250 games with three teams (San Francisco, the Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati). ... Arizona, on a nine-game homestand, plays the next three against St. Louis, starting Monday night.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

BOSTON --  The Red Sox's horrible start to the season didn't put pressure on Josh Beckett to pitch one of the best games of his career.	He did anyway.	Beckett allowed two singles and one walk and struck out 10 in eight innings, a rare strong outing by a Boston starter that led to a 4-0 win over the New York Yankees on Sunday night. The Red Sox took two of three games from their rivals after starting the season 0-6 on the road.	"When our turn [in the rotation] comes, we're not thinking about what happened yesterday or in the future," Beckett said. "You just take it really day by day."	Beckett (1-1) retired the first seven batters he faced and the last 14. He allowed singles to Eric Chavez in the third inning and Robinson Cano in the fourth. Only two of his outs made it to the outfield.	The right-hander was dropped to fourth in the season-opening rotation after going 6-6 with a 5.78 ERA in an injury-plagued 2010 season. He faced the Yankees five times last year, going 1-2 with a 10.04 ERA. Going into Sunday's game, Red Sox starters were 1-5 with a 7.41 ERA this year.	That all changed with Beckett's start Sunday against Yankees ace CC Sabathia (0-1).	"It was great, one of his best," catcher Jason Varitek said. "We needed a good, quality start, especially when you have that other guy on the mound over there. And we got a huge, quality start out of Josh."	After losing three games in Texas and another three in Cleveland, their worst start to a season since they lost the first eight in 1945, the Red Sox won their home opener 9-6 on Friday before losing 9-4 on Saturday.	"I think we were just ready to come home," Beckett said. "That was a pretty tough break, what we went through on the road."	Jonathan Papelbon struck out two of the three batters he faced in the ninth in a non-save situation.	Dustin Pedroia reached base all five times he went to bat with three singles -- all against Sabathia -- an intentional walk and a force play. He got on base in 10 of his last 11 trips to the plate as the Red Sox won despite stranding 16 runners, including three in both the sixth and seventh innings.	Beckett retired four of the first seven hitters on strikeouts before Chavez singled to center and Russell Martin was hit by a pitch. But Brett Gardner grounded into a double play, "the biggest part of the game," Varitek said.	Beckett struck out Derek Jeter to start the fourth then walked Mark Teixeira, who took second on Cano's single, the last Yankee to reach base in the game. Beckett got out of the inning by striking out Curtis Granderson and retiring Nick Swisher on a ground ball.	"From the very beginning, he was commanding all of his pitches," Boston manager Terry Francona said. "He was really, really good."	Alex Rodriguez had flulike symptoms and was a late scratch from the New York lineup.	"He looked wiped out," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "Hopefully, the rest today and the rest tomorrow [a day off for the team] and he'll be back at full strength."	The Red Sox took a 1-0 lead in the third on Mike Cameron's RBI single but kept wasting opportunities as they stranded 12 runners through six innings.	"CC knows how to get out of situations," Girardi said. "I think we're going to have a lot of tough games with them."	The Red Sox finally scored again in the seventh on Marco Scutaro's two-run single. David Ortiz began the inning with a walk and Cameron struck out, but J.D. Drew walked and Varitek singled, loading the bases for Scutaro.	Boston made it 4-0 in the eighth on a leadoff walk to Kevin Youkilis and a long double off the center field wall by Ortiz.	A baserunning gaffe by Youkilis cost the Red Sox a run in the second. Boston loaded the bases on singles by Pedroia and Gonzalez and a walk to Youkilis. Ortiz grounded to second baseman Cano, who threw for an apparent force out at second to Jeter, whose relay to first got Ortiz.	Pedroia went home and Gonzalez took third on the play. But Youkilis was called out for leaving the baseline, sending Pedroia back to third and Gonzalez to second while allowing the out on Ortiz at first. Cameron then singled home Pedroia before Drew struck out.	Game notes	 Beckett struck out at least 10 for the 11th time and first since July 27, 2009. ... Teixeira was 0 for 12 in the series. ... Red Sox RHP Clay Buchholz and the team agreed to a four-year deal through 2015 that includes club options for 2016 and 2017. He was second in the AL with a 2.33 ERA and made the All-Star team last year but is 0-2 with a 7.20 ERA this season. ... Cano has reached base in 16 straight games at Fenway Park, starting on June 11, 2009. ... Sabathia is winless despite a 1.45 ERA in three starts. ... Drew has reached base in all seven games he's played this year.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

DETROIT --  The Texas Rangers are making all the right moves.	Alexi Ogando outpitched Justin Verlander before leaving with a finger problem and Texas won with a bold strategy, beating the Detroit Tigers 2-0 Monday.	Rangers manager Ron Washington chose to have closer Neftali Feliz intentionally walk slugger Miguel Cabrera, putting two on with two out in the ninth inning, to bring four-time All-Star Victor Martinez to the plate as the potential winning run.	Martinez grounded out on a 2-0 pitch to end it, validating the decision.	"Had to pick your poison," Washington said. "I didn't want to let Cabrera tie the game."	The defending AL champions improved to 9-1, maintaining the majors' top record and matching the best 10-game start in team history.	Michael Young and Mitch Moreland hit RBI doubles in the seventh inning -- giving Ogando enough support -- as Texas equaled the start of its 1989 club.	Ogando (2-0) gave up just two hits, walked one and struck out four over seven innings in his second start in the majors. The converted reliever had his outing cut short by fluid under a callus on his right index finger after pitching six scoreless innings last week with a developing blister on the same finger.	Does Ogando expect to make his next start?	"Of course," he said in Spanish.	Texas reliever Darren Oliver gave up a hit in the eighth. Feliz finished for his fourth save in as many chances after retiring two batters and allowing Ryan Raburn to double, bringing up Cabrera.	Verlander (1-1) lost despite pitching a six-hitter. He struck out four and walked one in his 119-pitch performance.	He was perfect until Josh Hamilton hit a two-out single in the fourth inning. Hamilton walked with one out in the seventh, scored on Young's double off the right-field wall and Moreland followed with a two-out double off the same wall to make it 2-0.	"[Verlander] was great," Young said. "He's always a handful."	Detroit had its best chance to score in the fourth when Cabrera became the second player younger than 28 to hit his 300th double, according to STATS LLC, but that didn't mean much to him after another defeat.	"We lost the game," Cabrera said.	His hit in the fourth put two on with one out, but Martinez's bloop to shallow left field turned into an inning-ending double play when shortstop Elvis Andrus caught the ball and the 27-year-old Cabrera couldn't beat the throw back to second base.	Tigers manager Jim Leyland planned to give slumping center fielder Austin Jackson the day off, but used him as a pinch-hitter in the eighth when Magglio Ordonez came out of the game with tightness in his right Achilles tendon. Ordonez missed games earlier this season with a stiff surgically repaired right ankle.	Leyland plans to sit him out at least a couple games.	"We're not going to go day to day and get him right," Leyland said.	Jackson hit a leadoff single, but was stranded after Oliver got Jhonny Peralta to foul out, Alex Avila to strike out and Brandon Inge to fly out.	Detroit fell to 3-7, needing victories in the next two games to win its first series in a season that started with relatively high hopes, after failing to make Washington's gamble backfire.	"That's the good thing about Wash -- he goes with what his gut says," Young said. "You've got two great hitters. Miguel's one of the best in the game and Victor has obviously had a very accomplished career.	"Fortunately, it worked out."	Game notes	 Texas pitchers have combined for two straight shutouts for the first time in nearly two years and have pitched 25 straight scoreless innings. ... The Rangers expect to use a by-committee approach on the mound in Wednesday's series finale. "It's going to be the bullpen," Washington said. "We just haven't decided how to do it yet." ... Joe Medwick had 305 doubles at the end of the 1938 season when he was 26 and had 48 more the following season before his 28th birthday. Since 1946, Albert Pujols (298), Robin Yount (289), Alex Rodriguez (276) and Vada Pinson (273) came close to the 300-doubles mark before turning 28, according to STATS LLC. ... Hamilton has a seven-game hitting streak.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

BOSTON --  The Tampa Bay Rays were certainly overdue for a big offensive game.	Sam Fuld went 4 for 6 with a two-run homer, drove in three runs and fell a single shy of the cycle to help the Rays bust out of an early-season slump with a 16-5 win over the Boston Red Sox on Monday night.	"That was nice to see," Rays manager Joe Maddon said. "Really consistent at-bats throughout the game. We attacked pitches, sprayed the ball all around the place."	Fuld, who grew up a self-described "big Red Sox fan" about an hour away in Durham, N.H., and Johnny Damon sparked the Rays' slumbering offense.	"We haven't had too many leads the whole season," Fuld said. "I think I had a little more adrenaline playing in a park I grew up going to."	Damon had three hits, including a solo homer, and three RBIs, and John Jaso and Reid Brignac also drove in three runs apiece for the Rays.	Losers in eight of its first nine games, Tampa Bay came in hitting a major-league worst .163 and had scored just 20 total runs, the fewest after nine games since the 2003 Detroit Tigers -- a team that finished 43-119.	Fuld doubled into the left-field corner in his last at-bat in the ninth.	Maddon said many players in the dugout teased him that they would have settled for a single.	"It shows his integrity there at the end of the game," he said. "He could have stopped at first base easily. Some guys in the dugout said they would have slid into first base."	Damon said, "At this stage of my career, if that happened, I'm stopping."	Jacoby Ellsbury hit a solo homer for the Red Sox.	Boston's loss came in Carl Crawford's first game against his former team. Crawford, who spent 12 years in the Rays' organization before leaving to sign a $142-million, 7-year contract with the Red Sox in December, went 2 for 5, raising his average to .163.	Jeremy Hellickson (1-1) gave up two runs, five hits, walked five and struck out one in 5 1/3 innings to earn the win.	The Rays, who led for just two innings all season, jumped ahead 1-0 on Damon's homer in the first and never trailed.	Damon, a key contributor to Boston's 2004 World Series title team that ended an 86-year championship drought, was greeted with the usual boos he's received since signing with the Yankees following the 2005 season. Before the noise subsided, he belted Daisuke Matsuzaka's first pitch into the Rays' bullpen for his second homer.	"We booed him when he got back to the dugout," Maddon joked.	It got a lot worse for Matsuzaka (0-2) in the second -- and the boos were much louder for him. Tampa Bay sent 10 batters to the plate, scoring six runs on three consecutive two-run hits after the right-hander loaded the bases with no outs. Jaso made it 3-0 with a two-run double, and Brignac drove in a pair with a single before Fuld hooked his two-run shot around the Peksy Pole in right.	"I've seen a lot of balls hit around that Pesky Pole on TV," said Fuld, who said he had about 30 people in the stands to watch him and went to "about 40 or 50 games" when he was a kid.	Matsuzaka threw 10 pitches in the first -- all strikes.	"There was one walk and seven balls hit right on the barrel," Red Sox manager Terry Francona said. "We love when guys throw strikes, but there were balls middle-middle for seven hitters."	Matsuzaka lasted just two-plus innings, giving up seven runs on eight hits.	"I was happy with him mixing the pitches up. We didn't just sit on one pitch. A couple of them were up over the plate that they were able to put some hits together," Red Sox catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia said of Matsuzaka's outing. "Another night he could do the same thing and they foul some off and they miss. We just have to erase this one."	Adrian Gonzalez's RBI triple cut it to 6-1 in the third.	The Rays added a run on Damon's RBI single in the fourth before David Ortiz tripled and scored on J.D. Drew's single in the bottom half.	Ortiz became the only AL player with at least one triple in each of the last 12 seasons.	Ben Zobrist's two-run double chased reliever Tim Wakefield and made it 12-2 in the sixth.	Game notes	 It was Matsuzaka's 100th career start. ... Francona said he'd like to become "somewhat consistent" with his lineup after switching fairly often during the team's initial eight games. ... Maddon said he hadn't heard from major league baseball after his ejection in Sunday's loss to the Chicago White Sox. He did say he saw highlights of it while he was at dinner Sunday night and said it looked like "an out of control manager" and found the video "somewhat humorous." ... Red Sox C Jason Varitek turned 39 Monday. ... Damon spoke to a large press gathering before the game. "Those four years coming here as a Yankee, there was definitely a little higher stress," he said. "I feel like I've been a pretty good ambassador to the game. I feel like I'm a pretty good person. A lot of people around these parts dislike me because I did play for the Yankees, that's part of it."	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

NEW YORK --  Troy Tulowitzki turned in a defensive gem one inning, then flashed his prodigious power the next.	Quite a display of all-around ability.	Nothing new, his Rockies teammates said.	Tulowitzki homered and drove in three runs, Carlos Gonzalez also had three RBIs and Colorado took advantage of a struggling New York Mets bullpen in a 7-6 victory Monday night.	"Every day these guys do something that you're just like, wow!" first baseman Ty Wigginton said. "They're definitely special and the Rockies have a lot of reasons to be excited about them."	A Gold Glove winner last year, Tulowitzki made a terrific jump throw from shortstop to preserve a seventh-inning tie.	Moments later, his eigth-inning homer gave the Rockies a three-run lead.	"I'm ashamed to say those things don't surprise me anymore because he does it every day -- and Carlos, too," Colorado pitcher Jason Hammel said. "They're two very big factors on this team."	Seth Smith reached base four times, including on a triple and a double. The Rockies improved to 7-2, with the only two losses coming in extra innings, to match the best nine-game start in franchise history.	Hammel pitched six respectable innings and Colorado took the opener of a four-game series, winning its third straight road game. The Rockies are 4-1 away from Coors Field after going 31-50 on the road last year.	The NL West leaders even found a way to win in New York. They are 5-23 on the road against the Mets since 2003, dropping eight consecutive series.	"Our history here is not very good," Hammel said. "It's nice to get one finally."	David Wright hit his second homer and Willie Harris had a two-run double for New York, which has lost four of five following a three-game winning streak. Jose Reyes tripled twice for the fifth time in his career and struggling starter Mike Pelfrey threw 113 pitches in 5 1/3 innings -- though he did leave with a 4-2 lead.	"Everybody is as frustrated in this room as I am, but we've been in every single game but one," Mets manager Terry Collins said. "The fight is still there, but we've got to stop making mistakes."	Trailing by three, the Mets mounted a rally in the eighth. Wright led off with a homer against Rafael Betancourt and Carlos Beltran doubled. A run-scoring single by Ike Davis cut it to 7-6, but Betancourt retired the next three batters.	"He did a good job recovering," Tulowitzki said.	Huston Street worked a perfect ninth for his fifth save in five chances. Matt Belisle (2-0) got the final two outs in the seventh, with some help from Tulowitzki.	Reyes tripled with two outs and Daniel Murphy hit a grounder toward the hole at shortstop. Tulowitzki fielded the ball on his backhand and jumped, twisting his body in the air to make a strong, accurate throw to first for the third out.	"It's weird. It just kind of happens when you've played this game for a long time," said Tulowitzki, who signed a contract in the offseason that guarantees the All-Star shortstop $157.75 million through 2020. "It's a big momentum shift and it definitely played a big part."	Wigginton had another description.	"Unbelievable," he said. "I was thinking as soon as he threw it I was going to have to dig it. That ball still had something on it. It wasn't like it just floated over there like you see a lot of guys. I mean, it was impressive."	Dexter Fowler singled off Bobby Parnell (0-1) to open the eighth and moved to third on a sacrifice and a wild pitch. Gonzalez hit a comebacker and Parnell had a good chance to get Fowler at the plate, but he threw over the head of catcher Josh Thole.	"I rushed it and I threw it to the backstop," Parnell said. "I knew Fowler was a good runner, so I tried to get rid of it as fast as I could and executed poorly."	Gonzalez was credited with an RBI on the fielder's choice and he went to second on the error. Tulowitzki followed with a loud shot to left for his fourth homer and a 7-4 lead.	"It wasn't a composure thing. I just made a bad pitch," Parnell said.	It was the second time in the game that a Mets reliever threw high to home plate on a key play.	Ryota Igarashi, just called up from Triple-A Buffalo, had a chance for an inning-ending double play in the sixth, but he made a wayward throw. Gonzalez followed with a two-run single, breaking his bat on a two-strike pitch, to tie it at 4.	Game notes	 Gonzalez was back in left field after not starting Sunday in Pittsburgh because of flulike symptoms. He threw out Angel Pagan trying to stretch a sixth-inning single. ... Wigginton started at 1B in place of Todd Helton, sidelined by a stiff lower back. Helton is 6-for-10 with a homer and four walks against Pelfrey, but manager Jim Tracy said Helton needed another day of rest even though he felt much better. Helton flied out with runners at the corners as a pinch hitter to end the seventh. ... Rockies ace Ubaldo Jimenez is slated to pitch an extended spring training game Wednesday in Arizona and then return to the Rockies' rotation next Monday. Jimenez is on the 15-day disabled list with a cut finger cuticle.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

HOUSTON --  Starlin Castro says he doesn't care where he bats in the lineup.	On Monday night, he certainly appeared to like the leadoff spot.	Castro, Darwin Barney and Marlon Byrd combined for seven hits, five runs and three RBIs and the Chicago Cubs held on for a 5-4 win over the Houston Astros.		Castro had three hits and scored three runs, Byrd drove in a pair of runs and Barney hit an RBI triple as the Cubs jumped on the Astros early, building a 5-0 lead by the fourth inning. Alfonso Soriano drove in two runs with a double in the first.	"I don't care what spot," Castro said. "First, second, I don't care."	Cubs manager Mike Quade is encouraged with how his young players Castro and Barney have started the season.	"The kids did really, really well," he said. "I liked watching them. It's fun to watch them. They feed off of each other, and they play with enthusiasm."	Closer Carlos Marmol got the last four outs for the Cubs, giving him four saves. Ryan Dempster (1-2) got his first win of the season, allowing four runs in 6 1/3 innings.	"I felt good tonight," Dempster said. "Ninety-five percent of the time I felt like I was hitting my spots and making pitches."	Houston starter Nelson Figueroa (0-2) allowed eight hits and five runs in four innings.	"We know he is much better than that," Houston manager Brad Mills said. "He was just having problems today getting the ball over the plate and getting behind guys. But we've seen him and we know that that's not him and we know that he's going to be just fine."	Houston's offense didn't get going until late. The Astros got a run in the fifth inning before a solo homer by Bill Hall and a two-run shot by Angel Sanchez pulled them to 5-4 in the seventh.	Marmol later struck out Sanchez to end the eighth and allowed a hit and a walk in the ninth before striking out Joe Inglett to end the game.	Hall hit the sixth pinch-hit homer of his career with a solo shot to right field that made it 5-2 in the seventh inning.	Bourn followed with a double that bounced off the low wall in right field and back onto the field. Officials reviewed the play to see if it was a home run, but stayed with the original call.	Quade defended his decision to leave Dempster in after the homer by Hall.	"Dempster gave me every reason to," he said. "He was rolling along, allowing just one run. I thought we could get him through it. I liked the matchup with him and Sanchez. He made the mistake. I just didn't want him to lose it. That's what I was committed to. He had pitched too well."	The Cubs got to Figueroa early when Soriano's two-out, two-run double gave them a 2-0 lead in the first inning. Figueroa gave up a single to Castro and walked two of the first five batters he faced to set up the scores.	Castro got his second hit of the game on a single with two outs in the second inning. He scored on a triple by Barney that made it 3-0. Byrd's RBI single pushed the lead to 4-0.	Castro singled again in the fourth inning and gave the Cubs their first stolen base of the season when he swiped second. Chicago was the only team in baseball without a stolen base entering Monday's game.	He scored on a single by Byrd later in the inning to stretch the lead to 5-0.	"I'm frustrated," Figueroa said. "I hate losing, first of all. I hate putting our team behind in a situation like this."	Carlos Lee singled in the second inning before Dempster walked Brett Wallace. He got out of that jam by retiring the next three batters to end the inning and sat down the next nine overall, striking out five. He didn't allow another hit until Chris Johnson's single with no outs in the fifth inning.	Matt Downs drove Johnson in with a single that made it 5-1.	An error by Ramirez and two walks by Dempster loaded the bases for the Astros in the sixth inning. Dempster got out of the jam when Inglett grounded out to end the inning.	Game notes	 Chicago OF Kosuke Fukudome was out of the lineup Monday after straining his hamstring making a catch the day before. He is listed as day to day with the injury and the Cubs are hoping he will recover with a couple of days rest. "It's a delicate area because if you push that envelope it could become six weeks instead of four or five days," Quade said. "He's too valuable to just send him down and bring somebody else up right now. If we can get through this for a few days without having to DL him that will be huge." ... Houston RHP Alberto Arias, who missed last season after shoulder surgery and had tendinitis during spring training, threw to hitters on Sunday and is scheduled to do it again on Tuesday.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CHICAGO --  In a rare matchup between perfect starting pitchers, it was a young reliever and a catcher that made the difference for the Oakland Athletics.	Catcher Kurt Suzuki homered on a 1-2 pitch from Jesse Crain with two outs in the 10th inning, giving Oakland a 2-1 win over the Chicago White Sox on Monday night.	"It's a big thrill," said Suzuki. "Any time you can get a hit when it really counts, it's an exciting time."	The pitching matchup between lefties Mark Buehrle and Dallas Braden marked the 21st time in major-league history opposing starting pitchers who have thrown a perfect game faced each other.	"I don't really ever let what the other guy is doing affect my game plan," said Braden. "I actually kind of like it, because you're back out there and back at your craft."	After managing just two singles and a walk in eight innings against Buehrle, the Athletics came alive when the lefty departed after throwing 99 pitches.	"Buehrle was so tough at that point that they could have brought in anybody and it would have been a little bit of a relief, just because he was so tough," said Athletics manager Bob Geren.	The White Sox wasted Buehrle's dominant performance with their second ninth-inning implosion of the season. Buehrle was lifted after eight scoreless innings and allowed only three baserunners -- none past first base.	Matt Thornton, who already had two blown saves in two opportunities, came on and allowed a leadoff double to Andy LaRoche in the ninth.	One out later, Daric Barton hit a deep fly that Juan Pierre dropped in the left-field corner, allowing pinch-runner Cliff Pennington to easily score from second and tie the game 1-1. Pierre also had a dropped fly in Friday's loss to the Rays, which helped Tampa Bay rally from three runs down in the ninth to win.	"Juan Pierre is a great player. He's made two mistakes behind me, I will never say anything bad about that guy, I want every fly ball I get to go to him. He's dedicated to this game more than anyone in baseball, I'll never say anything behind him or any of my teammates, they're great players, they're gold glovers and All-Stars," said Thornton.	In a game with such a small margin for error, the Athletics wouldn't have been in position for the win if not for the work of reliever Tyson Ross, who was called up on April 7. Ross didn't mind coming into the middle of a pitcher's duel.	"It was nice that it went by quick," said Ross. "There was a good pace to the game. I was able to watch the hitters a little bit and have a good idea of what they were doing up there."	Suzuki's go-ahead shot off Crain (0-1) barely made it over the wall in left.	"That was huge," said Geren. "He got on top of it really well. He hit it hard. My first thought was that he was going to catch it. He hit it hard enough, I just didn't know if it was going to be high enough."	Ross (1-0) pitched three scoreless innings and Brian Fuentes pitched a perfect 10th for his fourth save. Pierre, who was greeted by loud boos, grounded out to end it.	In his second start, Braden allowed one run on five hits. He struck out seven and walked two. He didn't allow a hit until an infield single by Alex Rios in the fourth inning.	"It was awesome, a good game all around," said Ross. "Two great pitchers, working both sides of the plate. You go back and look at the film. That's how you pitch."	Buehrle, who pitched a perfect game on July 23, 2009, against the Rays and a no-hitter April 18, 2007, against Texas, appeared to have no-hit stuff again. He retired the first 10 batters before walking Barton in the fourth. Buehrle quickly made up for it by getting Josh Willingham to ground back to him to start an inning-ending double play.	"It was one of those games that everything was working," said Buehrle. "Like I said, 33 starts, 11 of them you're going to have good stuff, 11 you're going to be so-so and 11 of them are going to be bad and today was one of the good ones," said Buehrle.	Oakland didn't get its first hit until Suzuki led off the sixth with a single.	"It was the same thing Buehrle always does," said Suzuki. "Changes pitches, throwing strikes. A lot of guys say he throws junk, but he's an aggressive strike thrower. He throws junk, but he throws it for strikes. That's what makes him so tough, he can throw everything for strikes."	Game notes	 Guillen still doesn't have a clear timetable when DH Adam Dunn is going to be back in the lineup. "When he tells me he's ready, I'm going to give him an extra day," said Guillen. Dunn has missed six straight games after undergoing emergency appendectomy surgery on Wednesday. ... RHP Jake Peavy is scheduled to throw 90 pitches in a rehab start on Wednesday. ... The last time two opposing perfect game winners faced was when Arizona's Randy Johnson faced San Diego's David Wells on April 24, 2007. Lillebridge's home run was the 10,000 in franchise history.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PHOENIX --  Kyle McClellan admitted that Chase Field has been a tough place for him to pitch in the past. Maybe as a reliever.	McClellan's first start in Arizona was a success, with the right-hander picking up his first major-league win as a starter and knocking in two runs with a pair of hits to help lead the St. Louis Cardinals to an 8-2 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Monday night.	"It's better than my first loss," McClellan said. "It just comes with doing your job."	Lance Berkman hit two home runs and Jon Jay added a pinch-hit homer for St. Louis.	They had to cover for first baseman Albert Pujols, whose early-season slump continued with a 1 for 5 night. Pujols' average dipped to .150 by the end of the game. He has just one multihit game through the first 10 games of his free agency year.	The Cardinals sent nine batters to the plate in the top of the fourth inning, scoring three runs with two outs. Skip Schumaker's double down the right-field line drove in Matt Holliday, then McClellan picked up his second career RBI with a single after a wild pitch advanced Schumaker and Yadier Molina to second and third.	"I got lucky a couple of times," McClellan said of his hitting.	"They hit a couple of ground balls when they put that string of four [hits] together and it worked against us," Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson said, noting that Arizona was 1 for 9 against McClellan with runners in scoring position. "That happens sometimes."	Ryan Theriot's single to right drove in Molina, and that was enough for McClellan (1-0), who made it through six innings allowing a run on seven hits with four walks and four strikeouts.	"Four walks isn't what you want," McClellan said, "but I made pitches when I needed to and I've got to work on trying to throw less pitches per inning. But you've got to go with what you've got that day."	McClellan drove in the game's first run with a double over the head of center fielder Chris Young in the third inning. The Diamondbacks were playing the pitcher shallow after he'd squared to bunt earlier in his first at-bat.	"He did it all," Cardinals manager Tony LaRussa said of McClellan. "More than anything else he elevated himself among the bench as far as pinch-hitters among the pitchers."	The Diamondbacks came back in their half of the fourth with a run off McClellan. Young doubled and came home two batters later on a single by Melvin Mora. Arizona had runners on first and second with one out in the fourth before starter Barry Enright (0-1) grounded into an inning-ending double play.	Enright lasted six innings and was charged with four runs on nine hits. Sam Demel came on in relief and gave up Berkman's solo home run in the seventh.	"I lose my aggressiveness sometimes," Enright said. "You get a few guys on base and you start trying to place the ball instead of going after people."	The Cardinals scored three more runs in the ninth off reliever Juan Gutierrez, on Berkman's two-run shot and Jay's solo drive over the right-field fence.	Game notes	 The Diamondbacks will make up their snowed-out April 3 game with Colorado on May 24 as part of a day-night doubleheader in Denver. ... Arizona Cardinals WR Larry Fitzgerald is scheduled to take batting practice with the Diamondbacks before Tuesday's game to prepare for his upcoming charity softball event. ... Cardinals manager Tony LaRussa called former big-league shortstop and current Diamondbacks bench coach Alan Trammell his "favorite player of all time," and openly lobbied for more Hall of Fame votes for Trammell, who has come up short 10 times. ... Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson isn't worried about low crowd turnouts even though the Diamondbacks are off to an encouraging start. "We owe it to ourselves and baseball and our organization and the fans that do show up to give it everything we have and don't give in to anything," Gibson said. After a crowd of 48,027 last Friday for the home opener, attendance has been no higher than 20,719 in the next three games.	Information from The Associated Press contributed to this report.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  If the Cleveland Indians keep winning at this rate, it's going to be difficult for them to sneak up on anyone.	Mitch Talbot took a shutout into the ninth inning and the Indians got home runs from Asdrubal Cabrera and Matt LaPorta to beat the Los Angeles Angels 4-0 Monday night for their eighth straight win.	"I don't think anybody expected us to come out like this" Talbot said, "But you look down this lineup and it's pretty good."	The winning streak is Cleveland's longest since a 10-game stretch in August 2008. The Indians, coming off a sweep at Seattle, have started out 4-0 on the road for the first time since 1998 (6-0). Their 8-2 start overall is their best since 2002, when they won 12 of their first 13.	"It helps to have a lead and have some margin for error," manager Manny Acta said. "That's something we didn't have very often here last year. But we have a better lineup this year and that helps everybody."	Talbot (1-0) came within three outs of his first big league shutout, allowing five hits and two walks while striking out four. He was lifted after Bobby Abreu led off the ninth with a double on Talbot's 112th pitch.	"My biggest thing was locating my fastball down in the zone," Talbot said. "It had a little bit of sink, a little bit of run, and I was getting ground balls. Most hitters are going to try to run your pitch count up, and maybe take a pitch here or there, so it always helps to get ahead. It's a pretty big accomplishment to stick around that long in the game."	The Angels were quite impressed by what they saw from Talbot. In his only other start against them, he gave up a run over 6 1/3 innings in 9-2 win at Anaheim on April 27, 2010.	"He was in a zone," said Angels right fielder Torii Hunter, who didn't get a ball out of the infield in four at-bats. "He had all his pitches working -- the two-seamer, the cutter, the changeup, and the slider. He threw everything at us but the kitchen sink. He had trust in his stuff and threw it at anytime for strikes. When he needed a ground ball and a big out, he got it done. We just couldn't get him up in the zone to get under the ball and get it to the outfield. We kept hitting it on the ground."	Vinnie Pestano retired the final three batters in order.	Angels starter Tyler Chatwood gave up four runs, four hits and four walks in five innings in his major league debut.	"I think I felt more anxious than nervous, but it was definitely exciting to get out there and just have the opportunity to pitch in Angel Stadium, finally," Talbot said. "There was a lot of adrenaline going through me. I felt confident the whole time and just tried to attack the zone and get ahead early in the count. I'm not satisfied with my outing because I didn't keep my team in the game and we lost. But I've just got to learn from it."	The 21-year-old right-hander was promoted from Triple-A Salt Lake when Dan Haren's scheduled start was pushed back a day. Haren had pitched an inning of relief to get the win in the Angels' 14-inning, 6-5 victory over Toronto on Saturday night. Chatwood was the organization's minor league pitcher of the year last season, and has just 6 2/3 innings of Triple-A experience.	"I thought he pitched really well, and to finish strong like that really says a lot about him," catcher Hank Conger said. "He just battled. I mean, he gave up those two home runs, but he just kept competing and kept attacking the hitters over the last three innings. He's soaked in a lot of experience, and it's only going to get better from here. I see a long career for him."	Cabrera, the Indians' No. 2 hitter, drove Chatwood's eighth pitch of the game over the center field fence on a 3-1 count and LaPorta added a three-run shot in the second. Chatwood walked the bases loaded in the fifth and went to 3-2 on Shin-Soo Choo before retiring him on an inning-ending double-play grounder to second base.	"He made good pitches when he had to with that breaking ball and that changeup," Acta said. "We probably could have gotten a few more runs, but he made a good pitch on Choo and got himself out of that inning. We thought that was an opportunity for us to break the game open. But he battled and you've got to give him credit."	Angels reliever Scott Downs was activated after opening the season on the 15-day disabled list because of a broken big toe on his left foot and made his Angels debut with a perfect eighth inning. The 35-year-old left-hander signed a three-year, $15 million contract as a free agent in December after spending his first six big league seasons with Toronto.	Game notes	 Cabrera has four homers, one more than he hit last season in 381 at-bats. He missed two months with a broken left forearm. ... Mark Langston threw a ceremonial first pitch on the 21st anniversary of his Angels debut, when he pitched seven innings of a combined no-hitter with Mike Witt against Seattle at the Big A against Seattle. ... The Indians' Class A Lake County club in the Midwest League got a combined no-hitter Monday night from Trey Haley, Francisco Jimenez and Clayton Elhert against Dayton.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

SEATTLE --  The few Mariners fans that hung around from the smallest crowd in Safeco Field history Monday night, saw one of the most improbable comebacks in recent team history.	Luis Rodriguez lined a two-run single with two outs in the ninth inning off Shawn Camp to cap Seattle's rally for an 8-7 win over the Toronto Blue Jays.	On a night reigning AL Cy Young Award winner Felix Hernandez was far from his best, his teammates came through with a remarkable rally to snap Seattle's seven-game losing streak. It was also the Mariners' first home win of the season and snapped a seven-game losing streak despite only 13,056 showing up for the game, the lowest attendance in the 12-year history of Safeco Field.	"We really broke through there in the eighth inning," manager Eric Wedge said. "(Michael) Saunders got the big hit to lead things off after that in the ninth. You can't say enough about that at-bat that Luis Rodriguez had. Nine of 10 pitches with the game on the line right there, fighting through it, fouling some pitches off and ultimately came through and you love to see that. It was a good win for us."	Seattle trailed 7-0 entering the seventh before the rally began, thanks largely to an eighth-inning meltdown by the Blue Jays bullpen.	Camp (0-1) played only a part in Toronto's bullpen collapse, but declined to speak to reporters after the game.	"A tough night on the mound," Blue Jays manager John Farrell said. "Anytime you walk 11 guys and still be in the game. Things obviously had to go right for us in the first part of it, but we simply lost the strike zone, to say the least."	Milton Bradley got things rolling with his first homer of the season, a solo shot in the seventh.	In the eighth, a walk and two singles chased Toronto reliever Davis Purcey and loaded the bases. Octavio Dotel walked in two runs and Mark Rzepczynski walked in another before allowing a single to Justin Smoak that scored two and pulled Seattle within one.	"It was a tough inning," Rzepczynski said. "For me personally, overall it was a tough inning. Camp should never have gotten out there, we should have got those guys out. It was one of those innings that every thing that could go wrong did go wrong."	But Miguel Olivo was unable to deliver again, grounding into an inning-ending double play as Toronto clung to a 7-6 lead.	Michael Saunders led off the ninth with a double down the right-field line and Brendan Ryan sacrificed him over to third. Ichiro Suzuki was intentionally walked and stole second to set up Rodriguez's moment.	Rodriguez arrived at spring training on a minor league contract, but earned a job on the major league roster. He fought off nine pitches from Camp before driving Camp's 10th pitch deep to right-center field and setting off a celebration for the few fans that remained.	"I had to swing at everything, anything close to the plate," Rodriguez said. "I got my pitch and hit it."	Rodriguez fought off nine pitches from Camp before delivering the game-winning single.	Josh Lueke (1-0) picked up his first career win.	Chone Figgins was handcuffed by a line drive from Jayson Nix that dribbled away and allowed Travis Snider to score and give the Blue Jays a 1-0 lead. The ball hit Figgins on the left thumb and he would leave the game in the fourth inning, being replaced by Luis Rodriguez. Figgins had X-rays, which came back negative. Wedge said it will probably be a day-to-day thing.	Jose Bautista singled on a ball deep in the hole at shortstop and beat out the throw by Brendan Ryan. After a strikeout by Adam Lind, Bautista was off and running on a hit and run and was caught in a rundown between first and second when Aaron Hill failed to make contact, but Ryan dropped the ball as Bautista slid safely into second.	Hill promptly doubled down the left field line to score Bautista. Hill then scored on a fielder's choice by Snider that gave the Blue Jays a three-run cushion.	Encarnacion led off with a single and Nix doubled to put runners on second and third with no out. A wild pitch scored Encarnacion from third and a sacrifice fly by Yunel Escobar scored Nix to give Toronto a 5-0 lead. Hernandez was done after the sixth after Corey Patterson added a two-run homer to make it 7-0.	Seattle had chances to score early, loading the bases twice in the first three innings. Olivo came to the plate with two outs both times and failed to get the hit to put Seattle on the board. Olivo stranded 10 runners, six in scoring position.	Game notes	 Mariners 2B Jack Wilson was back in the lineup after being benched the last three games. Wilson took himself out of the team's final game in Texas after committing two errors at second base and was sat down by Wedge. ... It was the first time Felix Hernandez had allowed 10 hits in a game since July 16, 2010, and first seven run outing since May 1, 2010. ... Patterson started in center field for OF Rajai Davis, who was placed on the 15-day DL before the game. ...	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Clayton Kershaw pitched with a Giants fan on his mind.	This was far from a routine night in the longtime rivalry between San Francisco and Kershaw's Los Angeles Dodgers.	Kershaw shut down the Giants again with his big-breaking curveball, Rod Barajas homered and the Dodgers beat San Francisco 6-1 on Monday night when players from both teams denounced violence between their hard-core supporters.	Kershaw (2-1) struck out seven, walked two and gave up six hits in 6 2/3 innings, and he hasn't allowed a run over his last 23 2/3 innings against the Giants. That includes seven scoreless innings on Opening Day and a complete game last Sept. 14 at AT&T Park.	But the Dodgers lost shortstop Rafael Furcal to a broken left thumb that likely will land him on the disabled list Tuesday.	This game was dedicated to longtime Giants fan Bryan Stow, who was severely beaten by two men in Los Angeles gear outside Dodger Stadium after the teams' March 31 season opener. Stow, 42, is at a Los Angeles hospital in critical condition and in a medically induced coma.	"Tonight was an emotional night with the Stow family and everybody's thoughts (with them)," Kershaw said. "It was a special night with both teams having a common goal in mind. I thought the fans were awesome."	It's was a rare sight before first pitch: players from both teams coming to the mound together to address fans. Giants reliever Jeremy Affeldt and Dodgers second baseman Jamey Carroll took turns providing a joint message to the sellout crowd of 40,870: This rivalry must stay on the field, without violence and hatred.	"This game is not about violence, it's about having fun," Dodgers center fielder Matt Kemp said after the game.	The Giants heightened security at AT&T Park in the wake of what happened -- as is standard practice when the Dodgers come to town anyway.	"I thought the fans were awesome," Kershaw said.	Andre Ethier had a pair of run-scoring singles and Kemp also added an RBI single in the Dodgers' four-run fifth against Madison Bumgarner (0-2), started by Barajas' drive to left-center for his second homer of the year.	Pat Burrell broke up Los Angeles' shutout bid with a solo homer against Mike MacDougal leading off the ninth that hit the left-field foul pole.	After a jam-packed weekend of World Series celebrations, the Giants presented former infielder Juan Uribe with his championship ring before the game. Then, the tone became far more serious.	Carroll delivered his message then had three hits in the Dodgers' third win in four tries against the reigning champions. Carroll also had three hits Saturday at San Diego after producing four three-hit games all of last season.	Los Angeles' top three hitters went a combined 6 for 11 with a walk over the first seven innings.	The first seven batters reached base against Bumgarner in the fifth. Furcal was hurt after being called safe on a close play at third base by Todd Tichenor, a call-up umpire from the minor leagues. It was Furcal's first stolen base but the injury wasn't clear because he stayed in the game for two more defensive innings before Aaron Miles pinch-hit in the seventh. The Dodgers made two outs on the bases in the fifth.	"It was me not being able to put guys away, get them out," Bumgarner said of the fifth. "It was a frustrating game. A lot of things didn't go my way."	Aubrey Huff had two hits for the Giants, who were coming off their first series victory of 2011 against St. Louis over the weekend. San Francisco lost two of three to open the season at Dodger Stadium, both by one run. The Giants have been held to one or fewer runs in four of their six losses.	"We need a better game plan for him. He's tough, no doubt about it," Burrell said of Kershaw. "He's one of the tougher guys out there."	Bumgarner, the 21-year-old lefty who shut out the Texas Rangers in Game 4 of the World Series as a rookie, was tagged for five runs on eight hits in five innings.	Last season, he went 6-3 with a 1.91 ERA in 10 outings away from the Giants' waterfront ballpark last season and 1/3 with a 4.60 ERA in eight starts at home.	The Dodgers won five championships since coming to California in 1958 before the Giants got their first in San Francisco last fall.	The last time these two rivals met with the Giants as champion was so long ago that the game featured Hall of Famer Willie Mays homering off Carl Erskine at Ebbets Field in New York's 7-5 loss to the Brooklyn Dodgers on Sept. 18, 1955.	Los Angeles third baseman Casey Blake, who started the season on the disabled list with a back injury, was out of the lineup for the second straight game after a Saturday collision with San Diego baserunner Chase Headley. Blake has soreness in his upper left thigh that worsened over night into Monday.	Game notes	 Kershaw lowered his ERA from 2.08 to 1.37. ... Kemp stole his seventh base for the Dodgers in the second inning after drawing a leadoff walk. ... The Giants plan to decide Tuesday whether injured CF Andres Torres, who strained his left Achilles' tendon Saturday night, will need a disabled list stint. They don't want to go short-handed for long. Miguel Tejada batted leadoff in Torres' usual spot Monday. ... Injured Giants RF Cody Ross has resumed jogging and outfield work as he recovers from a strained right calf that landed him on the DL to start the year. He gave a thumbs-up sign after the workout. Ross is slated to get some at-bats in extended spring training when the team heads to Arizona this weekend, then play in a couple of minor league games for a short rehab assignment. ... Bumgarner faced the Dodgers for the first time at home.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

DETROIT --  Now that Miguel Cabrera's back in Michigan with his teammates, he's performing just as they want him to on the field.	His spring training problems aren't forgotten, but his game-winning hit Tuesday was a reminder of why he's so important to the Detroit Tigers.	Cabrera's bases-loaded single in the bottom of the ninth gave the Tigers a 5-4 win over the Texas Rangers. Less than two months after being arrested in Florida on suspicion of drunken driving, he's off to a fine start hitting in the middle of Detroit's order.	"He does it every year. He comes to play. He's been working hard. He's in the weight room every day," teammate Brad Penny said. "He's a professional. When he comes in this clubhouse, he's a baseball player, and he handles himself how he should."	Cabrera, whose legal issues are still pending, is hitting .385 so far this season and leads the team with four home runs and 10 RBIs.	Brandon Inge led off with a single in the ninth off Darren O'Day (0-1) and moved to second on Alex Avila's sacrifice bunt. After two walks sandwiched around a strikeout, Cabrera ended the game with a single through the left side of the infield.	"You've got to focus for that and prepare and try and make a good swing, try to work the count," Cabrera said. "If you walk or something like that -- make something good happen."	Detroit led 4-3 before Texas tied it in the eighth with a run off reliever Joaquin Benoit. Jose Valverde (1-0) worked a scoreless top of the ninth for the Tigers.	Ryan Raburn had two hits for the Tigers and made a jumping catch against the left field wall. Detroit snapped a three-game losing streak and handed Texas its second loss of the season.	The Rangers were trying to start 10-1 for just the second time in franchise history. There was more bad news: Texas slugger Josh Hamilton left the game after his first at-bat with a strained right shoulder.	Hamilton had an MRI.	"I'm a little worried," said Hamilton, who was wearing a big black sling after the game. "The X-rays are fine -- there's no bone problem -- but I haven't heard back about the MRI yet. I usually bounce back pretty quickly from injuries, but the waiting for news isn't any fun."	The Rangers later announced that Hamilton was headed to the disabled list, set to miss six-to-eight weeks with a non-displaced fracture to his right arm just below the shoulder.	Detroit starter Penny rebounded from two unimpressive starts, allowing three runs on seven hits in 6 2/3 innings. Texas starter C.J. Wilson went 6 2/3 innings as well, allowing four runs on seven hits. He struck out four and walked three.	Hamilton left after the first inning. He slid headfirst into third when he hit a run-scoring triple, then tried to tag up on a foul popup near the Detroit dugout. Inge, the third baseman, and catcher Victor Martinez both ran after the ball, leaving the plate unprotected when Inge made the catch. But Martinez was able to take a throw from Inge while scampering back in time to tag out a diving Hamilton.	The Tigers scored in the bottom of the first -- the first run allowed by the Rangers in three games -- when Austin Jackson hit a leadoff triple and scored on Ramon Santiago's groundout. Michael Young gave Texas a 2-1 lead when he hit a sacrifice fly in the third that Raburn caught at the top of the fence, preventing further damage.	"I was just trying to get a good read on it," Raburn said. "I think the wind held it up more than anything. Luckily it found my glove."	The Tigers tied it in the bottom of the fourth on a sacrifice fly by Martinez, and Texas went back ahead on an RBI groundout by Adrian Beltre in the sixth. Raburn doubled home a run in the sixth and scored on Brennan Boesch's single to make it 4-3.	In the seventh, Detroit reliever Brayan Villarreal pitched a third of an inning -- without actually throwing a pitch. Villarreal came on with a man on first and two out. Before making a single delivery to the plate, he picked off Julio Borbon at first to end the threat. He was replaced by Benoit to start the eighth.	"I actually think that's what they wanted to happen. I think [manager Jim Leyland] pulled me out of the game so he could pick him off," Penny said. "That guy's got an unbelievable pickoff move."	Game notes	 Boesch was the only left-handed hitter in Detroit's starting lineup. Lefties hit .144 against Wilson last season. ... The Rangers have agreed to a contract extension with assistant general manager Thad Levine that runs through the 2015 season. ... Detroit OF Magglio Ordonez remains out -- he's been having problems with his surgically repaired right ankle. ... Texas manager Ron Washington said after the game RHP Dave Bush will start Wednesday.

WASHINGTON --  Jayson Werth tried hard not to show this performance against his old Philadelphia Phillies teammates meant anything special.	Werth homered and doubled to lead the Washington Nationals to a 7-4 win Tuesday night in his first appearance against Philadelphia since leaving as a free agent this winter.	When asked afterward about the significance of the game, at first he shrugged it off, calling it "business as usual." But a question about his home run led to a playful dig at his former manager, Philadelphia's Charlie Manuel.	"I was just trying to perform well for Charlie," Werth said with a smile. "He hasn't seen me play in a while."	Werth showed everyone he still has the offensive form that earned him a $126 million, seven-year contract with the Nationals this offseason after four years with Philadelphia. He doubled to lead off the fourth inning and later scored, starting a three-run inning that gave the Nationals the lead for good. His solo homer in the fifth gave Washington a 5-1 lead.	"Any time you hit a home run you're going to have some satisfaction," Werth said. "Was it extra special against those guys? Probably a little bit."	Phillies fans made up a large percentage of the sparse crowd at Nationals Park, and they booed Werth each time he came to bat -- or fielded a fly ball in right field.	Nationals closer Sean Burnett, sitting in Washington's right-field bullpen, heard those jeers clearly throughout the early innings.	"I haven't pulled so hard for a guy to hit a home run in my life," said Burnett, who pitched the final five outs for the save. "It was something the bullpen really wanted, because we had to listen to those fans out there."	Livan Hernandez (1-1) allowed one run on seven hits, struck out six and didn't walk a batter in 6 2/3 innings. He also picked up a sacrifice-bunt RBI as the Nationals won for the fourth time in five games.	"He just knows how to pitch," Phillies center fielder Shane Victorino said. "That's why he's been successful and why he's been doing it for so long."	Washington led 5-1 after five innings and 6-1 after seven, but Philadelphia didn't go down easily.	The Phillies loaded the bases with one out in both the seventh and eighth innings. In the seventh, Hernandez struck out pinch-hitter John Mayberry on a 62 mph curveball, and Clippard struck out Victorino to end the inning.	The Phillies were able to score two in the same scenario an inning later. Jimmy Rollins scored on a fielder's choice groundout by Raul Ibanez and Howard came home on a wild pitch by Burnett.	"It's the Phillies," Washington manager Jim Riggleman said. "You know they're going to battle you the whole way through. All night, it never felt like a widespread margin."	Philadelphia's Ryan Howard led off the second inning with a homer to left, his third of the season.	Joe Blanton (0-1) worked six innings, giving up five runs on seven hits for the Phillies. In two starts this season, Blanton has allowed 12 runs in 10 1/3 innings for a 10.45 ERA.	The Nationals tied the game 1-all in the bottom of the second on Danny Espinosa's sacrifice fly and then grabbed the lead in the fourth. Wilson Ramos doubled home Werth, and Washington loaded the bases on Laynce Nix's single and a walk to Espinosa. Jerry Hairston Jr. singled home Ramos, and Hernandez followed with a surprise bases-loaded sacrifice bunt to score Nix.	Washington increased the lead to 6-1 in the seventh when reliever Antonio Bastardo issued a bases-loaded walk to Ramos.	Game notes	 Washington put third baseman Ryan Zimmerman on the 15-day DL (strained abdominal muscle) and recalled catcher Jesus Flores from Triple-A Syracuse before the game. ... Nationals first baseman Adam LaRoche (groin) and outfielder Michael Morse (flu-like symptoms) were held out of the starting lineup. Morse pinch-hit in the seventh inning and finished the game at first base. ... Before the game, Werth chatted with his old teammates in the tunnel behind the Phillies' dugout, near the indoor practice batting cages. "He looked the same to me," Manuel said. "Looked wealthier. I told him he had heavier pockets." ... Bastardo's walk to Ramos in the seventh marked the first run allowed by the Phillies' bullpen after 20 straight scoreless innings. ... Burnett gave up an RBI single to Placido Polanco in the ninth, ending a 22 2/3 innings scoreless streak, the longest for any Nationals reliever since the team moved to Washington in 2005.

BOSTON --  David Price and Tampa Bay's rebuilt bullpen were too much for the Boston Red Sox.	These days, it seems every team is.	Price outpitched Jon Lester in a matchup of left-handed aces and the Rays broke a tie with the Red Sox for the worst record in baseball with a 3-2 win on Tuesday night. Boston fell to 2-9 while Houston, which began the day with an NL-worst 2-8 record, beat the Cubs 11-2.	"Both starting pitchers were very good," Tampa Bay manager Joe Maddon said. "I just love David's tenacity. I really do. This is a young man with great stuff, but tenacity to make him great. He just kept coming after them."	When he hit Kevin Youkilis with his 116th pitch of the night to put runners at first and second with two outs in the eighth, relievers Joel Peralta retired the next batter and Kyle Farnsworth pitched a perfect ninth inning for his second save of the season and 28th of his 14-year career.	In the offseason, the Rays lost almost their entire bullpen -- Joaquin Benoit, Rafael Soriano, Dan Wheeler, Grant Balfour, Randy Choate and Lance Cormier.	"Those guys shutting them down right there at the end, that's pretty good," Price said. "I feel comfortable with those guys going eight and nine, for sure."	Tampa Bay, which romped 16-5 on Monday night, can complete a series sweep Wednesday night.	Price (1-2) allowed five hits in 7 2/3 innings. He left with runners at first and second and Peralta ended the eighth by getting Jed Lowrie to fly out. Right-hander Farnsworth worked the ninth against three lefty pinch-hitters, striking out Jacoby Ellsbury and J.D. Drew and getting David Ortiz to fly to right.	"Down in the bullpen I knew they were sitting on the bench," Farnsworth said, "so you've got to get ready for them."	Lester (0-1) pitched well for his second straight outing but remained winless. He pitched seven shutout innings in his previous start, but the Cleveland Indians won 1-0 when Daniel Bard allowed a run on a suicide squeeze in the eighth.	"We were facing one of the better guys in the league tonight, just like they were," Boston manager Terry Francona said. "We didn't go into the game thinking we we're going to knock him around the ballpark."	What must the Red Sox do to turn their season around?	"We need a night like they had last night," Lester said. "We need a night where we show up and just pound the baseball and we do everything right. ... We're just not putting everything together. One night it's the pitching. One night it's the hitting. Some nights it's both. Nothing right now is clicking for us."	The Red Sox took a 1-0 lead in the third on Darnell McDonald's first homer of the season.	Tampa Bay scored three times in the fifth. Sam Fuld, who had two doubles, a triple and a homer the previous day, drove in the Rays' first run with a dribbler down the first base line.	The Rays had loaded the bases with one out on singles by Kelly Shoppach, Dan Johnson and Elliott Johnson. Fuld then hit the ball to first baseman Adrian Gonzalez, who charged it and threw to catcher Jason Varitek for an attempted forceout. But umpire Jeff Nelson ruled that Shoppach had slid in safely before the catch.	Johnny Damon followed with a two-run double before B.J. Upton grounded into an inning-ending double play.	Boston began the season as a popular choice to win the World Series after adding Gonzalez in a trade with San Diego and signing Carl Crawford as a free agent from Tampa Bay. Crawford has struggled all season and Gonzalez went 0 for 4 in this latest loss.	The Red Sox had been outhomered 21-5 this season before McDonald's long drive to left.	Boston scored once in the sixth and left the potential tying run on at second base. Dustin Pedroia led off with a double, took third on Gonzalez's groundout -- it was a hard liner that caromed off Price's upper thigh -- and scored on Lowrie's second double of the game, making it 3-2. But Mike Cameron was retired on a hard grounder to third baseman Felipe Lopez.	Price retired the side in order in the seventh and got Crawford to fly out to start the eighth. Pedroia walked and took second on Gonzalez's groundout before Kevin Youkilis was hit by Price's last pitch of the game. Lowrie, who had been Boston's most productive hitter during the game, flied out to Upton in center.	Game notes	 Crawford, who spent the past nine seasons with the Rays, received his 2010 Gold Glove and Silver Slugger awards before the game. "I'm glad we're in town to see it because he did it as a Ray and that's pretty significant," Tampa Bay manager Joe Maddon said. ... Lester is 3-7 with a 4.58 in his career in April and May and 58-19 with a 3.37 ERA after that. ... The game was the first between two teams that were 2-8 or worse through 10 games since April 30, 1918, when the Brooklyn Robins beat the Boston Braves at Ebbets Field.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

ATLANTA --  The Atlanta Braves did it all. Pitched well. Went deep. Manufactured runs. Played some brilliant defense.	Tommy Hanson pitched four-hit ball over seven innings for his first win, Jason Heyward and Brian McCann homered and Chipper Jones drove in two runs to lead the Braves past the Florida Marlins 5-0 on Tuesday night.	Hanson (1-2) finally got a few runs to work with and the Braves turned in several nifty defensive plays, two of them diving stops by shortstop Alex Gonzalez.	"We did a little bit of everything," Jones said. "Tonight was as perfect a nine-inning game as we've played yet. It's a good formula. Hopefully we'll see a lot more of it."	The Braves has struggled offensively over their first 10 games, scoring three runs or fewer seven times -- including both of Hanson's starts. This time, that wasn't a problem. Heyward homered in the fourth, McCann in the fifth.	There just weren't many people there to see it. The announced crowd of 13,856 was the smallest in Turner Field history.	On a cool, breezy night, Hanson used his changeup often and effectively, mixed in with a slider and curve.	"It was one of those days when everything worked," the big right-hander said.	Not for Chris Volstad (0-1), who was chased in the fifth, having allowed eight hits and all five runs. And, unlike Hanson, he didn't have any runs to work with.	The Marlins went 0-for-9 with runners in scoring position and hit into a pair of double plays.	"We've been struggling pretty much all season with runners in scoring position and today wasn't any different," manager Edwin Rodriguez said. "Hanson was making his pitches with runners in scoring position."	Volstad breezed through the first two innings before Atlanta broke through in the third after the first two hitters struck out. Martin Prado lined a single and Nate McLouth followed with a double to the gap in right-center, Prado coming all the way around to score. Jones followed with another two-out hit, going the other way to left to make it 2-0.	Heyward made it 3-0 in the fourth, hitting a towering drive over the 400-foot sign in center field for his third homer of the season.	The Braves finished off Volstad in the fifth. One run was a lesson in small ball. The other was pure power.	Prado led off with a double, McLouth sacrificed him to third, setting up Jones to finish the job with a sacrifice fly. McCann came up next and got a more immediate result -- a drive into the Braves' right-field bullpen for his first homer of the season. That was it for the Marlins starter.	"It was nice to see our lineup score some runs," said Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez, who managed the Marlins for 3½ years before he was fired last summer. "I know what they're capable of. Hopefully we can get on a roll."	Gonzalez said it was no big deal to be facing the team he used to manage for the first time.	"Nope. Just a baseball game," he said.	Hanson and the relievers got plenty of defensive help, too.	In the sixth, Hanley Ramirez hit a wicked two-hopper that appeared headed for left field, but Alex Gonzalez flopped down to make a backhanded grab. His throw to first skipped in the dirt, but Freddie Freeman dug it out so the defensive gem didn't go wasted.	"Wow," Hanson said on the mound.	The Braves weren't done. The next inning, McLouth raced to deep center to haul in a drive by Logan Morrison before planting his face into the padded wall. Again, Hanson saluted the effort, raising his hand toward McLouth, who replied with a tip of his cap.	Hanson gave way to the bullpen in the eighth but, fortunately for the Braves, Gonzalez was still at short. He came up with another diving stop in the hole, rolling over in time to get a force at second that prevented at least one run from scoring.	"Gonzo was unbelievable defensively," his manager said. "I think he was just showing off at the end."	Three relievers finished up the combined five-hitter.	Game notes	 Rodriguez said he's got no hard feelings after a wild game last Sunday in Houston but has no doubt that Astros reliever Aneury Rodriguez intentionally hit Gaby Sanchez with a pitch. The reliever and Houston manager Brad Mills were both ejected and received suspensions, the pitcher for three games and Mills for one. "On our part, it's done," Edwin Rodriguez said. "Hopefully, they've turned the page, too." ... Braves right-hander Jair Jurrjens will make his first start Saturday against the New York Mets. He strained his right oblique near the end of spring training and skipped over in the rotation a couple times to give him adequate time to recover. ... For the first time since Opening Day, Ramirez and Mike Stanton were both in the Florida lineup. They have been plagued by injuries over the first two weeks of the season.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

HOUSTON --  Angel Sanchez hit his first career home run on Monday and tied a career high by driving in four runs on Tuesday night.	Now the Houston Astros are wondering what Wednesday will bring for the hot-hitting Sanchez.	"I don't know, anything, but hopefully we win the game tomorrow," Sanchez said.	Sanchez backed up Brett Myers as he kept up his dominance against the Chicago Cubs to help the Houston Astros to an 11-2 win.	Myers (1-0) limited the Cubs to eight hits and one run in seven innings to improve his career record against Chicago to 11-3.	"I didn't feel like my location was too good tonight, but I was able to work around falling behind a lot of guys," he said.	Houston scored three runs off Cubs starter James Russell (1-1) in the first inning, two more in the second and built a 7-0 lead after Sanchez knocked in two runs with a single in the fourth inning.	Sanchez has five hits in his past seven at-bats and is hitting .526 with five RBIs in his past four games.	"He's more aggressive," bench coach Al Pedrique said. "He has more confidence at the plate right now and he's getting good pitches to hit. When you're hitting second and you've got Michael Bourn in front of you, obviously he's taking advantage of that situation that he's getting a lot of fastballs."	Russell was making his first career start after 59 relief appearances as a replacement for the injured Andrew Cashner. Russell allowed seven hits and five runs in 1 2/3 innings.	"I feel great and confident in my stuff," Russell said. "It's just one of those things that it didn't go my way."	Pedrique managed the game for Houston with manager Brad Mills serving a one-game suspension for his weekend ejection against the Marlins.	Jeff Fulchino pitched a scoreless eighth for Houston before Aneury Rodriguez allowed one run in the ninth. Rodriguez was given a three-game suspension for his ejection that led to the ejection of Mills. But he is allowed to play while appealing his suspension.	Hunter Pence had four RBIs and Bourn scored a career-high four runs to combine with Sanchez for an outstanding punch at the top of Houston's lineup. Humberto Quintero tied a career high with three hits and fell a home run shy of the cycle.	"Bourn and Sanchez are doing an outstanding job," Pence said. "It feels like every at-bat I've got runners everywhere. It feels good. When they're doing that the offense is coming around and that's a good ball game when they're doing that."	Tyler Colvin had a solo homer to right field that made it 7-1 in the seventh inning. Marlon Byrd went 3 for 3 with a double for the Cubs. He also robbed Bill Hall of a hit with a nifty leaping catch just in front of the bullpen in right field in the fifth inning.	The Astros hit three straight singles to start the first inning capped by Pence's run-scoring one that made it 1-0. Hall singled and Alfonso Soriano was charged with an error when he couldn't handle the catch, allowing two runs to score and push Houston's lead to 3-0. Hall was involved in a rundown between first and second base on the play, but evaded Darwin Barney to reach second and give Barney an error.	Quintero doubled before a single by Myers in the second inning. Bourn grounded into a force out to score Quintero and make it 4-0. The speedy center fielder then stole second and third base before scoring on a single by Pence that made it 5-0.	Sanchez had a two-RBI single in the fourth inning to extend Houston's lead to 7-0.	Pence drove in two runs with a double in Houston's four-run eighth inning to make it 11-1.	Houston's Chris Johnson committed his fourth error of the season when he missed a foul ball hit by Carlos Pena with one out in the eighth inning.	Jeff Samardzija, who was the second of five pitchers used by the Cubs, allowed three hits and two runs in three innings.	Cubs manager Mike Quade hasn't decided yet if Russell will get another chance to start.	"We've got a week before we need a pitcher, so we got some time," he said. "To me one disappointing outing doesn't mean we are going to scrap this thing."	Game notes	 Chicago OF Kosuke Fukudome was out of the lineup for the second straight day on Tuesday after straining his hamstring making a catch on Sunday. He is listed as day to day with the injury and the Cubs are hoping he will be able to play by Friday. ... Chicago signed veteran pitcher Doug Davis to a minor league deal on Tuesday. Davis went 1-4 in eight starts for Milwaukee last season, but missed most of the year with injuries. Cubs general manager Jim Hendry said Davis will be in extended spring training for a couple of weeks and they hope to have him at Triple-A Iowa before the end of the month.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CHICAGO --  Alexei Ramirez did enough at the plate to help a Chicago White Sox team struggling with its defense lately.	Ramirez hit his second homer of the game with two outs in the 10th inning to lift the White Sox to a 6-5 win over the Athletics on Tuesday night. Ramirez's blast came one night after Oakland beat Chicago 2-1 in 10 innings on Kurt Suzuki's extra-inning home run.	"We needed this win bad," said White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen. "After the loss last night, we bounced back and played a great game."	Ramirez also hit a three-run shot in the second inning and scored a run after drawing a walk in the sixth.	"I feel really happy with the work I did," Ramirez said through an interpreter. "I'm especially happy that we won the game."	Ramirez's offensive heroics helped offset his third error of the season, a bobbled grounder in the fifth.	"Of course, I'm really upset with myself for making that error, but you think about what you did, correct it, and concentrate more with the bat, which is what I did," said Ramirez.	Alex Rios dropped a flyball for an error in the sixth for Chicago's second error of the night. The White Sox have now committed 12 errors in 11 games this season.	"We're not playing good defense right now," said Guillen.	The defensive woes led to fans at U.S. Cellular Field to offer up a Bronx cheer whenever a White Sox outfielder made a catch, a practice Guillen didn't appreciate.	"If fans are gonna boo, I don't think that's fair," said Guillen. "You don't want to kick a guy when he's down. You want to support him."	Chicago reliever Chris Sale (2-0) picked up the win with two shutout innings. Sergio Santos threw two perfect innings in relief, striking out three of the six batters he faced.	"Everyone has the same mindset," said Sale. "Whenever you get the ball, go out there and do the best you can. My main focus is throwing strikes and get outs."	After seeing his bullpen blow Monday's game, Guillen was pleased with the performance of his relievers.	"The bullpen did a great job," said Guillen. "The way Santos and Sale threw was the key."	Daric Barton had four hits and scored a run, and Kevin Kouzmanoff hit a two-run homer for Oakland. Hideki Matsui, who entered the game hitting .182, had three hits, including a double, and drove in two runs.	Bobby Cramer (0-1) took the loss for Oakland, which came in having won four of its last five despite scoring a total of just 11 runs. Five runs was an improvement, but the Athletics continued their string of close games. Oakland's last eight games have been decided by a total of 10 runs.	"It was encouraging to see the way we swung the bat," said Oakland manager Bob Geren. "Matsui looked great, Barton had a heck of a night. All around it looks like the offense is getting it going, waking up a little bit, whatever phrase you want to use. Got to be happy about that."	Adam Dunn made his return to the Chicago lineup after missing the last six games because of an emergency appendectomy April 6. He went 1 for 4 and drew a walk in five plate appearances.	Oakland righty Trevor Cahill escaped the first inning without a run scoring despite allowing a single, a walk and throwing two wild pitches. He wasn't as fortunate in the second.	Ramirez hammered his second homer of the season on a hanging breaking pitch to put the White Sox up 3-1. Chicago added another run in the inning on Paul Konerko's grounder, but Cahill settled down after that, retiring six batters in a row.	He ran into more trouble in the fifth. Dunn hit a leadoff single before a two-out error by shortstop Andy LaRoche put two runners on with two outs.	Cahill threw 4 2/3 innings, allowing six hits, four runs, walking three and striking out three.	"My bullpen before the game went unusually better than I expected," said Cahill. "Usually I'm pretty bad in the bullpen, but today I was pretty good. I knew I was going to be struggling after that."	Jackson couldn't make it out of the fifth, costing him a chance at his third win in three starts even though he departed with the lead.	"No starter is going to be happy going 4 2/3 innings," said Jackson. "You're not helping the bullpen out. You want to be out there for as long as you can. It's just one of those things you shake off and get ready for the next one."	Game notes	 SS Cliff Pennington was unavailable for the Athletics because of what Geren called "a little infection of his sweat gland." Geren said his availability is day-to-day. ... Geren said Athletics reliever Michael Wuertz (hamstring) will likely throw a simulated game on Thursday, followed by a start in a minor-league rehab game on Saturday. ... White Sox OF Lastings Milledge cleared waivers on Tuesday and accepted an assignment to the club's Triple-A affiliate in Charlotte. ... LaRoche's throwing error in the fifth snapped Oakland's streak of six-plus games without an error. The Athletics committed an Oakland-record nine errors in their first four games.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

MINNEAPOLIS --  The Minnesota Twins lost four key relievers to free agency from last year's division champions, guys that got almost $40 million in guaranteed money between them in contracts with their new teams.	So far, those fan fears have been allayed. The remade bullpen is all right.	After a 12-up, 12-down performance by the 'pen, Danny Valencia hit a bases-loaded single with one out in the 10th inning to lift the Twins to a 4-3 victory over the Kansas City Royals on Tuesday night.	Dusty Hughes (1-0) pitched a perfect 10th for the victory and watched former teammate Robinson Tejeda (0-1) fail the Royals.	"That's baseball," Tejeda said. "I just try to come in and do my job. Sometimes you miss a spot, and they're going to make you pay for it."	He gave up a one-out single to Delmon Young and walked Michael Cuddyer. Then came Jason Kubel, who crushed a pitch to right-center where Jeff Francoeur nearly made a nifty running catch with his glove outstretched and his body bent awkwardly at the wall. Francoeur dropped it, though, sticking Kubel with a really long single and a disbelieving look to load the bases for Valencia.	"I don't care how far you have to go. Once it's in my glove, it's in my glove. That's what was frustrating for me," Francoeur said.	Brian Duensing was the biggest beneficiary of the big boost from the Minnesota bullpen. The left-hander was in a groove after a two-run fourth by the Royals, until his defense -- literally his own -- let him down.	Alcides Escobar reached on an infield single when Valencia's on-the-run off-balance throw needed to be perfect for the out, but it was wide left.	Then Duensing picked up Chris Getz's sacrifice bunt back to the mound and tossed it two feet over the head of Hughes with the second baseman covering the bag, an egregious error that put two runners in scoring position and set up Melky Cabrera's sharp tying single that glanced off Duensing's right shin.	Duensing shook off the pain, but that was his last batter. Jose Mijares struck out Alex Gordon, and Matt Capps got Butler to pop out to second and retired Francoeur on a called strike three on the inside corner. Francoeur disagreed with home plate umpire Alfonso Marquez, and Duensing clapped his hands and cheered for Capps with a clenched jaw from the dugout.	"I was really upset with myself because of the air-mail," Duensing said, adding: "I put the team in a situation that could've cost us the ballgame and for Mijares and Capps to come in and shut the door like they did, it does nothing but fire you up. They came in and covered me a little bit. I guess that's what they're supposed to do."	Capps pitched a perfect eighth inning, and Joe Nathan worked a perfect ninth. Former Royals right-hander Hughes went 1-2-3 in the 10th, including a diving catch of Gordon's leadoff line drive.	"The sky's the limit. You look at the back end of it: We've got two closers. Not many teams can say that," Hughes said.	Said Capps: "Then again we're talking about a small sample size. There's a lot of season left to be played. It was a nice win today, and hopefully this is what we're all about."	The Twins led the majors in first-inning runs last season, but they haven't scored yet in the first or the second in 2011. They came in with the second-worst team batting average in the league, too, including an AL-worst 24 runs and just three homers in nine games. The Royals, whose entire payroll is merely $13 million more than Joe Mauer's salary this season, rolled in with the second-best batting average.	Cuddyer lifted his batting average 112 points with singles in each of his first four at-bats, and he scored on a two-run single by Luke Hughes in the fourth that put the Twins up 3-2.	Mauer avoided the dreaded 4-6-3 double play with a well-hit sacrifice fly with runners at the corners and one out, but the Twins again were missing the clutch, extra-base hits the well-paid veterans in their lineup are being counted on to produce.	With runners at the corners and two outs in the ninth, following a leadoff walk by Valencia, Mauer flied out to center to end the inning. But then Valencia, the second-year third baseman, came through in the 10th.	Game notes	 The Twins are 38-17 against the Royals since the start of 2008. ... The announced crowd was 38,154, short of the official capacity of 39,500 and ending Target Field's sellout streak at 81 straight games. ... Royals starter Jeff Francis was stuck with his third straight no-decision. Francis has given up just six runs in his first 20 2/3 innings for the Royals, and he got 12 outs over his last 13 batters.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PHOENIX -- Whatever Kirk Gibson said to plate umpire Bob	Davidson in the third inning Tuesday night didn't matter nearly as	much as what his action meant to his players.	The Arizona manager was ejected for arguing with Davidson,	presumably about two close swinging strike calls that went against	Miguel Montero. The Diamondbacks seemed to feed off Gibson's fire,	getting three-run homers from Justin Upton and Juan Miranda to	power past the St. Louis Cardinals 13-8.	"It felt great to get some support from him," said Montero,	who had two of Arizona's 14 hits. "It feels even better when he	got thrown out of the game."	"It fired me up .. it gave some good enthusiasm to the team,	and we keep rockin', man," he said.	The Diamondbacks rocked Cardinals starter Chris Carpenter, who	was 4-0 in 10 previous career starts against them. Carpenter (0-2)	gave up at least a run in each of his four innings and exited	having allowed eight runs on eight hits.	"I didn't make a ton of great pitches, but even the ones that I	did they hit," Carpenter said. "I was making good pitches but	they were getting hits. Then you spin one into Upton and he hits it	500 feet. That's the way it works. I made some good pitches, I made	some bad ones."	Upton's home run in the second inning was measured at 478 feet,	believed to be the longest hit in the majors this season. Chris	Young added a two-run homer for Arizona, which scored seven of its	runs with two outs.	Armando Galarraga (2-0) allowed five runs on nine hits in five	innings to earn the win. He labored the most in the fifth, allowing	two runs before escaping a bases-loaded jam.	"It was not a good day for pitching," Galarraga said. "I'm	not really happy with my outing but I got the win."	Lance Berkman, David Freese and Colby Rasmus had solo home runs	for the Cardinals, who cut the lead to 9-8 on RBI singles by	Berkman and Freese off reliever Kam Mickolio in the sixth. The	Diamondbacks responded with four runs in the bottom half, including	Miranda's pinch-hit homer.	Cardinals star Albert Pujols went 3 for 5 to raise his batting	average to .200.	Gibson was ejected for the first time in his managerial career.	As the crowd roared, he went face-to-face with Davidson on the	field and from the dugout after being tossed from the game.	"We disagreed, obviously. I'm not going to get into what was	said or why. I think it's fairly obvious," Gibson said. "I just	did what I had to do."	Relievers Brian Tallet and Bryan Augenstein, who allowed a	combined five runs and five hits in 2 2-3 innings, both sustained	injuries are likely headed to the disabled list.	Tallet suffered what the club called a significant injury to his right (non-throwing) wrist. He was hurt getting the final out of	the fifth, diving to first base and colliding with the	Diamondbacks' Stephen Drew. Tallet is being sent back to St. Louis	for more tests.	Augenstein fell to the ground after delivering a pitch in the	seventh inning and had to be helped off the field with a right	groin strain.	Game notes	 The Cardinals started the game with the same batting	order (one through eight) on consecutive days for the first time	this season. ... Gibson said INF Geoff Blum, who is on the 15-day	DL with a right knee injury, has been running and could play in	extended spring training games soon. ... The wife of OF Gerardo	Parra gave birth to the couple's first child, son Gerardo, Monday	night. Parra was back in the Arizona lineup Tuesday. ... Wide	receiver Larry Fitzgerald of the NFL's Arizona Cardinals took	batting practice before Tuesday's game and struggled to make solid	contact with the ball. After saying he wouldn't try baseball if the	NFL lockout continues to drag out, he said that resolving the labor	issue is "up to the shirts and ties now to get it done," and that	he would love to be back on the football field.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Fresh off his first relief appearance since the 2004 World Series, Dan Haren showed the Cleveland Indians why he's been such a successful starting pitcher in the major leagues. And he did it with his most dominant performance.	The three-time All-Star pitched his first career one-hitter, allowing only Shin-Soo Choo's clean single in the fourth inning, and the Los Angeles Angels snapped the Indians' eight-game winning streak with a 2-0 victory on Tuesday night.	"I was going at them pretty much the whole night," Haren said. "I was pitching with a controlled aggressiveness. It was such a close game, I didn't want to leave anything out over the plate -- but I didn't want to get burned with walks, either."	Haren's third start of the season, which required him to throw 125 pitches, was pushed back a day after he threw 13 pitches in a perfect 14th inning on Saturday night against Toronto and got credit for the Angels' 6-5 victory. That relief appearance ended his string of 203 consecutive starts.	"He just told me he's ready for the 'pen on Friday if we need him," manager Mike Scioscia said with a grin. "But hopefully, we're past those days."	Haren (3-0) struck out eight and walked two in his third shutout and 12th complete game in 225 starts. Choo's single to center field came with one out in the fourth.	"What was special about tonight was that he pitched with his back against the wall the whole night," Scioscia said. "There wasn't any margin for error. They have some guys on that team who can really drive the ball, but Dan made some terrific pitches to keep those guys down all night."	Haren and Jered Weaver have combined for all six of the Angels' wins through the team's first 11 games and have a cumulative 0.79 ERA. Haren is 7-0 with a 1.41 ERA over his last 11 starts.	"It was going to have to take a well-pitched game, and a guy like Haren to beat us," Cleveland manager Manny Acta said. "Haren was on his game. He was in complete command from inning one. He's one of the best pitchers in the game. He's a No.1 guy on a staff, and those guys are fortunate to have two of them."	Haren was never in trouble and helped himself defensively. After Orlando Cabrera reached on an error by Angels third baseman Alberto Callaspo, he was caught stealing when he took a big lead and broke for second before Haren went into his motion.	The Indians' winning streak was their longest since a 10-game string in August 2008. Cleveland is off to a surprising 8-3 start despite the defeat.	"That's baseball. Sometimes you're going to run into a guy who has a performance like that," Indians designated hitter Travis Hafner said after going 0 for 3 with a strikeout. "He was throwing four pitches and locating all of them and changing speeds. He was throwing a lot of off-speed stuff for strikes, and nothing was really in the middle of the plate."	Peter Bourjos and Mark Trumbo homered for the Angels off Fausto Carmona (0-2), who gave up four hits in 7 2/3 innings. The right-hander struck out six and walked three.	"Fausto threw the ball great tonight," Hafner said. "It's good to see. That's two really good outings in a row for him, so it looks like he's back on track and he should have a great season."	After giving up a leadoff single to his first batter, Carmona allowed only one other ball to be hit out of the infield through the fifth inning -- a leadoff homer in the third by Bourjos that landed in the lower seats in the left-field corner.	In the seventh, Trumbo hit a drive just inside the left-field pole for his first big league home run. All but one of the Angels' 14 homers this season have come with the bases empty.	"This guy does not give up home runs," Scioscia said of Carmona. "He's got a heavy sinker. And if he's getting the ball down, it's tough to dig out. But he got one up to Peter, and Mark dug one out and just hooked it down the left field line. It was good to see the bottom third of the lineup do something tonight."	Angels left fielder Vernon Wells, acquired in a trade from Toronto in January, got the day off after going 4 for 44 over his first 10 games with his new club. Scioscia kept him out of the lineup to give him a chance to "let a little air out." Over the previous five seasons with the Blue Jays, the 13-year veteran and three-time All-Star had a cumulative average of .332 in his first 10 games.	"I think every hitter has had rough spots. I mean, there have been 4-for-40s in a lot of players' history," Scioscia said. "When you're with a new team and the first stats that are out there are naked like that, there's going to be a lot of attention on it. But I don't think it's because of the fact that he's with a new team. He hasn't tried to bring an `I'm-gonna-show-you-guys-what-I-can-do' attitude.	"The reality of it is that he's just trying to find some timing," Scioscia added. "He's a little bit off, as far as his balance ... But he'll find it. There's no doubt about it. But he wants to contribute now, absolutely, and I think that leads to a little bit of frustration. But he's confident in his talent and we are, too."	Game notes	 A ceremonial first pitch was thrown by Jim Fregosi, a six-time All-Star shortstop with the Angels who managed the team to its first AL West title in 1979. ... The Angels recalled OF Reggie Willits from Triple-A Salt Lake and optioned OF Chris Pettit to their Pacific Coast League club. ... Hafner is batting .201 with eight homers, 29 RBIs and 52 strikeouts in 47 games against the Angels since hitting a career-high three homers against them on July 20, 2004 at Anaheim.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

SAN DIEGO --  The Cincinnati Reds had to make so many plays late in game to stay in it, that manager Dusty Baker was left shaking his head.	Ryan Hanigan hit a go-ahead double and Drew Stubbs launched a three-run homer that capped a six-run burst in the 11th inning Tuesday night and led the Reds over the San Diego Padres 8-2.	But the Reds also needed clutch defensive plays from outfielders Jay Bruce and Jonny Gomes to salvage the game and continue it for their late hitting heroics.	"There were so many plays out there," said Baker. "And they all counted. Oh boy."	The Padres nearly won in the ninth when Cameron Maybin hit a drive with two outs and the bases loaded. Maybin put up his hands to celebrate, but Bruce ran down his drive into the right-center field gap.	San Diego also had the bases loaded with one out in the 10th but failed to score when Logan Ondrusek (2-0) struck out Chase Headley. Gomes then had to go back on Ryan Ludwick's fly ball after initially breaking in to snare it and end the inning.	"We didn't get the hit when we needed to and they did," San Diego manager Bud Black said. "In a close game, everyone wants to be the guy."	Hanigan's double into the left-field corner off Cory Luebke (0-1) scored Gomes, who was running on the 3-2 pitch from first base. After pinch-hitter Chris Heisey and Edgar Renteria had RBI singles, Stubbs homered.	"That's a huge win, those one-run games," Hanigan said. "I feel like the bullpen really stepped up and really stepped up and made quality pitches, we played great defense."	Ondrusek worked out of both of the bases-loaded jams in the ninth and 10th innings. Ondrusek, who was 5-0 last season as a rookie, became the first Reds pitcher to start his career 7-0 since 1986-87.	"I was having a tough time at the plate up until then," Hanigan said of his 11th inning at-bat. "I was just trying to battle and I got a pitch I could handle."	The victory moved Baker into a tie for 22nd place on the all-time wins list at 1,413 with Hall of Famer Miller Huggins.	San Diego trailed 2-1 when Nick Hundley led off with a single against reliever Nick Masset for only the Padres' second hit. Maybin followed with a double and pinch-hitter Eric Patterson's groundout tied it.	The Padres' rally ruined a stellar outing by Reds rookie pitcher Sam LeCure, who allowed one hit in seven innings and left with a 2-1 lead.	LeCure retired the final 12 batters he faced after allowing Alberto Gonzalez's RBI triple in the second inning. The right-hander struck out eight and walked two.	Gomes drove in one run for Cincinnati with a first-inning double and Stubbs had the other RBI on a groundout.	Gomes, who had homered in his previous two games, has seven RBIs in four games.	Cincinnati reliever Aroldis Chapman made his first appearance at Petco Park since last Sept. 24. In that outing, he threw 25 pitches and all of them registered at least 100 mph, topping out at 105 mph.	Chapman pitched a perfect seventh this time and his fastest pitch was 98 mph.	San Diego's Clayton Richard made his first start since he pitched just one inning Friday night against the Los Angeles Dodgers before a rain delay of 1 hour, 34 minutes forced him from the game. The lefty pitched well, but his throwing error contributed to Cincinnati's second run.	Richard allowed two runs on five hits over 7 2/3 innings with three strikeouts and two walks.	Gomes put the Reds ahead 1-0 with a two-out RBI double in the first inning after consecutive singles by Tony Phillips and Joey Votto.	San Diego tied the score in the second when Gonzalez doubled in Hundley, who walked. When the relay throw to third base got away, Gonzalez stumbled around third and was thrown out at the plate by Scott Rolen from foul territory down the third-base line.	Game notes	 San Diego SS Jason Bartlett missed his third straight game with a tight back. ... Cincinnati RHPs Homer Bailey and Johnny Cueto were both due to arrive in town during the game after flying in from Arizona. Bailey (right shoulder impingement) threw three innings Tuesday in Goodyear at the club's player development complex. Bailey is scheduled for a rehab start Sunday with Triple-A Louisville. Cueto (right biceps/triceps irritation) threw two innings on Monday and is set to pitch Saturday for Louisville.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SEATTLE --  Thinking back to the key strikeouts, the standing ovation and the obligatory postgame beer shower from teammates, Michael Pineda grinned like a 22-year-old that just won his first major league game.	The way he pitched on Tuesday night was far from rookie-like.	Pineda dazzled in the first home start of his career, taking a shutout into the eighth inning, and the Seattle Mariners beat the Toronto Blue Jays 3-2.	Making just his second start, Pineda left the Blue Jays guessing all night. He was clocked as high as 99 mph on the stadium radar gun, but also worked in nasty off-speed pitches, including a biting slider that left some twisted -- like Travis Snider -- and others just looking.	"I'm excited," Pineda said minutes after cleaning up from his beer shower. "It's my first game winning here. I don't know, I'm just really excited."	Pineda (1-1) went 7 1/3 strong innings, giving up just five hits, one earned run and striking out seven. His performance only raises hopes for Mariners fans of what a future rotation could be with Felix Hernandez and Pineda at the top.	And on this homestand, it was Pineda getting the best of Hernandez, who was tagged for seven earned runs and 12 hits a night earlier by the Blue Jays. Not surprising, when Pineda was pulled in the eighth, it was Hernandez pulling him aside and chatting in his ear in the dugout.	Pineda threw 103 pitches with 74 strikes. He worked ahead constantly, throwing first-pitch strikes to 23 of the 29 batters he faced. Until the eighth inning, only once did Toronto get more than one runner on base in an inning.	"We had our chances to score on him but by the sixth inning he had so much confidence that it really didn't matter," said Toronto's Adam Lind, who was 0 for 4 with a strikeout. "You could just see it, how confident he was out there."	Pineda came out for the eighth having given up just three hits and retiring the previous eight batters after Edwin Encarnacion's single in the fifth. Seattle manager Eric Wedge felt Pineda deserved the chance to get through the eighth.	But the Blue Jays changed those plans. Encarnacion started the eighth with a sharp single to left, and just as the Seattle bullpen started stirring, Pineda got Jayson Nix looking at a 97 mph fastball.	Then trouble arose. Yunel Escobar walked and after a passed ball from catcher Miguel Olivo -- a pitch where Pineda said the sign got mixed up -- Corey Patterson ended Pineda's night with a sharp single to right that scored a pair.	Pineda left to a standing ovation as Chris Ray entered to face Jose Bautista. Before Bautista could do anything, Olivo threw wildly to second as Patterson attempted to steal and advanced to third on the errant throw.	But Olivo got bailed out when Bautista popped out down the right field line. First baseman Justin Smoak made a difficult catch in foul territory with his back to home plate. He quickly spun and threw a one-hopper that Olivo caught on a short-hop and tagged Patterson trying to score the tying run.	Smoak said he didn't think about letting the ball drop, even with the difficulty of the catch-and-throw, because it was Bautista at the plate.	"He can hit a homer anytime," Smoak said. "It went up and I had a chance to catch it and I knew if I caught it, let it go. It happened to be on the money and was a good play."	Brandon League pitched the ninth for his second save in as many chances.	Ryan Langerhans hit a two-run homer in the third off Toronto starter Ricky Romero, who was otherwise brilliant. Romero (1-1) retired 14 straight at one point and pitched into the eighth.	But this time the Mariners got their offense started earlier than a night before when they scored eight runs in the final three innings for a stunning 8-7 win over the Blue Jays.	Langerhans' homer was his third of the season and he has only four hits overall in 19 at-bats to that point. Milton Bradley added an RBI single later in the inning, fighting off a tough 2-2 pitch to score Jack Wilson.	Game notes	 Escobar walked in the eighth and has reached base in all nine games he's appeared in this season. ... Injured Seattle closer David Aardsma threw a simulated inning of 25 pitches on Tuesday as he continues to recover from offseason hip surgery. Wedge said the plan is for Aardsma to go with the team on its four-game road trip to Kansas City and throw another simulated game before deciding on a rehab assignment. ... Seattle's rally on Monday night was the fifth time in club history they had overcome a deficit of seven or more runs. All the previous comebacks started in the fifth inning or sooner.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Bearded closer Brian Wilson jogged to the mound as the sellout crowd roared. He then struck out the side for his first save, and just like that things seemed back to normal for the San Francisco Giants.	At least for a night anyway. The reigning World Series champions won by a single run, a familiar practice for this bunch, and Wilson was his reliable old self.	Aaron Rowand tripled leading off the seventh and scored the go-ahead run moments later on a wild pitch, and the Giants beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-4 on Tuesday night when Wilson sealed the deal without any extra drama.	"That's the Wilson everybody wants to see," ace Tim Lincecum said.	"We've got Wilson back," Pablo Sandoval said. "That was the Wilson we know."	Last year's majors saves leader with 48, Wilson started the season on the disabled list and had allowed five total runs in his first two appearances since being activated -- giving him a 33.75 ERA entering his outing Tuesday. He lowered that number to 19.29 with the 1-2-3, 14-pitch ninth.	"I pitched three outs today, didn't get in trouble, which is good," Wilson said. "I was staying ahead in the count for the most part, trying to pump the strike zone and trying not to beat myself, get behind in the count, walk guys. I'm going to get beat. They're going to have to beat me."	Rowand, filling in for injured center fielder Andres Torres, added an RBI single in the fifth. The triple was his fifth in the regular season in five years.	Jeremy Affeldt (1-0) earned the win despite allowing pinch-hitter Marcus Thames' tying homer to start the top of the seventh.	Blake Hawksworth (1-1) took the loss.	On a raw, windy night that began with strong early showings by Lincecum and Dodgers righty Chad Billingsley, San Francisco generated just enough offense against Los Angeles' bullpen. The Giants beat the Dodgers for the second time in five tries so far this year.	The highlight for the hard-throwing Lincecum in his home debut came on defense. He stopped Andre Ethier's hard grounder to start the sixth with a fancy play. The ball came off his glove and landed between the mound and second base. The two-time NL Cy Young Award winner chased it down with a nifty sliding, spinning move and fired to first while on both knees.	He then allowed back-to-back singles to Matt Kemp and James Loney before plunking 2010 teammate Juan Uribe for the second time this year to load the bases. Lincecum's night was done after he hit Uribe. Uribe pointed at his left shoulder area and signaled with two fingers to plate umpire Sam Holbrook that it was the second time Lincecum hit him this year.	The ball carried on a crisp night in which the Dodgers wore hooded sweat shirts during batting practice, with the wind whipping to right-center at 21 to 27 mph. First-pitch temperature was 55 degrees.	In the seventh, Thames hit an off-speed pitch from Affeldt and sent it about halfway up the left-field bleachers for his sixth career pinch-hit homer. It was his first since June 8, 2009, against the White Sox in Chicago while with the Tigers.	But the Giants got it right back in the bottom half when Rowand started a rally with his triple.	San Francisco (5-6) bounced back after falling 6-1 to Clayton Kershaw and the Dodgers in Monday's series opener.	Sandoval doubled in the fourth to pull the Giants to 3-2, driving a low pitch down the first-base line. First baseman Loney had moved back about 10 feet on the 3-2 pitch to guard against the ball down the line, but lunged toward second and couldn't recover.	"My thinking in that situation is I know Pablo is a very aggressive hitter and I didn't have to throw my breaking ball for a strike there on a 3-2 pitch," Billingsley said. "I just wanted to have something around the zone, something to maybe get a ground ball somewhere or a swing and a miss. That's the way the game is. Things don't go the way you want to and you can't do anything about it."	Both starting pitchers faced the minimum through three with just one baserunner, then each had to throw 32 pitches to get through the fourth. Lincecum had made 49 pitches through the first three innings but wound up with 115 in 5 1/3 innings.	The Dodgers played without two key members of their infield. Shortstop and leadoff hitter Rafael Furcal was placed on the 15-day disabled list after he broke his left thumb while sliding headfirst into third base on a steal during Monday night's 6-1 win.	While he won't need surgery, Furcal is expected to miss four to six weeks.	Jamey Carroll will pick up much of the load at shortstop and Uribe also will get time there. Buster Posey's RBI single in the fifth glanced off the glove of a lunging Carroll.	Third baseman Casey Blake missed his third straight start with a deep thigh bruise on his left leg that happened when San Diego baserunner Chase Headley's knee got him in a collision Saturday. He hopes to be back for Wednesday's series finale.	Giants rookie Brandon Belt snapped an 0-for-11 funk with his single leading off the fifth. It was just his second hit of the homestand and sixth in 37 at-bats overall.	Game notes	 Hawksworth's wild pitch was only the second of his career in 80 overall appearances. ... 1B Belt took flyballs in RF for the second straight day and manager Bruce Bochy is considering switching him out there for a game soon and bringing Aubrey Huff in to play 1B. Belt's fourth-inning error was the Giants' 10th in 11 games. ... The Giants raised nearly $70,000 to help longtime fan Bryan Stow, who was severely beaten outside Dodger Stadium on March 31. ... The Giants sold out their fifth straight home game to start the year and 15th in a row dating to last Oct. 1 for the opener of a season-ending series vs. San Diego.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DETROIT --  Brandon Inge rounded third base, tossed his helmet joyfully in the air and then did a little spin as he jumped into a big group of teammates at the plate.	After a shaky start to the season, the Detroit Tigers finally won a series -- and against the defending American League champions.	Inge hit a solo home run in the bottom of the ninth inning, and the Tigers beat the Texas Rangers in their last at-bat for the second straight day, 3-2 on Wednesday. Detroit took two of three from Texas and improved to 5-7 on the season.	"Maybe this can jump-start us and get us going," Inge said.	With one out, Inge hit the first pitch from Darren Oliver (1-1) over the left-field wall. The previous day, Detroit beat the Rangers 5-4 on a ninth-inning single by Miguel Cabrera.	"It looked like a slider down the middle," Inge said. "I knew he had thrown me a couple of those yesterday or the day before, but I wasn't really looking for any pitch. I just wanted something over the middle."	Texas star Josh Hamilton broke his arm Tuesday, and the AL MVP could miss two months. The Rangers took a 2-0 lead without him, but Detroit's Victor Martinez and Brennan Boesch led off the bottom of the sixth with back-to-back doubles. Boesch eventually scored to make it 2-all on Inge's sacrifice fly.	"I thought that was really a good game," Detroit manager Jim Leyland said. "We knew it might be hard to score runs, because they were going to be using a lot of pitchers, and that makes it tough on the hitters. You don't get into a rhythm against one guy when you are seeing a lot of them."	Texas used five pitchers, getting only three innings out of spot starter Dave Bush. The Rangers' rotation has been taxed because of a doubleheader Saturday.	Bush, in his first appearance of the season, kept Detroit off the scoreboard, but he allowed three hits and three walks and threw 71 pitches.	"My pitch count was awfully high for three innings," Bush said. "That was the determining factor in me coming out. It's been so long since I've pitched, I really didn't want to go out and blow it out in the first time out. ... I'll take the three zeros."	Bush made a nice play in the second when he fell to the ground while fielding a grounder by Alex Avila and was still able to throw home in time to catch Boesch trying to score from third. After loading the bases with two walks, Bush got Will Rhymes to ground out to end the inning.	Hamilton was injured the previous day while being thrown out at the plate when he tagged up on a foul popup. Manager Ron Washington said before the game his team wouldn't be any less aggressive on the bases, and Texas stole three bases Wednesday.	The Rangers took a 2-0 lead in the sixth. With a runner on second, Nelson Cruz hit a line drive toward shortstop Jhonny Peralta -- but Adrian Beltre was right in front of Peralta, screening him before sprawling on the ground to avoid being hit. The ball skipped past Peralta for a single, scoring Beltre.	David Murphy added a run-scoring single. Both Texas runs in that inning scored on singles after runners moved from first to second on wild pitches.	Detroit starter Max Scherzer went six innings, allowing two runs on seven hits. He struck out seven and walked two. Brayan Villarreal pitched the seventh and eighth for the Tigers.	Jose Valverde (2-0) pitched a scoreless top of the ninth.	"We had the AL champs in here, and played three great games against them, and won the last two in the ninth inning," Leyland said. "That's something that will get the fans excited, and that's something we all want."	Game notes	 Texas RHP Colby Lewis' wife Jenny gave birth to daughter Elizabeth Grace on Wednesday. ... Murphy started in left field, Hamilton's normal spot. He stole two bases, although he was also thrown out on the bases in the sixth. With men on first and third, Scherzer stepped toward third and threw to first, trapping baserunner Julio Borbon off the base. Murphy broke from third to home and was thrown out easily. ... The Tigers were again without OF Magglio Ordonez, who has been having problems with his surgically repaired right ankle. ... Detroit optioned RHP Robbie Weinhardt to Triple-A Toledo. The Tigers expect to call up RHP Alberto Albuquerque on Thursday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Mike Aviles didn't feel he was in a funk. Even at 0-for-18, he didn't consider that long enough to be a slump.	No need to think about that anymore.	Aviles doubled twice and drove in three runs as the Kansas City Royals became the latest team to tag Francisco Liriano, roughing up the Minnesota Twins 10-5.	Alex Gordon added two hits and drove in two runs. The Royals scored six times in the fourth inning to break open the game.	"Eighteen at-bats over the course of 500, 600 at-bats really is just a little down period," Aviles said. "It wasn't that big of a deal. I was fine, still am."	Kyle Davies (1-1) won despite allowing five runs and 10 hits in five innings. Three relievers combined on four scoreless innings, giving up just two hits. Jeremy Jeffress finished with two innings for his first major league save.	"It was a day of bunches," Kansas City manager Ned Yost said. "We bunched together a bunch of hits and then they came back and bunched together a bunch of hits. Again, our bullpen is spectacular and did the job."	Liriano (0-3) gave up six straight hits during the Royals' big inning. He began the game with a 7.71 ERA after the Toronto Blue Jays and New York Yankees knocked him around in his first two starts.	Denard Span was 4-for-4 and scored twice for the Twins, who started the day as the lowest-scoring team in the majors.	"I thought the last couple of days the ball was coming off our bats pretty good," Minnesota manager Ron Gardenhire said. "We had a lot better at-bats and made some things happen. We got back into the game today by swinging the bats and having some good at-bats."	Kansas City is showing no such problem with its bats.	The Royals started the day with the AL's second-best batting average and every starter except Matt Treanor finished with a hit.	"We've gotten on base a lot and if we don't get it here, we'll get it there," Kansas City's Billy Butler said. "We're just doing a good job of putting pressure on teams. We have to continue to do that, force the issue and keep taking the extra base."	Liriano went 14-10 with a 3.62 ERA last year and ranked fifth in the AL with 201 strikeouts. The left-hander is still trying to re-establish his dominance after elbow surgery four years ago.	Liriano held the Royals hitless through the first three innings. The second time through the order, however, proved a tougher task. That's been his pattern this year -- in their first plate appearance against Liriano, hitters are batting just .083.	Overall, Liriano gave up seven runs and eight hits in five innings. He struck out four and walked one.	Gardenhire has been telling Liriano to relax, trust his movement and pitch to contact. In the first three innings, Liriano holds a 2.00 ERA; from the fourth inning on, his ERA jumps to 18.56 and hitters are hitting .448 off him.	"I threw more fastballs than I'm used to today," Liriano said. "I just wanted them to put the ball in play and not strike them out."	Kansas City opened the fourth with five straight singles before a two-run double by Aviles. Alcides Escobar later singled and Chris Getz had an RBI single.	"Balls just seemed to find holes," Gardenhire said. "Nothing was hit really hard. Maybe a couple of them, but balls just kept finding places and rolling through."	Aviles added an RBI double in the sixth after Minnesota struck for four runs in the fifth against Davies. Gordon hit a two-run double as part of a three-run ninth.	The Twins scored in the first inning for the first time this season but missed a prime opportunity for more.	Span opened with a single, the first leadoff hit for Minnesota this season, and later scored. The Twins had runners at first and third with no outs, but a pair of popouts and a strikeout ended the threat for Davies.	Game notes	 The Royals' bullpen has an ERA of 1.72 in the last five games. ... Liriano was 2-0 with a 1.29 ERA last season against Kansas City. He only allowed two earned runs in 14 innings. ... The Twins led the majors in first-inning runs last season but had failed to score in the first or second innings in any game this season. The three first-inning hits equaled their season total. Minnesota entered the game 3-for-33 in the first inning, with two walks and 11 strikeouts. ... Yost said before the game that Robinson Tejeda would not be used as his primary setup reliever. Tejeda failed to retire a batter in the 10th inning of Tuesday's 4-3 loss, surrendering three hits and a walk.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

CHICAGO --  An angry Ozzie Guillen jumped up from his postgame news conference and made a hasty exit. His bullpen had a late-inning meltdown for the third time in less than a week and it was eating at the emotional Chicago White Sox manager.	"I might call Bobby Thigpen to help us," he said of the former White Sox closer who saved 57 games in 1990.	The White Sox carried a three-run lead into the ninth inning Wednesday, but three relievers struggled as the Oakland Athletics tied the game. They plated three more in the 10th for a 7-4 victory.	"When you have a bad bullpen, that's what happens. That's what happens," Guillen said.	Matt Thornton (0-2), who won the closer's job in the spring, blew his fourth save in as many chances. The White Sox also let leads slip away last Friday against Tampa Bay -- they led by three headed into the ninth before giving up five -- and in Monday night's home opener against the A's when they led 1-0 after eight before losing 2-1 in 10.	"Oh man," Thornton said. "There's nothing to even describe it right now. Frustration is pretty high. ... Confidence isn't the problem. It's my frustration right now. It's the most frustrated I've been in a long time. I can't remember a run of games like this where I haven't gotten the job done that many times in a row."	Coco Crisp had the go-ahead single in the 10th after Thornton had walked two batters. Daric Barton then had a two-run single.	Cliff Pennington's two-out, two-run single off Thornton in the ninth tied it at 4.	With the White Sox leading 4-1 in the ninth, Chris Sale gave up a leadoff double to Conor Jackson, an RBI single to Josh Willingham and a single to Hideki Matsui. Jesse Crain came on and walked pinch-hitter Barton to load the bases before fanning Kurt Suzuki.	Thornton then struck out pinch hitter Ryan Sweeney for the second out before No. 9 hitter Pennington dropped his clutch hit into center.	"I don't have any closer. I don't," Guillen said. "You are just scratching your head and second-guess yourself what you are doing wrong, bringing people to the mound with three-run lead ... and we can't hold the lead. That's not a good sign. Have we got the people out there with the arms? Yes."	Sale pitched two innings Tuesday night and got the win. Guillen said before Wednesday's game he planned to avoid the young reliever for the day game.	"Three-run lead and he said he can go. That's the reason we put him there," Guillen said.	"Yesterday I was right where I needed to be. I tried to use that today. Just location. Leaving balls up and there were too many hittable pitches," Sale said.	Oakland's rally denied John Danks a victory after he gave up a run and five hits in eight solid innings.	"Ten times out of 10 times we want the bullpen coming in with a three-run lead," Danks said. "We have every confidence in the world. I know they have gotten off to kind of a slow start. These guys can pitch, man. These guys have good stuff. We want them out there."	The White Sox broke a 1-all tie in the sixth against Oakland starter Brett Anderson when Carlos Quentin was hit by a pitch, Alex Rios doubled and a sliding Quentin scored on Ramon Castro's grounder to third that drew a high throw to the plate from Kevin Kouzmanoff.	Brent Morel dropped down a bunt to score Rios from third for a 3-1 lead. Juan Pierre's third single of the game chased Anderson (0-2), who was hurt by his own error in the fifth. Anderson gave up nine hits and three runs -- two earned -- in 5 2/3 innings.	Chicago added a run in the eighth when Rios walked, stole second, moved up on a sacrifice and scored on Kouzmanoff's throwing error.	Game notes	Pierre reached base five times Wednesday -- on three hits,	an error and a walk. ... Guillen said the	fans' reaction to Pierre on Tuesday night, giving him a mock cheer	every time he catches a fly ball, was unfair to the left fielder.	Pierre twice dropped fly balls during the current homestand that	led to late meltdowns and losses by the White Sox. "He doesn't	deserve that," Guillen said. There were a few boos in the third	inning Wednesday when Pierre fumbled Pennington's single for an	error, allowing him to advance to second base. Pierre now has three	errors in 12 games. He made only one error in the previous	two seasons combined, a span of 305 games.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

SEATTLE -- The two previous times Jose Bautista came up with runners in scoring position -- and failed to come through -- were still in the back of his mind when he stepped to the plate in the eighth inning with two more runners on base.	Unlike those previous two at-bats -- both times Bautista fouled out -- the Blue Jays slugger didn't miss.	Down by a run and facing a fifth straight loss, Bautista came through with a three-run homer off Seattle reliever Chris Ray in the eighth. It was the start of a six-run inning by the Blue Jays, who avoided a three-game sweep by the Mariners with an 8-3 win on Wednesday.	It was Bautista's third homer of the season, and with the way Toronto had dropped its previous four games, it was a much-needed hit.	"I look at the same situations and I want to come through as well. I know I'm in the middle of the lineup and late in the game when the game is close the team is relying on me," Bautista said. "It happened twice, once last night and one earlier today where I couldn't get it done. It's a little bit frustrating, but you're going to get more situations like that and luckily I had another one and I was able to come through."	Much to the delight of the many Blue Jays fans that made the drive down from British Columbia, Bautista unloaded on a 2-1 breaking ball that Ray (1-1) left in the middle of the plate, hitting it into the Toronto bullpen in left field -- where reliever Jon Rauch caught the homer as he was warming up.	It snapped an 17-inning scoreless streak by the Mariners' bullpen, ruining a strong start by Seattle lefty Jason Vargas.	Bautista's homer was just the start. Toronto sent 11 batters to the plate in the inning, unleashing a few days of frustration after the Jays wasted a seven-run lead on Monday night, then losing a one-run game on Tuesday.	"We've talked about resiliency a number of times and this might be another case of it," Toronto manager John Farrell said.	The eighth started innocently enough with a broken-bat single up the middle by Yunel Escobar, but Corey Patterson followed with a bunt single. Bautista, who struck out twice earlier and fouled out down the left-field line in a key spot in the fifth, then deposited Ray's pitch.	The Jays weren't done as Jayson Nix doubled and later scored on Edwin Encarnacion's two-out double. Ray was finally pulled, leaving to a smattering of boos from the tiny afternoon crowd on a chilly and damp day.	Ray, who made the club out of spring training after going to camp on a minor-league deal, has allowed 11 hits, eight earned runs and two homers in 4 2/3 innings so far this season.	"I ended up hanging a 2-1 slider. It was a bad pitch," Ray said. "I threw a good one to him 1-1 and just missed. I came back and it just hung. He's known for his power and he got it."	Josh Lueke took over and didn't fare much better. He walked John McDonald, then gave up a two-run double to Molina, his third hit and second double of the afternoon, and a single to Escobar before finally getting a strikeout of Patterson to end the inning.	The six-run inning was Toronto's biggest outburst of the young season.	Reliever Marc Rzepczynski (1-0) got the win in relief of rookie Kyle Drabek. Rzepczynski threw two innings of hitless relief, striking out a pair. His biggest out was his first, when he got Ichiro Suzuki on strikes to end the sixth inning with runners on first and third.	"Looking at it, it felt like that [at-bat] was the game, either keeping it in control or [them] putting a crooked number on the board," Farrell said.	Seattle had taken a 2-1 lead earlier in the inning when Justin Smoak hit an opposite-field solo homer on a 3-2 pitch from Drabek. The rookie left later in the sixth after allowing walks to Ryan Langerhans and Chris Gimenez. Drabek gave up six hits, struck out five and walked four. He threw 114 pitches, but his strikes-to-balls ratio was almost even: 59 strikes, 55 balls.	It was the most pitches Drabek has thrown in his six major league starts.	"I started to get behind early and I had to battle my way back," Drabek said. "I would like to get ahead in the count so [I'm] going to have to work on that."	Game notes	 For the second time in three games, the Mariners set a new record low for attendance at Safeco Field on Wednesday: 12,407. The previous low was set on Monday night at 13,056. ... Toronto optioned reliever Brad Mills back to Triple-A Las Vegas after the game. A corresponding roster move is expected before Friday's game in Boston. ... Seattle CF Franklin Gutierrez is expected to go on a rehab assignment at Triple-A Tacoma this weekend. Manager Eric Wedge says after three games at Tacoma, Gutierrez will be re-evaluated. Seattle opens a seven-game homestand next Monday.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN DIEGO -- Orlando Hudson more than made up for a botched bunt.	Hudson scored the tying run in the eighth inning and then hit a bases-loaded, opposite-field single with two outs in the ninth to give the San Diego Padres a 3-2 win against the Cincinnati Reds on Wednesday night that prevented a three-game sweep.	The victory came less than 24 hours after the Padres had numerous chances Tuesday night before losing 8-2 in 11 innings. They had runners on second and third with none out in the eighth, then had the bases loaded in both the ninth and 10th. The Padres were 2 for 22 with runners in scoring position in the series.	"No matter how you get the win, it's a huge win after a tough couple of losses," Hudson said. "That's a good team over there. They've got good pitching, they've got good hitting, they've got a good bullpen. They've got a lineup that can swing it. The MVP in their lineup, you can't get out. Everything you throw him, he hits."	Hudson was referring to Joey Votto, the reigning NL MVP who had three hits to raise his average to .444.	With the score tied at 2, pinch-hitter Brad Hawpe started the winning rally with a one-out walk before advancing to third on Nick Hundley's hit-and-run single to right. Will Venable was intentionally walked to get to Jason Bartlett, who was hitting just .133. Bartlett grounded to third baseman Juan Francisco, who threw to home for the force.	Hudson then hit the first pitch he saw from Nick Masset (0-3) over third baseman Juan Francisco's head and into left field for the win.	"He was the right guy in the right spot," said manager Bud Black, who was ejected in the fourth inning for arguing balls and strikes, and was replaced by bench coach Rick Renteria. "He jumped on a first-pitch fastball."	Masset has struggled so far this season.	"The ball is not going my way right now," he said. "I'm just trying to do what I can to get people out."	The Padres scored an unearned run without getting a hit in the eighth to tie it at 2. With Bartlett on second after a leadoff walk and a throwing error by reliever Aroldis Chapman, Hudson bunted but it rolled right to Chapman, who threw out Bartlett at third. Hudson stole second and took third on catcher Ryan Hanigan's throw into center for Cincinnati's second error of the inning. He scored on Jorge Cantu's chopper to third.	"Definitely I was frustrated. My manager asked me to get the bunt down. I didn't do my job. Also, I'm human, too. It's not going to happen 10 out of 10 times. But I was very frustrated," Hudson said. "I had to some way, somehow, get to second base and get in scoring position for the big boys behind me. Once I saw the throw get through I got to third, but I still was frustrated by not getting that bunt down."	Heath Bell (1-0) pitched the ninth for the win.	Votto had three hits for the Reds, including an RBI double.	San Diego's Tim Stauffer allowed only one hit through three innings before getting in trouble in the fourth and falling behind 1-0. Votto hit a leadoff single to left, advanced to third on Jonny Gomes' single to center and scored when Juan Francisco's grounder forced Gomes. Chris Heisey's double to left-center bounced over the fence, forcing Francisco to stop at third, and Ramon Hernandez was intentionally walked to load the bases before Stauffer retired the side.	"Kind of what cost us was the fact we had opportunities early in the game and didn't get anybody in," manager Dusty Baker said. "Those things come back to haunt you. Plus, the late-inning walks hurt."	The Reds made it 2-0 in the fifth when Votto doubled in Drew Stubbs, who hit a leadoff single to left and advanced on Brandon Phillips' grounder.	Wood struggled in the seventh, when he loaded the bases with one out by allowing singles to Chase Headley and Chris Denorfia, and walking Rob Johnson. Pinch-hitter Hundley hit a sacrifice fly to chase Wood. Jordan Smith came on and got the final out.	Wood allowed one run and five hits in 6 2/3 innings, struck out five and walked three. Stauffer went 4 1-3, allowing two runs and six hits, with four strikeouts and two walks.	Game notes	 Black was ejected by home plate umpire Angel Hernandez as the top of the fourth inning ended for arguing balls and strikes. Black was yapping after Hernandez didn't call a strike on a 2-2 curveball to Wood. Hernandez did call a strike on the next pitch, then almost immediately ejected Black. Black came out and spoke with crew chief Joe West for a few minutes. ... Heisey made two nice catches in RF for the Reds, including a diving catch of Denorfia's fly ball along the line for the first out of the ninth, and a sliding basket catch of Cameron Maybin's fly ball for the final out of the fifth. ... Reds 2B Phillips came out in the bottom of the ninth. Baker said he hurt his leg but didn't have more specific information.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Vernon Wells, off to a horrendous start in his first season with the Los Angeles Angels, contributed to the winning rally after getting a much-needed day off.	The three-time All-Star, mired in 4 for 48 rut, singled sharply into the hole off the glove of shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera with one out in the 12th and scored on Jeff Mathis' bases-loaded sacrifice fly to give the Angels a 4-3 victory over the Cleveland Indians on Sunday in the rubber game of their three-game series.	"You know what? He needed that," teammate Torii Hunter said of Wells, who joined the Angels in a January trade with Toronto. "He squared the ball up and got that feel again of hitting the ball hard.	"This is definitely a totally different scene for him. He was in Toronto for 12 years, and I definitely feel that has something to do with it. I mean, you change scenery, it feels uncomfortable sometimes and you feel like you're not welcomed until you do something special. And today he got that rally started. He's on his way, and it's uphill from here."	Chad Durbin (0-1) walked Alberto Callaspo after Wells' hit, and both runners advanced on a wild pitch to rookie Mark Trumbo.	"There's no need to put a guy into scoring position. You have to make them hit the guy there," Durbin said. "Making them hit a ground ball was all I was thinking. I kept trying to throw sinkers middle-away and let it run off the plate or down, but I wasn't very efficient. I wasn't being aggressive over the plate. That's what a reliever has to do -- attack the zone."	An intentional walk to Trumbo loaded the bases for Mathis, who lifted a 2-1 pitch to medium center field and Wells streaked home ahead of Michael Brantley's throw. Last September at Anaheim, Mathis beat the Indians by the same 4-3 score in the 16th inning with a sacrifice fly.	"We just played a hot team, and they won eight in a row before yesterday. So just to cool those guys down shows that we're playing pretty well ourselves," Hunter said.	Hisanori Takahashi (1-0) posted his first AL victory with two perfect innings. The left-hander was 10-6 with the Mets last season as a rookie with 3.61 ERA in 53 appearances, including 12 starts.	Angels right-hander Ervin Santana, still looking for his first win of the season, gave up three runs and six hits over seven-plus innings and struck out three.	Santana, who has spent his entire seven-year career with the Angels and defeated every American League team except Cleveland, entered the eighth with a 3-2 lead and departed after giving up a leadoff single to Adam Everett.	Brantley greeted Scott Downs with a single that sent Everett to third. Everett was caught in a rundown and tagged out by third baseman Callaspo after he fielded Cabrera's grounder. But Brantley and Cabrera both advanced on Downs' wild pitch, and Brantley scored the tying run on a groundout by Shin-Soo Choo before Fernando Rodney came in and struck out Carlos Santana.	The blown save by Downs left Santana's career record against the Indians at 0-6 with a 4.98 ERA.	"He has great life on his fastball, a great sinker and a slider that he can throw for strikes anytime he wants," said Indians shortstop Orlando Cabrera, who played for the Angels during Santana's first three seasons in the majors. "When you have the stuff that Ervin has, it was just a matter of him staying healthy. I've been watching him on TV, and he's become a pitcher, not a thrower. And he's got a great team behind him that can make good plays defensively."	Cleveland had runners at the corners with one out in the fourth, but Santana escaped the jam on a double-play grounder by Orlando Cabrera, whose comebacker deflected off the pitcher's glove to second baseman Howie Kendrick.	The Angels got three in the bottom half against Carlos Carrasco for a 3-1 lead. Kendrick led off with a double in the gap and circled the bases on a throwing error to second base by Asdrubal Cabrera, who was in short left field along with Orlando Cabrera for the cutoff throw as first baseman Matt LaPorta hustled over to cover the bag.	Bobby Abreu then drew his sixth walk of the series and Hunter drove an 0-1 pitch over the wall in left-center, the 15th homer by the Angels this season and only the second with anyone on base.	"He just hung a slider. I saw it, my radar went off and I was able to put something on it," Hunter said.	Cleveland got a run back in the fifth when Everett beat out a two-out single to deep shortstop and scored on Brantley's double.	Carrasco allowed three runs and five hits over seven innings with five strikeouts and two walks.	"Carrasco threw a tremendous ballgame and had a very live fastball," manager Manny Acta said. "I don't think he gave up anything on the fastball. The home run came was on a slider and Kendrick's double was on a breaking ball."	Game notes	 Angels relievers have not been charged with a run in 22 innings over their last seven games, after giving up 14 runs and six homers in 18 1/3 innings during the team's first five games of the season. ... Indians RHP Joe Smith, who began the season on the 15-day disabled list because of a strained abdominal muscle, is expected to be activated on Friday for the opener of a three-game series against Baltimore at Progressive Field. CF Grady Sizemore and INF-DH Jason Donald, who have been on rehab assignments with Double-A Akron, will join Triple-A Columbus on Thursday for a game at Toledo.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

NEW YORK --  A.J. Burnett didn't have an explanation for why he's always had success in April with the Yankees. He does know why everything was working Wednesday night.	"If they come out swinging the bats like that -- I got a four-run lead -- I can just take a breath and go at it," Burnett said.	Burnett remained undefeated in April with the Yankees by pitching effectively into the seventh inning, and Alex Rodriguez hit a three-run homer as New York scored six early runs in a 7-4 victory over the Baltimore Orioles.	Robinson Cano added a two-run double. Mark Teixeira had two hits and Jorge Posada homered as both ended slumps and helped New York move into a tie atop the AL East with the Orioles. Baltimore lost its third in a row on a misty, 48-degree night.	Derek Jeter matched Barry Bonds for 32nd on the all-time hits list with 2,935 on the day the former slugger was convicted in a San Francisco courtroom of obstruction of justice.	Jeter had two singles. He has more hits (293) against the Orioles than any other team.	Matt Wieters and Brian Roberts each hit two-run homers in the seventh to make things interesting. Roberts' one-out drive into the Yankees' bullpen in right-center ended the night for Burnett (3-0).	The Yankees had to wait a while to play again after being two-hit by Boston's Josh Beckett on Sunday night -- New York was off Monday, and Tuesday night's game was rained out.	"Maybe the couple of days helped," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "You want to be able to get on the board and get your starting pitcher some runs early."	Chris Tillman (0-1) gave up four straight hits to start the first inning. Teixeira snapped an 0-for-18 slide with a single and Rodriguez lined a drive over the wall in right field for his 617th career home run and a 3-0 lead.	"It helps to get off to a good start," Rodriguez said. "Anytime you can get our starting pitching a nice lead, it helps."	In the second, Jeter drove in a run with a high chopper that went for an infield hit. Rodriguez walked and Cano followed with a bases-loaded double that ended Tillman's night after 1 2/3 innings.	"It's real disappointing," Tillman said. "Coming out of the bullpen I felt real good. I thought I had good stuff."	The Yankees could've had more but center fielder Adam Jones made a spectacular diving catch, sliding on his stomach along the wet grass to grab Posada's short fly to end the inning with the bases loaded.	Burnett was dominant for six innings, working the corners of the plate with his fastball and making the Orioles chase a deceptive changeup and a biting curveball that often hit the dirt. He gave up a leadoff hit to Brian Roberts, doubles to Mark Reynolds and Wieters, and a single to Vladimir Guerrero.	"He had a good changeup. He threw a lot of them," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. "We were able to get him to 50 pitches in about two innings or so but we couldn't hold the tide and couldn't get back in the ballgame."	Yankees catcher Russell Martin said of Burnett's reluctance to throw the changeup in training camp: "It's weird not knowing how good a pitch it was."	In the seventh, he gave up a one-out double to Reynolds before Wieters connected for his first homer of the season. Robert Andino walked, then Roberts homered to make it 7-4, and David Robertson took over.	Burnett allowed four runs and seven hits in 6 1/3 innings. He walked two, threw three wild pitches and struck out five. The right-hander improved to 8-0 in 13 starts with New York in April since becoming a Yankee in 2009. He also improved to 12-4 against Baltimore and won his first three starts to open a season for the first time.	Rafael Soriano gave up a hit in the eighth and Mariano Rivera was perfect in the ninth for his fifth save.	Posada ended an 0-for-19 skid in the fifth with a drive into the stands down the right-field line.	On a milestone night, Rodriguez passed Ken Griffey Jr. and tied Al Simmons and Ted Williams for 11th place all-time with 1,839 RBIs.	NOTES: After the game, Girardi said an MRI on injured LHP Pedro Feliciano's shoulder showed damage. He said no course of action will be taken until Feliciano discusses it with the doctors, and his agent and family. ... The Orioles placed SS J.J. Hardy (strained left side muscle) on the 15-day DL and recalled Brad Bergesen, who threw two scoreless innings of relief. ... Yankees backup C Francisco Cervelli (broken left foot) has resumed taking batting practice. ... The Yankees placed RHP Luis Ayala (strained back muscle) on the 15-day DL and recalled RHP Hector Noesi from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

WASHINGTON -- Roy Halladay followed eight dominant innings with one rather shaky one and, suddenly, Philadelphia Phillies manager Charlie Manuel was ambling out to the mound.	Pulling his pitcher? Nope. More like a quick chat, to hear Manuel tell it.	"I said: 'Well Roy, here I am," Manuel recounted. "He said: 'I got 'em.' He said: 'I got 'em. I got 'em." So Manuel finished off the exchange by telling the righty: "Well, OK. You got 'em, then."	Halladay certainly did.	Finishing with a flourish, Halladay struck out the game's last two batters with his final six pitches, holding on to throw his first complete game of 2011 and lead the Phillies past the Washington Nationals 3-2 Wednesday night.	Through eight shutout innings, Halladay (2-0) allowed only a pair of singles by Adam LaRoche, who talked his way back into Washington's lineup despite a hurt groin. In the ninth, Halladay allowed four hits, including RBI singles by Laynce Nix and Danny Espinosa.	"It may be naive, but I never felt in trouble. I felt like it was just a matter of making good pitches," said Halladay, who finished with nine strikeouts and two walks. "There was never like a panic or rush feeling."	With two on and one out, the two-time Cy Young Award winner fanned pinch-hitter Matt Stairs and Ivan Rodriguez, who argued the game-ending call on Halladay's 123rd pitch at length.	"From where I was at, it looked like he had it all going. He could throw any pitch at any time," Nationals manager Jim Riggleman said. "He's the real deal."	John Lannan (1-1) fell to 0-9 against Philadelphia despite pitching solidly Wednesday.	"Going against a guy like Halladay, you've got to match him, and I didn't do that," Lannan said. "I won't be happy until we beat them -- and I pitch."	He allowed only two earned runs -- plus one that was unearned -- and six hits, five of which were singles. Shortstop Ian Desmond's two errors in the fourth led to one run, and the Phillies added two in the fifth, including when Lannan hit Ryan Howard on the bottom of his right wrist with the bases loaded.	Howard had X-rays, which showed nothing was broken.	All in all, Lannan wasn't bad, but nothing compared to what Halladay produced. If Lannan can't beat the Phillies, Halladay can't lose -- well, almost can't -- to the Nationals or anyone in the NL East, for that matter. He is now 9-1 against the club over his career, and has won his 11 starts against division opponents since June 2010.	"He beared down at the end. He reached back and got something. Good pitchers do," Manuel said. "When you reach down and do, that means you're in good shape."	The scariest moment for Halladay -- and his team -- came in the fourth, when half of Espinosa's broken, splintered bat flew directly at the pitcher's head. Halladay ducked out of harm's way at the last instant, and his defense recorded a double play.	"Not scary," he said. "Shocking."	Halladay walked one batter in 15 2/3 innings this season before he issued consecutive free passes to Desmond and Rick Ankiel in the third. But ex-Phillies outfielder Jayson Werth -- booed by large batches of Philadelphia fans each time he strode to the plate -- grounded out to end the inning.	The last time Halladay walked two batters in a row also came against the Nationals, on Aug. 20 last season, when Adam Dunn and Ryan Zimmerman drew bases on balls in the first inning.	After LaRoche's second hit, leading off the fourth, Halladay retired 14 of 15 batters.	"He did what he always does," LaRoche said. "He's around the zone, a ton of strikes. That being said, not a lot over the heart of the plate."	Then came the ninth, when Ankiel led off with a double, and Werth singled, putting runners at the corners. After LaRoche struck out, Nix singled to right, ending Halladay's scoreless streak against Washington after 30 innings. Espinosa then scored another with an infield single.	With Jose Contreras warming up in the bullpen, Manuel went out for a visit, but left Halladay in.	Good call.	"You feel you should clean it up on your own," Halladay said, "instead of bringing someone else in."	Game notes	 Wednesday was the second anniversary of the death of Phillies announcer Harry Kalas, who collapsed in the broadcast booth at Nationals Park before a game on April 13, 2009. "We lost a tremendous person. He was a face for the Phillies -- a voice. He'd been around a long time. He was very popular and well-liked," Manuel said. "He was good for Philadelphia, he was good for the Phillies, and he was good for baseball."	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ATLANTA --  Josh Johnson was almost unhittable. Everyone agrees he can be even better.	Johnson took a no-hit bid into the eighth inning before rookie Freddie Freeman doubled with one out and the Florida Marlins beat the Atlanta Braves 5-1 on Wednesday night.	Johnson (2-0), who held the New York Mets hitless for six innings on Opening Day, dominated the Braves for 7 1/3 innings, striking out nine and walking three.	"Actually, I felt better my first two starts than tonight," Johnson said, adding that he "couldn't really find my rhythm" and was "effectively wild."	Marlins manager Edwin Rodriguez said Johnson is "amazing" but hasn't reached his peak.	"He's still learning. He's still getting better and better," Rodriguez said. "We haven't seen the best of J.J. That's my opinion. I think this year and next year and years to come, he's going to be the best pitcher in baseball. I can see that coming."	Freeman doubled down the line past third baseman Greg Dobbs. Rodriguez immediately went out to pull his ace after 109 pitches.	Rodriguez said he began worrying in the middle innings about Johnson's pitch count. He said he asked Johnson in the seventh inning if he wanted to keep pitching.	"He said, 'I'm here for the team,'" Rodriguez said.	Would Johnson have remained in the game for the ninth if he still had the no-hitter?	"I would say yes," Rodriguez said, before adding his decision would have been based on the effort Johnson needed to finish the eighth.	Freeman's hit relieved Rodriguez of a potentially difficult decision.	Chipper Jones homered in the ninth off Randy Choate for the Braves' only other hit. The home run gave Jones 1,500 RBIs for his career.	Johnson came close to a no-hitter in the Marlins' opener, blanking the Mets until Willie Harris led off the seventh inning with a double.	Jones predicted Johnson's no-hitter will come.	"That guy is some kind of kid," Jones said. "He's going to have his day. I'm just glad it wasn't today."	Johnson surprised Jones and the Braves with his new curveball. Jones was happy to take a first-inning walk when he had his first look at the new pitch.	"I thought, 'Oh, OK, he's got a curveball now,'" Jones said. "I hope he doesn't throw that to me too many times."	Braves first-year manager Fredi Gonzalez, who managed the Marlins for 3½ seasons, was also impressed with Johnson's new look.	"He threw in a different wrinkle from what I've seen," Gonzalez said. "That's a sign of a good pitcher.	"He's gotten himself into a class, when you start naming top right-handers, he's up there," he said.	Johnson said a no-hitter "isn't one of my goals" but added "if it happens, it's really special."	After taking a no-hitter into the seventh in his first start, the two-time All-Star, who led the NL in ERA last year, came even closer this time. With his pitch count rising, Johnson needed only eight pitches to retire the Braves in order in the seventh.	Martin Prado grounded back to Johnson to open the eighth before Freeman's double.	Johnson was trying for Florida's first no-hitter since Anibal Sanchez threw one against the Arizona Diamondbacks on Sept. 6, 2006. Al Leiter, Kevin Brown and A.J. Burnett have also pitched no-hitters for Florida.	Chris Coghlan had three hits, including a two-run single in a three-run second. Johnson contributed an RBI single and Logan Morrison hit his third homer.	Tim Hudson (2-1) gave up seven hits and five runs in six innings.	Attendance was 14,351, one day after the series opener drew only 13,856, the smallest in Turner Field history.	The Braves avoided being held hitless only a few days away from the one-year anniversary of Ubaldo Jimenez's no-hitter at Turner Field on April 17, 2010, in a 4-0 Colorado Rockies win.	Coghlan led off the night with his team-leading sixth double but the Marlins didn't have another two-base hit, ending their streak of at least two doubles in 10 straight games.	Hanley Ramirez drove in Coghlan with a single up the middle. Coghlan added a two-run single in the second after Johnson drove in a run with a single, a hit that came after John Buck was intentionally walked to load the bases.	Morrison's homer in the third pushed the lead to 5-0.	The Braves' only baserunners through seven innings were walks by Jones in the first, Brian McCann in the fourth and Nate McLouth in the sixth.	Game notes	 Jones became only the third switch-hitter with 1,500 RBIs, joining Eddie Murray (1,917) and Mickey Mantle (1,509). ... Jones took a called third strike to end the sixth for his first strikeout of the season. ... Coghlan hit a single in the seventh and, trying for his second double of the game, was thrown out at second by Prado from left field.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK --  Every time they give him something to hit, Troy Tulowitzki is making the Mets pay.	Tulowitzki sliced a go-ahead homer through the thick fog and the Colorado Rockies, off to the best start in club history, beat New York 5-4 on Wednesday night for their fourth consecutive victory -- all on the road.	"Last year we weren't very good in one-run games and we've won a couple this year," Tulowitzki said. "We're a good team. We believe that. We feel like at least so far that even when we're down we are going to find a way to win."	Ryan Spilborghs also connected and Esmil Rogers (2-0) won his second straight outing to begin the season. The NL West leaders improved to 8-2, with the only losses coming in extra innings.	The Rockies, who opened 7-3 in 1995 and '97, are 5-1 away from Coors Field after going 31-50 on the road last year.	"It's a very good game to win. It's also a very good game to come back in considering the conditions we were dealing with tonight," manager Jim Tracy said.	Tulowitzki foiled the Mets with his bat and glove in the series opener Monday night, then burned them again Wednesday when they pitched to him with first base open in a key spot. He hit a three-run shot off Jonathon Niese (0-2) in the fifth inning to give Colorado a 4-3 lead.	The slugger also doubled and singled, meaning eight of his 11 hits this season have gone for extra bases. He is 5 for 8 in the series with six RBIs.	"Big stage, you know?" Tulowitzki said. "They were all over me by my third at-bat. That's fun. And you know, I think also here, there a lot of people here, obviously you want to play well here for the All-Star votes. Things like that, the fans remember that. They're good baseball people."	Carlos Beltran and Daniel Murphy each had an RBI double for the Mets (4-7), who have dropped six of seven following a three-game winning streak. First-year manager Terry Collins held a quick, closed-door meeting after the game and made it clear what he expects.	"It's time to start making pitches. It's time to start getting the big two-out hit," said Collins, who thought his team got deflated after Tulowitzki's home run. "Now is the time.	"We've been in every game and we've got to start winning 'em," he added. "We're one pitch away and we're one swing away from being 9-2, and we're not. But the next 11 we need to be 9-2. We need to get it going and do the things we haven't done so far."	The Mets and Rockies will play three games in a 24-hour span -- a rainout Tuesday night forced Thursday's traditional doubleheader, which begins at 12:10 p.m.	The weather was only slightly better Wednesday, when players could see their own breath on a gloomy, misty, 49-degree night that felt more like Victorian London than New York City.	After throwing 7 1/3 strong innings to win 7-1 at Pittsburgh last Thursday, Rogers lasted 5 2/3 innings this time. He gave up three runs and seven hits before four relievers finished up.	Huston Street tossed a perfect ninth for his sixth save in six chances.	Carlos Gonzalez made a diving catch in left field to save a run in the first for the Rockies.	Seth Smith drew a one-out walk in the fifth, Jonathan Herrera singled and Gonzalez's slow groundout left runners at second and third. With first base open, the Mets had a chance to walk Tulowitzki and instead face Jose Lopez with the bases loaded, but Collins chose not to.	"At that particular point in the game it's pretty easy to start walking guys, setting up big innings," he said.	Tulowitzki reached for an 0-1 pitch that appeared to be outside and punched a slicing shot into the right-field corner. His fifth home run of the season, and second in the past two games at spacious Citi Field, put Colorado ahead 4-3.	"He put a good swing on it on a pretty good pitch, I thought," said Niese, adding that he wanted to go after Tulowitzki. "It was off the plate. Just one of those pitches where you've just got to tip your cap and move on."	The All-Star shortstop hit a two-run shot with first base open in the eighth inning Monday night, giving the Rockies a three-run cushion in a 7-6 victory. He also made an outstanding defensive play to preserve a seventh-inning tie in that game.	Spilborghs added a solo shot off Niese in the sixth, his first of the season. New York cut it to 5-4 on Angel Pagan's sacrifice fly in the seventh.	The Mets intentionally walked Tulowitzki with first base open in the ninth and got out of the inning unscathed.	Tulowitzki doubled in the fourth and scored on Todd Helton's single.	Game notes	 RHP Greg Reynolds is set to start the opener for Colorado on Thursday and LHP Jorge De La Rosa will go in the second game. RHP R.A. Dickey and LHP Chris Capuano will pitch for New York. ... Mets RHP Chris Young has tendinitis in his surgically repaired arm and his next scheduled start has been pushed back two days until Sunday. New York plans to bring RHP D.J. Carrasco out of the bullpen for a spot start in Atlanta on Friday night. Carrasco worked a scoreless ninth inning Wednesday night.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

HOUSTON --  Carlos Zambrano brushed off the idea that his bad sixth inning on the mound Wednesday night was a result of being worked up after his home run in the top half of the frame.	Zambrano extended a franchise record with his 22nd career homer and ran his winning streak to 10 games, leading the Chicago Cubs to a 9-5 victory and a series win over the Houston Astros.	"It's not the first time that I hit a home run," he said. "It's number 22 for me. I've been excited 22 times."	Alfonso Soriano's home run off Wandy Rodriguez (0-2) capped a five-run first inning for the Cubs. Zambrano's homer -- his sixth against the Astros -- made it 6-0 in the sixth.	Zambrano (2-0) pitched five scoreless innings before the Astros jumped on him for five runs in the sixth. Carlos Lee, Brett Wallace and Bill Hall each drove in a run in the inning before Matt Downs hit a two-run homer to cut the deficit to 6-5.	"I just left some pitches in the middle and got crushed," he said. "That happens. The most important thing is we won the game today."	Chicago got three insurance runs on three hits off Wilton Lopez in the ninth.	Zambrano allowed seven hits and walked three in 5 2/3 innings to extend a winning streak that began last season. Marcos Mateo, Sean Marshall, Kerry Wood and Carlos Marmol combined to pitch 3 1/3 scoreless innings to close it out.	Manager Mike Quade was impressed with the work of his bullpen.	"There are a lot of reasons you win and lose ball games, so there were more reasons for us to win tonight because the club picked up Z," Quade said of Zambrano.	Rodriguez allowed five runs -- all in the first inning -- and nine hits in five innings.	"Wandy is so good and has done such a good job in this ballpark, even last year with throwing the ball," manager Brad Mills said. "To give up those two-out runs, his stuff is so good and he's done such a good job, it's a little bit of a shock."	Jeff Baker drove in two runs with a double to right field in the first inning. Soriano's two-out, three-run shot to the Crawford Boxes in left field made it 5-0.	"I made one mistake. I threw a lot of fastballs to Soriano," Rodriguez said. "I was throwing him inside. I needed to throw another pitch in that situation."	Starlin Castro singled with one out in the ninth before stealing second base and scoring on a double by Darwin Barney. Marlon Byrd reached and got to third base, and Barney scored on a throwing error by Lopez. A single by Aramis Ramirez scored Byrd and chased Lopez.	Rodriguez gave up three straight singles in the third inning to load the bases. His defense helped him out by turning a double play, and he struck out Tyler Colvin to end the inning.	Rodriguez was replaced by Fernando Abad, who gave up the homer to Zambrano, to start the sixth inning.	Lee's RBI single came after a walk by Michael Bourn and a single by Angel Sanchez to make it 6-1. Sanchez's single came on a soft grounder down the third-base line that Ramirez watched roll outside the foul line before bouncing back fair just as Sanchez reached first base.	Wallace pulled Houston to 6-2 with his run-scoring single to center field. Hall drove in a run on a forceout to make it 6-3 before the homer by Downs. Wallace was thrown out on that play when he started toward second, but he stopped before Barney dropped Hall's fly ball.	Downs homered before a walk by J.R. Towles chased Zambrano, who was replaced by Mateo.	Zambrano was already to the grass when Quade met him to get the ball as he left the game. Zambrano said he didn't realize Quade was so far from him when he took off and regretted walking that far from the mound.	He doesn't want this incident to make people think he's reverting to his problem-filled past that included being put on the suspended list last season after a dugout tirade.	"I went to the office after the game and I apologized to Mike," he said. "I didn't mean nothing. Believe me. The last thing that I want to do this year is disrespect the manager. I've never had a problem with a manager. It was my mistake. Next time I will wait more. In fact, I will wait for the reliever too so there's no problem."	Quade didn't feel like the placement of the handoff was a big deal.	"I didn't get there quick enough," Quade said with a laugh. "He was ready to go. I guess I should have been sprinting there. Hand me the ball, just don't drop the ball. I don't really care. I was hoping he wouldn't run me over. There's a certain amount of respect and stuff that goes with some of that but to me it's just give me the ball."	Game notes	 Chicago OF Kosuke Fukudome was out of the lineup for the third straight day after straining his hamstring making a catch on Sunday. He is listed as day-to-day and the Cubs are optimistic he will be able to play by Friday and won't have to go on the disabled list. ... Houston 3B Chris Johnson was out of the lineup after being hit in the arm with a pitch a day before. Johnson said his arm was sore and swollen but that he should be able to play on Thursday. ... Several Astros, including Hunter Pence and Johnson along with manager Brad Mills, attended a lunch hosted by President George H.W. Bush and his wife Barbara on Wednesday. The former president chooses a handful of players and staff each season to attend the event.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PHOENIX --  Lance Berkman is showing he still can swing the bat.	Berkman hit a grand slam for his fourth home run in three games and drove in five runs, and the St. Louis Cardinals routed the Arizona Diamondbacks 15-5 on Wednesday night.	"You always feel like you can do it," Berkman said, "but obviously it's good to prove it to everyone and also to yourself."	Skip Schumaker also homered, Albert Pujols was 2 for 3 with two RBIs, and Cody Rasmus and Gerald Laird each had three hits for the Cardinals, who got their first series win this season.	Every St. Louis starter except Matt Holliday had at least one hit.	"We're not going to score 15 runs every night but we were swinging the bats like we were capable of," Berkman said. "We have the potential to have an explosive offense."	The Cardinals, who scored 15 runs for the first time since an 18-3 victory against Atlanta on August 22, 2008, have won three of four.	"We won the series," said St. Louis manager Tony LaRussa. "It's our first one and that's important. That's our goal."	Jake Westbrook (1-1) earned the win, allowing five runs -- two earned -- on nine hits in 5 2/3 innings with two walks and three strikeouts.	"Pitching with a lead, especially one that big, it's not as easy as it seems," Westbrook said. "You can't throw down the middle and you can't walk guys because walking guys can lead to a big inning. You have to be aggressive but you can't go down the middle."	Arizona starter Ian Kennedy (1-1) lasted only three innings, his shortest outing as a starter in more than two years, allowing nine runs on seven hits with two walks and two hit batters.	"I was off on pretty much everything," Kennedy said. "The command, the curveball was getting over but nothing else was getting over. I was really battling against myself. It was pretty bad. This is by far the worst outing I've had in a long time."	Russell Branyan hit his first home run for the Diamondbacks, who gave up their most runs since a 17-3 loss to Milwaukee on May 8 last season.	"It is tough to be in a game like that but they kept battling," said Arizona manager Kirk Gibson. "It was a lot to make up. I've played in several games like that and you can push yourself as much as you want. It's frustrating. It's disappointing."	The Cardinals struck early against Kennedy, scoring two in the first and six more in the second when his control largely disappeared.	Laird beat out a grounder deep in the hole at short and Kennedy hit Ryan Theriot with a pitch. Rasmus doubled down the right-field line, scoring both runners to make it 4-0.	Kennedy walked Pujols and hit Holliday to load the bases ahead of Berkman, who hit his fourth home run of the season into the left-field bleachers to put St. Louis ahead 8-0.	Westbrook added his first RBI of the season in the third, looping a double down the left-field line to score Laird after the catcher had doubled to right.	Schumaker stretched the lead to 12-0 with a three-run homer, his first, just over the fence into the pool area in right-center field.	Branyan hit a two-run, opposite-field home run in the fourth to cut the lead to 12-2, but Pujols hit a two-run single and David Freese added an RBI hit in the top of the fifth against Aaron Heilman.	During the series, the Cardinals moved into fourth in the National League in runs scored.	"It's hard to make any judgments based on a week's worth of baseball," Berkman said. "You have to let things play out week after week."	Arizona added three more unearned runs in the fifth off Westbrook.	Game notes	 Kennedy lasted only two innings on August 8, 2008, in Anaheim while pitching for the New York Yankees. ... Both dugouts were warned after Kennedy hit Holliday on the hand with a high, inside fastball. ... Westbrook has three RBIs in 45 career at-bats. ... Laird was starting in place of Yadier Molina, who is hitting .152 (5 for 33) with three RBIs and only two extra-base hits. ... The Diamondbacks optioned Kam Mickolio to Triple-A Reno before the game and recalled RHP Esmerling Vasquez. Mickolio allowed three runs on four hits in 2/3 of an inning on Tuesday. ... Before the game, the Cardinals placed RHP Bryan Augenstein and LHP Brian Tallet on the 15-day disabled list. Both were injured in the Cardinals' 13-8 loss to Arizona on Tuesday. Augenstein strained his right groin and Tallet fractured a bone in his right hand when he got rangled up with Stephen Drew on a play at first. St. Louis recalled RHP Fernando Salas and RHP Eduardo Sanchez from Triple-A Memphis. Sanchez made his major-league debut when he came on to pitch the eighth.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN FRANCISCO --  The Giants came from behind to win four times during their season-opening homestand -- and all by one run. For San Francisco, it's not far off from the style of play so familiar during last season's special run.	With all the World Series fanfare finally done, the Giants are ready to get in a groove.	Pablo Sandoval hit a tying solo home run in the sixth inning and last-minute fill-in Mike Fontenot connected two batters later, leading San Francisco past the Los Angeles Dodgers 4-3 on Wednesday night for a series win.	"It's huge to come back and get a series," said manager Bruce Bochy, whose club lost Monday's opener 6-1. "That's two series in a row we've gotten here."	Fontenot's two-out drive to the arcade in right-center off Ted Lilly (0-2) just did it for winning pitcher Jonathan Sanchez, who struck out a season-best nine in six innings. Sanchez has 24 K's over his first three starts.	Aaron Miles had a go-ahead RBI double in the top of the sixth among his three hits for his first multihit game of 2011, but the Dodgers' 3-2 lead didn't last long.	Sanchez (1-1) remained poised after allowing a two-run homer to Rod Barajas in the fourth that tied the game at 2.	It was Barajas' third homer of the year and second in this three-game series the Giants won.	Sanchez is 5-2 with a 1.64 ERA and 72 strikeouts since Aug. 30. A 13-game winner in 2010, the 28-year-old lefty is also 3-1 with a 2.10 ERA and 38 strikeouts and six walks over his past four outings against Los Angeles.	Closer Brian Wilson pitched a perfect ninth for the second straight night for his second save in three chances. San Francisco (6-6) has played six one-run games already, going 4-2.	"We had a lot of those last year. They used the word torture," Fontenot said. "It's good to get some wins like that."	Sandoval -- back to his slugging self after a rigorous offseason in which he dropped nearly 40 pounds -- and Fontenot were the catalysts with their power on a day home run king Barry Bonds was convicted across town of obstruction of justice stemming from December 2003 testimony to a grand jury that he never knowingly took steroids or performance-enhancing drugs.	Fontenot, who had all of about 10 minutes' warning he was going to start, hit his first home run as a Giant after being acquired in a trade with the Chicago Cubs last August. He was added to the starting lineup just before first pitch at second base in place of Mark DeRosa, who experienced soreness in his surgically repaired left wrist and was held out as a precaution. He had been set to play for starter Freddy Sanchez, kept out to rest his surgically repaired, non-throwing left shoulder.	Fontenot's previous homer came May 7 last year for the Cubs. He also hit an RBI double in the second Wednesday for his first hit of the year, snapping an 0-for-9 start.	"I was thinking about that, wondering if all the starting pitchers were going to get a hit before I was," he said. "I'm in here and ready. ... Sometimes that's how it happens."	San Francisco took two of three in this series after the Dodgers won two of three when the teams opened the season. The Giants now hit the road for 16 of their next 19 games, beginning Friday at Arizona following an off day Thursday.	This emotional series between the longtime rivals remained pretty tame after Monday's opener began with a joint on-field message of sportsmanship, respect and nonviolence by San Francisco's Jeremy Affeldt and Jamey Carroll of the Dodgers. Longtime Giants fan Bryan Stow was severely beaten outside Dodger Stadium on March 31 after the teams' season opener and is hospitalized in Los Angeles in a medically induced coma.	Lilly generated a warning for both benches after he hit reigning Rookie of the Year Buster Posey with pitches in the first inning and again in the third. On Tuesday night, Giants ace Tim Lincecum plunked former teammate Juan Uribe for the second time this year -- a day after Uribe received his World Series ring in an on-field ceremony.	"I think he's one of the better hitters in the league at hitting the ball over the plate and driving the ball the other way," Lilly said. "For the most part, I've got to stay hard in on his hands. I've missed out over the plate before and he's hit it pretty hard, so I think if I'm going to miss on him that's where I want to do it."	Posey didn't do any finger pointing but manager Bruce Bochy wasn't happy.	"You get your cleanup hitter hit twice, I don't think any club would like it, and we didn't," the skipper said.	After Posey went to first in the third inning, he stole his first career base. He had one steal during last year's playoffs but it doesn't count toward his official statistics.	Lilly was booed when he stepped into the batter's box to hit in the fourth. He allowed four runs on seven hits in six innings, struck out two and didn't walk a batter.	Andre Ethier singled in the seventh for the Dodgers, giving him a 10-game hitting streak.	Casey Blake returned to Los Angeles' lineup after missing three games with a bruised thigh but played first base rather than his regular spot at third as manager Don Mattingly gave the struggling James Loney a night off.	Game notes	 San Francisco CF Andres Torres, nursing a strained left Achilles tendon he hurt Saturday vs. St. Louis, hit in the cage and will push himself harder Friday. He could play Saturday. ... The Giants drew 42,060 to sell out for the sixth straight time this year and they have 16 consecutive sellouts dating back to the final regular-season series against San Diego that began Oct. 1. That includes seven postseason games. ... Dodgers RHP Vicente Padilla, who underwent surgery on his pitching elbow Feb. 24, played catch on flat ground and is slated to throw off a mound Thursday or Friday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK --  Carlos Gonzalez and hot-hitting Troy Tulowitzki belted back-to-back home runs, and the Colorado Rockies survived a shaky ninth inning to beat the New York Mets 6-5 in the opener of a doubleheader Thursday.	The Rockies (9-2), off to the best start in franchise history, won their fourth consecutive one-run game. They were going for a four-game series sweep in Game 2, which was postponed from Tuesday night because of rain.	Colorado had a three-run lead in the ninth when Huston Street came on to close it out. He gave up a two-run homer to Scott Hairston, a walk to Josh Thole and a single to pinch hitter Carlos Beltran before manager Jim Tracy brought in Matt Lindstrom.	The big right-hander got Jose Reyes to ground into a fielder's choice, then walked Daniel Murphy to load the bases for David Wright, who flied out to the warning track in right field to end the game.	Greg Reynolds (1-0) lasted five innings to earn his first win since June 17, 2008.	Tulowitzki terrorized the Mets again with three hits, including his league-leading sixth home run, and is 8 for 12 in the series. The sweet-swinging shortstop has driven in seven runs against New York, with the go-ahead three-run shot Wednesday night.	Right-hander R.A. Dickey (1-2) struggled with his knuckleball, allowing five runs and eight hits in 6 1/3 innings, as the Mets lost their fourth straight game.	Reyes hit his first homer of the season, a solo shot in the eighth inning.	New York took the lead in the fourth on a sacrifice fly by Angel Pagan and a two-out RBI single by Hairston, before the Rockies got one back in the fifth.	Jose Morales singled leading off and went to second on a sacrifice bunt. Dexter Fowler then tagged a pitch deep to center that Pagan appeared to lose in the sun. It bounced off the wall to put runners on first and third, and Seth Smith followed with an RBI groundout to make it 2-1.	The Rockies pulled ahead in the sixth on another outfield miscue.	Tulowitzki led off with a base hit. Jason Giambi then drew a full-count walk before Jose Lopez grounded into a fielder's choice that cut down Tulowitzki at third. Morales came to the plate and hit a fly ball to right field that Hairston simply stopped chasing.	It wasn't clear whether he lost it in the sky or thought it was gone.	Either way, the ball hopped once off the warning track and again off the wall, allowing both runners to score and giving the Rockies a 3-2 lead.	Yet another outfield blunder came in the seventh, when Harris' error on a double by Smith allowed him to coast into third base. Gonzalez followed by driving a 2-2 pitch from Dickey into the right-field seats for his first homer of the season, and Tulowitzki made it back-to-back shots when he connected off reliever Bobby Parnell moments later.	The comedy of errors wasn't limited to the Mets, though they were the most costly.	Gonzalez slipped and fell on his butt after losing a fly ball to left in the first inning, and Colorado reliever Franklin Morales lost his right shoe while covering first base when Harris stepped on his foot running out a ground ball in the sixth.	Morales limped off the field without throwing another pitch.	Game notes	 Mets RHP Chris Young (right biceps tendinitis) threw a bullpen session before the game. His start Friday in Atlanta has been pushed back to Sunday. ... Rockies RHP Ubaldo Jimenez (right thumb) hit the mid-90s against Oakland minor leaguers Wednesday. He remains on schedule to start Monday against San Francisco.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

NEW YORK --  The thing that Troy Tulowitzki loves most about the Colorado Rockies is that nobody is hung up on individual statistics. So long as the team wins, everybody is happy.	They've been winning a whole lot lately.	The numbers Tulowitzki is putting up have a lot to do with it.	The sweet-swinging shortstop clobbered home runs in each game of a doubleheader Thursday and the Rockies wrapped up a four-game sweep of the New York Mets in style. They won the opener 6-5, hanging on through a wild ninth inning, before taking the second game 9-4.	"A lot of times you can come on the road, you get down late -- sixth, seventh inning -- and you shut it down, get ready to go home," Tulowitzki said. "This team doesn't do that at all.	"We're a bunch of guys who don't quit," he said. "I'll take that over a more talented team that cares about individual stats and things like that any day."	Ironically, stats are the best way to describe the stellar series Tulowitzki just had.	He went 10-for-16 with eight RBIs, homering in each of the four games against New York. The 26-year-old also scored five times and drew four walks against balky Mets pitching.	"Am I shocked by it? No," Rockies manager Jim Tracy said. "When he gets hot, he's a very, very dangerous player."	And the Rockies are a very dangerous team.	Off to its best start in franchise history, Colorado (10-2) has won five straight and 10 of 11 overall, the lone defeat coming against the Pittsburgh Pirates in extra innings.	Meanwhile, the Mets (4-9) have lost five straight and eight of nine.	"Depressing," manager Terry Collins said. "We're better than this and we'll play better than this. I still believe we're going to straighten this out."	Greg Reynolds (1-0) won Game 1 despite a couple shaky innings, and Jorge De La Rosa (2-0) held on long enough in the second game for the Rockies' offense to deliver his win.	The Rockies spotted the Mets 2-0 leads in both games -- in fact, New York has scored first in six straight games while winning just once -- before pouring it on.	In the opener, Seth Smith got Colorado within 2-1 with an RBI in the fifth, and the Rockies went ahead for good in the sixth. Scott Hairston inexplicably stopped chasing Jose Morales' fly ball to right, letting it bounce off the warning track for a two-run double.	Colorado added three more runs in the seventh when Carlos Gonzalez drove a 2-2 pitch from R.A. Dickey (1-2) into the right-field seats for his first home run of the year. Tulowitzki followed the two-run shot with a homer of his own off Bobby Parnell.	Jose Reyes homered for the Mets in the eighth, making it 6-3, and Huston Street came on in the ninth to close things out. He gave up a two-run shot to Hairston, a walk to Josh Thole and a single to pinch-hitter Carlos Beltran before Matt Lindstrom came in from the bullpen.	He got Reyes to ground into a fielder's choice and then walked Daniel Murphy to load the bases for David Wright, who flied out to the warning track in right field to end the game.	Game 2 didn't have nearly as much drama.	New York again took a 2-0 lead on the first career RBIs for longtime minor leaguer Mike Nickeas, after a strange play in which a fan hanging over the railing appeared to touch a drive by Hairston that hit off the orange line on the fence that marks a home run. The umpire crew ruled the play a double and then upheld the decision after watching a video replay.	Nickeas cleared the bases anyway with his double moments later.	The Rockies tied it in the third on Dexter Fowler's RBI single and Gonzalez's run-scoring grounder, and the Mets pulled back ahead in the fourth on Reyes' two-run single.	Tulowitzki led off the sixth with a solo shot to left, Todd Helton added a one-out single and Ryan Spilborghs singled to right on a ball Beltran misplayed. Iannetta walked to load the bases for De La Rosa, who chopped a grounder to Brad Emaus at second. He fumbled the play and could only get the runner at second, allowing Helton to score and the inning to continue.	The miscue, one of several by the Mets' defense, proved costly.	Fowler lashed a single through the left side to give Colorado a 5-4 lead and knock Chris Capuano (1-1) from the game. Taylor Buchholz then served up a plum pitch to Jonathan Herrera, who hit a three-run homer to right field, the second of his career.	The Rockies added another run off Francisco Rodriguez in the ninth inning.	"They're swinging the hot bats right now, especially Tulowitzki," Capuano said. "He's covering both sides of the plate pretty well."	Game notes	 The Rockies optioned Reynolds to Triple-A Colorado Springs and purchased the contract of right-hander Alan Johnson between games. They also transferred Aaron Cook to the 60-day DL. ... Mets right-hander Chris Young (right biceps tendinitis) threw a bullpen session before the game. His start Friday in Atlanta has been pushed back to Sunday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Johnny Damon circled the bases and disappeared into a pack of teammates waiting at home plate to celebrate the Tampa Bay Rays' first home win of the season.	The Rays rallied in dramatic fashion to beat the Minnesota Twins 4-3 in extra innings Thursday night, scoring twice to tie it in the ninth and overcoming another deficit in the 10th to win on Damon's one-out, two-run homer that barely cleared the wall in right field to give the struggling defending AL East champions their third straight win.	"It's nice to see them celebrating. ... We needed something like that to really get us going," said manager Joe Maddon, whose sputtering offense entered the ninth with just four hits off Twins starter Carl Pavano. "The primary reason we've been struggling has been hitting. So when hitting comes through in the end like that to pick us up, that's nice."	Pavano pitched eight shutout innings but was denied the victory when Minnesota closer Joe Nathan gave up a two-run double to Matt Joyce in the ninth.	The Twins regained the lead in the 10th on Danny Valencia's RBI single off Kyle Farnsworth (1-0), however once again the bullpen couldn't finish off the Rays.	Sam Fuld singled with one out in the Tampa Bay 10th off Matt Capps (1-1) and Damon -- settling into a role as the Rays' primary designated hitter following Manny Ramirez's sudden retirement -- followed with his third homer of the season, driving the ball into the first row of the right-field seats.	Twins manager Ron Gardenhire tried to keep the late collapse in perspective. Afterward, he also revealed the Twins have lost All-Star catcher Joe Mauer to the disabled list because of weakness in his legs.	"You just keep playing. It's part of the game. It does happen. Got two pretty good arms out there that can finish games and tonight it just didn't work out," Gardenhire said.	"We've have to keep battling. We're doing better. We're swinging the bats. We had plenty of chances and we missed a lot of opportunities to score more runs. That's probably where the game was lost more than anything else," he said.	A season-low crowd of 10,042 at Tropicana Field cheered Damon all around the bases. The Rays danced and pranced back to the clubhouse, where the celebration continued.	"Going up to that last at-bat, I'm 0-for-4 in the game and really couldn't do anything off Pavano. But you learn how to forget about it," Damon said. "You learn how to be in the moment, and that's what I did. It wasn't that bad of a pitch by Capps. Fortunately I got enough of it."	Delmon Young and Drew Butera drove in sixth-inning runs for the Twins, seemingly supplying all the offensive support Pavano needed.	Pavano struck out seven and walked two. He held the Rays hitless until Joyce singled with one out in the fifth, and the 35-year-old right-hander stranded runners at third base in the sixth and seventh innings.	The Twins scored twice off Rays starter James Shields. Justin Morneau doubled and Jim Thome singled to begin the inning. Young followed with a sacrifice fly, and Butera made it 2-0 with a bases-loaded single for his first RBI of the season.	Felipe Lopez began Tampa Bay's ninth-inning rally with a one-out bloop double off Nathan. Ben Zobrist then walked and Joyce drove his third hit of the game into the gap in right to tie it.	Shields and Pavano helped themselves remain in a scoreless duel by picking runners off base in the fifth. Shields caught Alexi Casilla too far off first base before Minnesota's Denard Span doubled to the center-field wall in the top half of the inning. With two runners on, Pavano countered by picking Joyce off second.	Pavano worked out of another tight spot in the sixth when Fuld singled and eventually was stranded at third when B.J. Upton struck out.	Gardenhire turned to the bullpen when Pavano told him he was tired after throwing 104 pitches.	"He said he'd love to be a hero tonight, but he was gassed. ... That's all you can ask from your starting pitcher," the Minnesota manager said.	Game notes	 Following the game, Mauer was placed on the 15-day DL because of what Gardenhire described as "bilateral leg weakness," which is causing soreness in the three-time AL batting champion's hips. ... Maddon said third baseman Evan Longoria's strained left oblique muscle is improving but there still is no definitive timetable for him to begin rehabbing the injury. The three-time All-Star, out since April 3, is expected to be sidelined a minimum of three weeks.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

NEW YORK --  Joba Chamberlain parked his 240-pound frame in front of home plate and waited for Russell Martin's toss from near the backstop. Felix Pie, at a lithe 185 pounds, tried to twist around the Yankees reliever for an insurance run.	No chance. The big Nebraskan wouldn't budge.	Chamberlain's block of the plate in the eighth kept the Yankees within a run of the Orioles, and New York's bats did the rest to complete a comeback from five runs down to beat Baltimore 6-5 in 10 innings Thursday night to sweep the rain-shortened series.	"That was just Joba getting in the way," Martin said. "Joba's going to win that every time."	Nick Swisher hit a sacrifice fly in the 10th off Michael Gonzalez (0-1) to earn the season's first pie in the face for a game-ending hit, and Jorge Posada tied it in the ninth with his fifth homer of the season off Orioles closer Kevin Gregg.	Gonzalez walked Mark Teixeira and gave up a double to Alex Rodriguez to start the 10th. After Robinson Cano lined out to a drawn-in shortstop, Swisher hit a fly and Teixeira easily beat right fielder Nick Markakis' throw home.	"Our guys kept kinda chippin' away, and then we get the big homer from Jorge in the ninth and then the walk to Tex and the double by Alex to start the inning off," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "But our guys have the ability to do that."	Mariano Rivera (1-0) gave up a leadoff single in the 10th, but Derrek Lee grounded into a double play and Vladimir Guerrero grounded out.	Chamberlain relieved Bartolo Colon in the eighth inning with runners on first and third. Chamberlain threw a pitch in the dirt that went to the backstop, and the ball took a long bounce off the wall as Martin went to retrieve it.	Martin made an easy toss to Chamberlain, who turned sideways and shielded Pie, a pinch-runner, from reaching the plate. Pie made a standup slide rather than going all the way down and thought he was safe. Orioles manager Buck Showalter came out to argue, but replays clearly showed Chamberlain made the tag in time.	"I knew the ball come back quick. I tried to change my position for putting my hand" on the plate, Pie said. "It doesn't matter if he's big ... That's part of the game. I'm not scared."	Gregg's meltdown spoiled a solid six-inning effort by Jake Arrieta and handed the Orioles their fourth straight loss after a 6-1 start. Baltimore built its early lead against Phil Hughes, who struggled once again.	"We're not going to dwell in self-pity," Showalter said. "We pitched well and did a lot of good things out there tonight. We just have to keep grinding and move on."	Rodriguez, who went 3 for 3, doubled in the fifth for New York's first hit against Arrieta and Cano followed with a double to pull New York to 5-1.	Teixeira hit an RBI double and Rodriguez added a sacrifice fly in the sixth. Martin had a run-scoring grounder off reliever Jason Berken in the seventh to make it a one-run game.	The win ended a more than 10-hour day of big league baseball in New York. The Mets were swept by Colorado in a doubleheader at Citi Field that started at 12:20 p.m. and ended just after this game started.	Struggling with low velocity on his fastball, Hughes lasted just 4 1/3 innings after going only two innings against Boston in his last start and four in his first start of the season.	He reached 92 mph twice in the first inning but was throwing consistently in the 88-89 mph range after the second. Girardi said location was more important than speed. On Markakis' two-run homer in the third, the pitch -- an 86 mph cutter -- was way off Martin's target.	"I don't have the magic potion or the answers. Hopefully it will work itself out," Hughes said. "I'm really proud of the guys, battling back after really digging us a hole there."	In the fourth, Luke Scott doubled and scored on Mark Reynolds' drive that Curtis Granderson caught leaping into the wall in right-center for a 3-0 lead.	Swisher crashed into the wall in right field catching a fly ball in the fourth, one batter before Markakis lined an RBI double to right, ending Hughes' night.	Colon relieved and gave up an RBI single to Guerrero for a 5-0 lead.	Arrieta came in 2-0 with a 3.65 ERA against the Yankees. He bounced back from his last start, when he took a pounding from the potent Texas Rangers (3 1/3 innings, eight runs). Arrieta gave up three runs and five hits.	Game notes	Kevin Millwood, who signed a minor league deal with New York on March 25, is scheduled to pitch for Double-A Trenton on Sunday. ... The Orioles have lost 20 of 24 games in the Bronx since July 30, 2008.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

WASHINGTON --  Consider the past two games Exhibits 1 and 1A for why the Philadelphia Phillies assembled their ace-after-ace starting rotation.	Cliff Lee produced a 12-strikeout, three-hit shutout in a 4-0 victory over the Washington Nationals on Thursday night, a day after Roy Halladay went nine innings to win, too, giving the Phillies consecutive complete games for the first time since 1999.	"I want to throw nine innings every time I take the mound. That's that," said Lee (2-1), who walked one batter and went to three-ball counts on only two others. "I hope Roy does it every day before me, too, but that's what I'm going to try to do. Just because he threw a complete game it isn't like, 'Oh, I've got to do that, too.'"	Pretty nice when it works out that way, though, especially in this age of protected arms, scrutinized pitch counts and relief specialists.	"I want to be a guy who throws complete games every time," Lee said. "That's not really realistic, but going into each game, that's what I'm trying to do."	Lee didn't come close his previous time on a mound, at Atlanta last Friday, when he allowed six runs and 10 hits in 3 1/3 innings -- his shortest start since Sept. 4, 2009.	But he was back at his best against Washington, fooling hitters with darting fastballs across the black of the plate, sweeping changeups in the dirt and plenty of other right-where-he-wanted-them pitches.	Lee faced 30 batters, three over the minimum, while recording his 21st complete game and sixth shutout. He fell one strikeout shy of his career high.	"Got sharper as the game went on," Nationals manager Jim Riggleman said. "And I think the called strikeouts is an indication that he's hitting some spots that you just don't feel like you can do much with the pitch, but it's a strike. It just kind of ties you up."	Nationals leadoff hitter Ian Desmond went 0-for-4 with three strikeouts. His take on Lee?	"He controls the zone. He's working in and out. He's changing his speeds. He just throws strikes," Desmond said. "And he works quick. He doesn't really let you get too comfortable."	It's rare that a guy can be perfect through five innings and not come close to being the evening's best pitcher -- yet that's exactly what happened to Jordan Zimmermann (1-2).	Less than 20 months removed from reconstructive elbow surgery, Washington's right-hander matched zeros with Lee early. He retired Philadelphia's first 15 batters, but the 16th, Carlos Ruiz, drove an 0-1 curveball barely over the wall in left for a homer.	"Only mistake I made all night," Zimmermann said.	Two outs later, the Phillies delivered a second hit, a double by Shane Victorino, and he scored when fill-in third baseman Jerry Hairston Jr. wildly threw away the ball for an error.	That would be enough offense to back Lee, who was close to unhittable on a nice spring night, when the temperature at first pitch was 69 degrees. He gave up a double in the third to Danny Espinosa, who took third base when Hairston flied out to center. But Espinosa was thrown out at home by shortstop Jimmy Rollins while trying to score on a chopper by Zimmermann.	Rookie Wilson Ramos singled in the fifth and then was caught stealing. Ramos later drew Lee's lone walk in the eighth. The only other Nationals player to reach base was pinch-hitter Jesus Flores, who singled leading off the ninth for his first hit in the majors since May 9, 2009.	Otherwise, Lee looked like the lefty Philadelphia figured it was getting when signing him to a $120 million, five-year contract this offseason.	In one stretch he struck out five in a row. In the seventh, Lee fanned the side -- the 2-3-4 hitters: Rick Ankiel, Jayson Werth, Adam LaRoche -- and got each one swinging at a 76 mph change. Here's the thing, though: Each final strike wound up in Ruiz's catching mitt in a completely different spot.	Fittingly, perhaps, Lee finished the game by getting Werth -- the costly free agent the Phillies let leave for Washington -- to ground out.	Halladay took a shutout into the ninth Wednesday before giving up a couple runs. Lee was even better. They're the Phillies' first starters to go the distance since Paul Byrd and Curt Schilling on May 11-12, 1999, against the St. Louis Cardinals.	"Nowadays, that's kind of rare," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said, understated as could be. "You don't see that too many times nowadays, so we're very happy with our pitching."	As well they should be.	Game notes	 Philadelphia first baseman Ryan Howard played a day after getting hit by a pitch on the right wrist. He went 0-for-4. ... The Nationals made two errors for the second game in a row. ... Eight of Lee's 11 career double-digit strikeout games have come since the start of last season.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.	Jhoulys Chacín has agreed to a guaranteed $1.25 million, one-year contract with the Rockies.	The Milwaukee Brewers acquired infielder Mike Brosseau from the Tampa Bay Rays for minor league pitcher Evan Reifert on Saturday in a trade between division winners.

PITTSBURGH --  Randy Wolf was the lone Milwaukee Brewers starting pitcher without a win and the only one with at least two starts and no scoreless outings.	He joined the rest of his staffmates with a gem on Thursday night.	Wolf struck out 10 and allowed only three hits in 6 2/3 innings, leading the Brewers to a 4-1 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates.	"You feel like you want to contribute and help this team, and it feels good finally to be able to do that," Wolf said.	"I think we'ved changed the mentality here about our idea of pitching and our pride about what we do on the mound," he said.	Brewers starters have gone 6-1 with a 1.84 ERA over the past nine games.	Wolf (1-2) allowed two singles, a double and two walks and didn't allow a Pittsburgh runner to advance past second base. Milwaukee narrowly missed out on its second consecutive shutout and majors-best fourth in 12 games this season when Pittsburgh scored on a John Axford wild pitch in the ninth.	"[Wolf] kept them off balance real good," catcher Jonathan Lucroy said. "He mixed it up and sped 'em up, slowed 'em down and put 'em away when he had to."	Kameron Loe followed with 1 2/3 hitless innings, but Andrew McCutchen scored Pittsburgh's first run in 23 innings when he came home on the wild pitch after drawing a walk.	Milwaukee has won its past seven April games at PNC Park by a combined score of 65-6, the past four by a combined score of 38-1.	In April games vs. the Pirates since 2005 overall, Milwaukee has won 19 of 21.	The Brewers have won four straight and seven of eight after starting 0-4.	"I feel a lot of positive energy in this clubhouse," Lucroy said. "I feel good when I come in here. And I feel like that no one even remembers that start."	The Pirates managed four hits to fall to 1-5 on their opening homestand.	For the fifth time in six home games this season, Pittsburgh was behind before it even came to bat.	Prince Fielder entered the game 3-for-42 lifetime against Pirates starter Paul Maholm (0-2) but lined a single with two on and none out that drove in Rickie Weeks in the first. That was Fielder's NL-leading 15th RBI -- all coming within his current seven-game hitting streak. Two batters later, a Yuniesky Betancourt sacrifice fly scored Ryan Braun to make it 2-0.	"Everyone knows that Maholm gives me trouble, so to be able to get that hit and get that run was really, really key," Fielder said.	"Especially with Randy. He was locked in," he said.	Those two early runs proved too much of a deficit for the punchless Pirates to overcome -- even with a revamped lineup Thursday. Pittsburgh came in with no runs and only four hits (all singles) in the previous 14 innings.	The streak of extra-base hits would last until the sixth, when Neil Walker's fly deep to left bounced out of Ryan Braun's glove and was ruled a double.	Pirates manager Clint Hurdle sat struggling third baseman Pedro Alvarez (.200, no home runs) in favor or Steve Pearce. He moved cleanup hitter Lyle Overbay (.238, one homer) down in the order and inserted platoon right fielder Matt Diaz into the No. 4 spot. Pittsburgh starting catcher Chris Snyder also made his season debut after being activated from the disabled list.	The result of the lineup shuffle was more of the same for an offense that ranks last in the NL in runs and entered the game 13th in batting average.	"We were not able to create the big inning, let alone chip away," Hurdle said.	"We've just got to find a way to push through it, play through it, hit through it," he said,	Wolf entered 8-3 lifetime against the Pirates, but in his most recent appearance against them he allowed career highs in runs (12) and hits (13) in 5 2/3 innings last July 21.	The outing marked the 14th time he had 10 or more strikeouts in a game.	After allowing four of the first five batters he faced to reach, Maholm retired 20 of his final 23. He was charged with two runs on four hits and three walks with six strikeouts in seven innings.	"I would much rather have come out and put up a zero in the first and let our guys relax and not put us behind," Maholm said. "But you go out there and you try to make sure your team stays in the game. As soon as they got two, I just kind of said, 'That's it.' You've got to get seven innings and keep them there and give the guys a chance."	The Brewers added two in the ninth off Joel Hanrahan.	Game notes	 Visiting teams have 12 first-inning runs in six games at PNC Park this season. ... Milwaukee is 48-17 vs. Pittsburgh since 2007. ...

ATLANTA --  Brian Sanches earned the decision, but Florida manager Edwin Rodriguez said his entire bullpen deserved the credit.	Five Florida relievers combined for four scoreless innings, John Buck drove in the go-ahead run with a seventh-inning single and the Marlins held off the Atlanta Braves 6-5 on Thursday night.	The relievers shut down the Braves after Florida starter Ricky Nolasco gave up five runs in five innings.	"The bullpen kept doing what they've been doing," Rodriguez said. "Outstanding. It seems like everybody is feeling comfortable with their role."	Buck was 0 for 9 in the series before driving in Gaby Sanchez from second base with the single off Eric O'Flaherty (0-1) to break a 5-5 tie.	Buck said he hit a fastball after O'Flaherty threw two changeups.	"I was struggling a little bit," Buck said. "Sometimes a hit like that helps."	The Marlins have won two of three in both Houston and Atlanta for a successful start to their nine-game road trip, which shifts to Philadelphia on Friday.	"I think anytime you beat a ballclub like the Braves, it should give you confidence," Buck said.	Sanchez had two hits, including his first homer. Logan Morrison had a two-run double and Hanley Ramirez was on base five times with three hits, including a run-scoring single, and two walks.	Brian McCann hit a three-run home run and Dan Uggla also homered for Atlanta.	Sanches (2-0) pitched a scoreless sixth inning to earn the win and Leo Nunez pitched the ninth for his fourth save. Randy Choate, Mike Dunn and Clay Hensley also pitched for the Marlins.	"That's what it's going to take, a full group effort, up and down the lineup," Buck said.	Chris Coghlan had two hits to go 7 for 12 in the series and continue his success against the Braves. Coghlan has hits in 20 straight games against Atlanta, including 10 straight at Turner Field.	Coghlan also delivered the key defensive play of the game with a diving catch in center of pinch-hitter Brooks Conrad's bases-loaded line drive off Sanches to end the sixth.	"It was kind of like Coghlan came out of nowhere," Sanches said. "I thought that was in the gap for sure. A great catch."	The Marlins scored three in the first on a run-scoring double by Mike Stanton and Morrison's two-run double. Ramirez drove in Buck, who walked, with a single in the second, and Sanchez hit his first homer in the third.	Each starting pitcher struggled. Nolasco lasted five innings, giving up five runs on six hits, including two homers, and a walk.	Nolasco managed to last five innings after throwing 33 pitches in the first while giving up four runs.	"Ricky showed a lot of heart," Buck said. "Ricky didn't have his plus stuff. He stepped up and somehow got us into the fifth. He could have easily cashed it in."	Braves rookie Brandon Beachy gave up five runs on seven hits and four walks in 5 1/3 innings for Atlanta.	Martin Prado, Nate McLouth and Chipper Jones reached on singles, with Jones driving in Prado. McCann followed with his three-run homer to right.	After his long first inning, Nolasco regrouped quickly by throwing only seven pitches in the second and six while retiring the Braves in order in the third. Nolasco gave up the homer to Uggla in the fourth as the Braves pulled even at 5-5.	Game notes	Greg Dobbs struck out in each of his three at-bats against Beachy. Dobbs has six strikeouts in six career at-bats against the right-hander, including three with the Phillies in 2010. ... Nolasco did not walk a batter in his first two starts. He issued his first walk of the season, to Jason Heyward, in the fourth. ... Peter Moylan struck out Stanton to end the sixth with the bases loaded. ... Ramirez lifted his batting average from .194 to .256.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

HOUSTON --  Bud Norris had some hiccups in the six scoreless innings he pitched in Houston's three-hitter Thursday night.	During those struggles the 26-year-old pitcher thought about recent advice he's received from veteran Houston ace Brett Myers.	"Giving up a [hit] is not the end of the world, but making sure that you can get out of that jam and leave that guy on base is the biggest part of it," Norris said of the one-pitch-at-a-time philosophy Myers preaches to him.	Norris and the Houston bullpen combined on a three-hitter, Michael Bourn singled home the only run and the Astros beat the San Diego Padres 1-0.	Norris (1-1) gave up two hits and struck out seven in six innings. His sacrifice bunt in the bottom of the sixth set up Bourn's RBI hit off Dustin Moseley (0-3).	"The focus was big," Houston manager Brad Mills said of his starter's outing. "Even though he threw a lot of pitches he didn't let that affect him. He knew that he had to come back and make some pitches and he did."	Relievers Fernando Abad, Mark Melancon and Brandon Lyon combined to close out the win. Lyon pitched a perfect ninth for his second save.	Moseley allowed seven hits in 6 2/3 innings and once again was the victim of the Padres' poor run support. San Diego's three shutouts this season have all come in his starts. The last starter to get shut out in three consecutive starts to begin a season was Detroit's Kenny Rogers in 2008, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.	"It's frustrating, but you go out there and do your job, and you leave the rest up to the team, and hopefully guys pull through," Moseley said. "Through the first three it hasn't happened, but it's a long year. I mean, these guys can start scoring 10 a game for me."	Padres manager Bud Black isn't worried about Moseley getting too discouraged by the lack of run support.	"Dustin's been around long enough to know that his job is to get outs, and over the long haul the wins will come," Black said.	The game was scoreless when Humberto Quintero hit a leadoff single in the sixth. Norris bunted and Bourn singled, but Moseley was able to limit the damage by getting Carlos Lee on a grounder with two on.	The Padres had several chances to score and stranded seven runners.	Eric Patterson reached on catcher's interference against Quintero in the eighth and stole second. With runners at the corners, Orlando Hudson hit a grounder and Patterson was thrown out at the plate.	Matt Downs and Quintero hit consecutive singles with two outs in the seventh and Moseley left after walking Melancon. It was an embarrassing first major league plate appearance for Melancon -- he thought he'd struck out and began to walk away, only to quickly realize a pitch had been ball three, rather than strike three.	Cory Luebke took Bourn to a full count before striking him out to end that inning.	"It was a close pitch and I just assumed the umpire was going to ring me up because I'm a pitcher and had never had an at-bat before," Melancon said.	Melancon said it took some time to get himself together to pitch the eighth inning after his first at-bat.	"It was actually really difficult," he said. "I threw eight warmup pitches and every one of my warmup pitches I had no idea where the ball was going ... when the guy got back in the box I was ready to go and calmed down from the [at-bat] and being on base which was like being on Mars for me."	Mills didn't hesitate to leave Melancon in to hit because he's been his most consistent reliever this season and he needed him for the eighth inning. Melancon has pitched 7 2/3 scoreless innings in eight appearances this season.	"He's thrown the ball well and he's the guy we wanted out there in that situation," Mills said. "It was nice to see him go back out there and get through it. There were some ugly things there that put him in a situation, but at the same time he did a good job of working through them."	Abad replaced Norris to start the seventh inning but he was relieved by Melancon after giving up a single to Cameron Maybin with one out. Jason Bartlett grounded into a double play to keep the Padres scoreless entering the eighth inning.	Norris gave up a pair of singles with one out in the first inning before striking out Ryan Ludwick and Nick Hundley to escape the jam. He didn't allow another baserunner until consecutive walks with two out in the third inning but he retired Ludwick for the third out.	He retired nine of the last 10 batters he faced before being replaced by Abad.	Game notes	 Houston reliever Wilton Lopez was experiencing elbow soreness and was expected to be examined by a doctor soon. ... Astros SS Clint Barmes, on the disabled list with a broken left hand, is scheduled to have X-rays on Monday to determine how his hand is healing.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Knowing a heavy rainstorm was bearing down on Kansas City, Ned Yost made a few adjustments, such as employing late-game strategy in the third inning.	The Royals manager had Chris Getz lay down a sacrifice, something he almost never does so early, and two batters later Alex Gordon lashed a two-run double down the right-field line. Wilson Betemit also drove in two runs and Bruce Chen did the rest, pitching eight strong innings to help the Royals post a 5-1 rain-shortened victory over the Seattle Mariners on Thursday night.	"We played the third inning like it was the seventh inning," Yost said. "The key to that inning was Alex Gordon's two-run double. That was a great at-bat by Alex. It got us on the board knowing that rain was coming somewhere in the night. We had reports it was going to start at 8, at 8:15 and 8:30, a pretty good downpour. So we tried to get on the board early in case it came in the first four or five innings."	The game was called after a delay of 47 minutes in the bottom of the eighth.	"We all knew the weather was coming," Gordon said. "You never know after five innings. You want to get that lead early. We in the dugout all knew that, and once we got ahead, we just cruised and let Chen do his thing."	Chen (2-0) allowed six hits and walked one in his fourth career complete game and second in his last four starts dating to his final game last year. He improved to 4-0 against the Mariners and has won his last six decisions overall to even his career record at 50-50.	The left-hander had tossed 13 consecutive scoreless innings before Adam Kennedy's sacrifice fly drove in an unearned run in the eighth.	Gordon's double was off Doug Fister (0-3), and he scored on Billy Butler's single for a 3-0 lead. Betemit homered in the fourth and had a sacrifice fly in the sixth in front of a crowd of 8,811 -- lower than Kansas City's smallest attendance at any game in 2010.	"They said it was going to [rain] about 8 to 8:30 and it did," Seattle manager Eric Wedge said. "We were still able to get deep in the ballgame. We had our opportunities, We just couldn't take advantage of them."	In Fister's three starts this season covering 18 2/3 innings, the Mariners have scored two runs. They have four or fewer runs in 10 of their last 11 games.	"If you throw 100 pitches, there's always going to be three or four that can cause turmoil in a game," Fister said. "They capitalized on some of my mistakes. I left a couple of balls too much over the plate that were high."	Fister yielded eight hits in seven innings, finishing with five strikeouts and a walk.	Seattle's Ichiro Suzuki singled in the third and fifth, going 2-for-4 to match George Brett's Kauffman Stadium record of nine consecutive multihit games. He's hit safely in 15 straight games in Kauffman.	Alcides Escobar and Melky Cabrera singled ahead of Gordon's double in the third. Cabrera had two hits and has at least one hit in eight of the last nine games.	Betemit connected with one out in the fourth, driving a 1-1 pitch over the wall in left for his first homer. His fly ball to left in the sixth scored Kila Ka'aihue, who reached on a one-out single and went to third on Jeff Francoeur's base hit.	Chone Figgins doubled in the eighth and went to third when Milton Bradley reached on first baseman Ka'aihue's error. Kennedy then hit a fly ball to center for Seattle's only run.	"Chen did a good job," Wedge said. "He moved the ball around. He was running it in on some of the right-handers and dropping his breaking stuff in to the lefties. He pitched a good ballgame."	Game notes	 Mariners center fielder Franklin Gutierrez will begin a rehab assignment on Friday at Class A High Desert. He's been out since March 30 with a stomach ailment. ... Cabrera made a terrific catch in center field on Justin Smoak's deep fly ball. ... Brett had nine straight multihit games in Kauffman Stadium from May 1-28, 1979, when it was still called Royals Stadium.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  Phil Coke spent one offseason working as a chimney sweep in the town of Sonora, nestled in the foothills of Northern California.	Now Coke is mopping up hitters exactly as the Detroit Tigers envisioned he would when they reserved a spot for the left-hander in their starting rotation.	Coke and two relievers combined on a three-hitter, Ryan Raburn hit a two-out RBI double in the seventh inning to break a scoreless tie and the Tigers held on for a 3-0 win over the Oakland Athletics on Thursday night.	"He was impressive," Detroit manager Jim Leyland said. "His mindset was to be a starter and he's getting into a groove. His demeanor was real good and he seemed much more calm. I think being more regimented helped him."	Primarily a reliever throughout his career, Coke made his first start in the majors late in the 2010 season and was impressive enough to earn a spot in the Tigers' rotation this year. Because of the schedule, Coke opened the year in Detroit's bullpen when Leyland worked with a four-man rotation, but he's been solid ever since.	Coke (1-2) allowed only one Oakland runner past first base and retired 16 of the final 18 batters he faced. Joaquin Benoit pitched the eighth and Jose Valverde worked the ninth for his third save in as many chances.	"It's remembering how to do it," Coke said. "I was staying focused on what my job is, getting out there and getting it done. I wasn't thinking about anything except to see the glove and hit it."	Coke grew up in Sonora, a tiny town some 2 1/2 hours east of Oakland. Several friends and family were in attendance Thursday, including his former boss from when Coke was a chimney sweep.	They saw Coke earn his first win since July 26, 2009.	It was a welcome performance for the Tigers, who were stymied by Oakland starter Gio Gonzalez for six innings before scoring three times against the A's bullpen.	"Early on we were going pitch for pitch," Coke said. "That's cool. 'You and me, let's go nine.'"	Ramon Santiago had two hits and drove in a run on a sacrifice fly in the eighth for Detroit. Leyland now needs one win to become the 19th manager in major league history to reach 1,500 for his career.	The Tigers had four hits, matching their season low, but held on behind Coke's second straight solid start after he opened the year in the bullpen. Coke pitched seven shutout innings and struck out two for his first victory of the season.	Conor Jackson singled twice for the A's, who were shut out for the first time this year.	"You could tell we were a little beat up today, a little tired," Gonzalez said. "When I was in the sixth inning, my arm was dropping a little bit. Detroit's a good lineup and it shows."	The Tigers, who won their previous two games on walk-off hits, couldn't get anything going against Gonzalez but broke through after he departed.	Santiago greeted reliever Tyson Ross (1-1) with a sharp single to center and was sacrificed to second. After Casper Wells flew out to right, Raburn doubled hard off the wall in right-center. Santiago, who also singled in the fifth, scored easily.	That was all Coke (1-2) and Detroit's bullpen needed to slow down the surging A's.	Gonzalez gave up just two hits and extended his scoreless streak to 17 consecutive innings, but struggled with his control most of the game and matched his career high with six walks. Gonzalez also threw two wild pitches.	A 15-game winner for Oakland in 2010, Gonzalez still lowered his ERA to a stellar 0.47 before giving way to Ross in the seventh.	After giving up Raburn's RBI double in the seventh, Ross walked the first two batters in the eighth. Jeremy Blevins replaced Ross and promptly walked Brandon Inge to load the bases, then fell behind 3-0 to Santiago.	Two pitches later, Santiago hit a sacrifice fly to left to score Jhonny Peralta. Oakland left fielder Josh Willingham threw to third base but no one was covering and the ball skipped into the A's dugout. Brennan Boesch, who was at second, was awarded two bases and scored to make it 3-0.	Overall, A's pitchers combined to issue a season-high 11 walks.	Game notes	 The A's got good news on two of their key relievers. Closer Andrew Bailey (forearm strain) threw a 25-pitch bullpen session without a setback while RHP Michael Wuertz (hamstring) felt fine after pitching a simulated inning. Both pitchers are on the disabled list but there is no word on when either might return. ... Detroit recalled RHP Al Alburquerque from Toledo (IL), filling the roster spot vacated when RHP Robbie Weinhardt was optioned to the Mud Hens following Wednesday's win against Texas. ... Tigers RHP Ryan Perry, out since April 5 due to an infected eye, will begin a rehab assignment with Toledo on Friday. .. Detroit will play seven more games in Oakland this season, its most since 1969. ... Oakland 2B Mark Ellis was awarded a triple for a ball he hit against Minnesota on April that was originally ruled an error. .. The A's are 1-4 in series-opening games this season.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

LOS ANGELES --  The runs just keep on coming for St. Louis.	Powered by Albert Pujols and Matt Holliday, the Cardinals' offense feasted on the Los Angeles Dodgers' pitching in a 9-5 victory on Thursday night.	St. Louis won for the fourth time in five games, and is averaging more than nine runs in that stretch.	"We made some good contact and got some timely hits," manager Tony La Russa said. "We're just having good at-bats. Once you have a little success, you get more confidence."	Pujols homered for the second time this season and Holliday drove in three runs and scored twice to continue his dominance against the Dodgers. He's batting .345 in 92 career games against them, while his 70 runs in 84 games against the Dodgers since 2005 leads the major leagues.	"We've swung the bats really well the last four, five games," Holliday said. "My timing was off in Arizona, but I felt better tonight."	The Dodgers' second homestand of the season opened with a heavy security presence inside and outside the stadium, the result of a San Francisco Giants fan being severely beaten on opening day last month.	"If it makes it safer for fans, why not?" Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said before the game.	No one has been arrested despite the offer of more than $150,000 in reward money.	Hall of Fame broadcasters Vin Scully and Jaime Jarrin appeared on the stadium's video board with English and Spanish messages before the game urging fans to have a good time but respect those around them.	Los Angeles police didn't immediately have a tally but reported a few citations issued before the game. Inside the stadium, the announced crowd of 34,288 was low-key and many fans streamed out after the seventh-inning stretch with the Dodgers trailing by six runs. Owner Frank McCourt's box was deserted by the eighth.	Jaime Garcia (2-0) allowed three runs -- two earned -- and five hits in five innings, struck out two and walked two. The left-hander had allowed only one run in his two previous starts.	"I didn't have my best stuff, but I was battling and tried to stay in as long as I could and give my team a chance to win," he said. "My best two innings were my last two, I was settling in. Maybe I wasn't able to lock it in mentally."	Hiroki Kuroda (2-1) gave up a career-high-tying 10 hits and six runs -- five earned -- in five innings, struck out three and walked none in the Dodgers' third straight loss. His three wild pitches were a career high.	"They obviously have a great lineup with great hitters, but you still have to pitch aggressively to them," he said through a translator. "So it was a real learning experience, and hopefully I'll get them next time."	Pujols sent a 3-2 pitch from Kuroda into the lower left-field seats with one out in the fifth, extending the Cardinals' lead to 5-3. The slugger has gotten off to a slow start this season and was 7-for-28 on the road trip before homering.	Holliday hit a two-run double in the seventh and had an RBI single in the third a night after going hitless for the first time this season. Every position player in the Cardinals' lineup had at least one hit as they won their second in a row.	"With a club like that, you know they're going to score, so it was just a matter of time for them," Mattingly said. "You don't want to catch them at that time, but if we do, we've got to find a way to shut them down and keep them down and put some runs up ourselves."	Matt Kemp had two RBIs and three hits, including a homer in the ninth, and Jamey Carroll had three hits for the Dodgers, who also scored on a passed ball by Yadier Molina in the fourth.	Game notes	 Dodgers RF Andre Ethier singled in the first, extending his hitting streak to 11 games, tied for longest in the majors this season with Jose Reyes of the Mets. ... The Cardinals won at Dodger Stadium after going winless three times here last season. ... NBA Hall of Famers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Sharman, who played in the minors with the Dodgers in the 1950s, tossed out first pitches. ... Former Dodgers manager Tom Lasorda and his wife, Jo, celebrated their 61st wedding anniversary at the game.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CLEVELAND --  Justin Masterson has simply been doing what he's been told.	So far, the results have made him unbeatable.	"I told him, 'Throw that little white thing over that larger white thing as much as you can,'" Cleveland Indians pitching coach Tim Belcher said. "If he does that, his stuff is so sick. If he throws strikes over the plate, he's going to give us a chance to win."	Masterson pitched seven strong innings for his third straight win, Asdrubal Cabrera had four RBIs and the surprising Indians kept the AL Central standings flipped upside down with an 8-2 win over the Baltimore Orioles on Friday night.	Masterson (3-0), who allowed just one run and four singles, went 6-13 last season. He didn't get his third win until July 1 -- in his 16th start.	"I saw that on the bottom of the TV," Masterson said, glancing at nearby screen. "I was like, 'Wow, that's a long time.'"	Travis Hafner homered for Cleveland, which entered the series tied for first with the Kansas City Royals. Last season, the Indians finished fourth in the division, two games ahead of the last-place Royals.	Cabrera's two-run single highlighted Cleveland's four-run third inning off rookie Zach Britton (2-1), who gave up five runs and eight hits in six innings. Six of those hits came in a row during the third when the Indians got a triple and five consecutive singles.	"One inning was the difference," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said, "but I was proud of the way he responded. He came back, battled, pitched well."	The Orioles have lost five straight since a stunning 6-1 start.	At 9-4, Cleveland is off to its best start since 2002.	"This is fun," Masterson said.	After struggling for most of 2010, Masterson began to show signs of becoming a dependable starter in the final two months. The 6-foot-6 right-hander has carried that over into this season with three solid starts and wins over the Chicago White Sox, Seattle Mariners and now Orioles.	Masterson, who got 12 of his 21 outs on grounders, credits slight changes with his mechanics too making him a different pitcher this season. Also an emphasis on throwing his first pitch over the plate. He threw first-pitch strikes to 20 of 26 hitters.	"Throwing that first pitch in there allows you to expand the zone a little, which is great with the stuff that I have," he said. "It's been very simple, subtle stuff but I've done it enough to just go out and pitch and gain confidence with what I have."	The Indians were hoping to build on a 4-2 trip to Seattle and Los Angeles, and they're off to a good start by winning their fifth straight at home.	Cabrera added another two-run single in the seventh, when Cleveland blew it open against Baltimore's bullpen.	Britton won his first two starts, allowing just one run in his first 13 2/3 innings to beat the Tampa Bay Rays and Texas Rangers. Showalter said the 23-year-old displayed something special in spring training before even throwing a pitch.	"You could see it in his eyes," Showalter said before the game. "He's not too cool for school, but his first thoughts are always 'What have I got to do to stay here?' He's grounded and puts the team first."	Britton's sinker ran away from Cleveland's hitters in the first two innings, but the bottom of the order figured out how to hit him in the third, when the Indians opened a 4-0 lead with six consecutive hits and a sacrifice fly.	"It was a little disappointing there," Britton said. "The pitches were down but getting too much of the plate. We're going through a tough stretch and I wanted to give us a good outing. I had a good opportunity to get us back on track, so that makes this more disappointing."	Matt LaPorta, not exactly known for his speed on the basepaths, stretched what looked like a double off the left-field wall into a leadoff triple. Lou Marson, starting in place of slumping catcher Carlos Santana, followed with an RBI single and two more singles loaded the bases before Cabrera grounded a two-run single to center.	Hafner's sacrifice fly made it 4-0, and Britton only avoided more damage when the Orioles successfully appealed that Cabrera left second too early.	Masterson roared through Baltimore's lineup the first time. He retired nine in a row before Brian Roberts singled to open the fourth, when the Orioles got a two-out RBI single from Luke Scott.	Game notes	 Indians outfielder Grady Sizemore worked out with the club Friday and is expected to remain in Cleveland for at least one more day as he gets closer to rejoining the club after missing most of last season following knee surgery. ... Indians right-hander Joe Smith (abdominal strain) was activated before the game and made his season debut in the ninth, giving up one run. ... According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Britton is first Orioles pitcher to allow just one earned run in his first two starts since Tom Phoebus, who did it in 1954 when the franchise was still in St. Louis. ... Showalter said left-hander Brian Matusz is "progressing, but not ready to throw off the mound yet." Matusz opened the season on the disabled list with a strained left intercostal muscle.

NEW YORK --  Matt Harrison and the Texas Rangers caused more trouble for the New York Yankees.	Double trouble, in fact.	Texas tied an AL record by turning six double plays and the Rangers picked up where they left off last October, beating the Yankees 5-3 Friday night.	The first six hitters in the New York lineup bounced into DPs -- Alex Rodriguez, Mark Teixeira, Robinson Cano, Derek Jeter, Andruw Jones and Nick Swisher.	"We needed some good things to happen," Texas manager Ron Washington said, "and those double plays were good."	The teams played for the first time since Texas battered the Yankees to win last year's AL Championship Series in six games. The Rangers won this time with pitching, thanks to Harrison (3-0) and his sure-handed fielders on a chilly, windy evening.	Harrison twice grabbed grounders and started DPs. Shortstop Elvis Andrus saved him once, jumping high to catch Harrison's throw before making the relay. Second baseman Ian Kinsler started a trio of DPs and third baseman Adrian Beltre began the other one.	"Can't say enough about the defense," Harrison said. "It's huge."	Told that Texas tied a record, Andrus smiled. "Really?" he said.	Andrus took part in five of them. That's the way he likes things -- strikeouts and fly balls, he said, can be boring.	"You want some ground balls," Andrus said. "You want some action."	This was the 15th time an AL team made six DPs in a game. The major league mark for double plays in a game is seven by San Francisco in 1969.	"It's not enjoyable to watch double plays," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.	Girardi actually thought the Rangers made even more. When someone mentioned to him that Texas had six, he corrected the questioner.	"Seven, right?" he said.	Either way, Harrison induced a lot of them.	"If you have that many, he's doing something right. You're making good pitches when you have to," Girardi said.	Harrison pitched in short sleeves despite the cold and gave up two runs and seven hits in eight innings. The 25-year-old lefty has pitched at least seven innings in every start this season, having previously beaten Boston and Baltimore.	Harrison stayed in control after moving up a day in the Rangers rotation. Colby Lewis' spot was skipped after the birth of his daughter this week, and he became the first player to go on Major League Baseball's new paternity leave list.	Even when the Yankees threatened in the eighth, with Curtis Granderson homering and Jeter following with a single, Washington stuck with Harrison. Swisher promptly bounced into the final DP.	Neftali Feliz pitched the ninth for his fifth save. Pinch hitter Eric Chavez had an RBI single with two outs and Jorge Posada followed with a walk, but Russell Martin hit a routine fly ball to end it.	Harrison has the best run support of any pitcher with at least 30 starts since the beginning of the 2008 season -- more than seven runs per game -- and Texas again backed him despite getting outhit 9-4 by the Yankees.	Michael Young doubled, singled and drove in two runs. The double was his 353rd, breaking the team record set by Ivan Rodriguez.	Ivan Nova (1-1) pitched like the 24-year-old rookie he is. Whether it was the Texas lineup or the weather, he was all over the place. Nova gave up five runs on four hits and five walks in 4 1/3 innings.	The game-time temperature was 47 degrees, but the winds made it feel much worse. That may've contributed to a most messy inning in the Texas fifth. The Rangers took advantage of three walks, three wild pitches and a hit batter to score three times off Nova and reliever David Robertson for a 5-1 lead.	Game notes	 Yankees reliever Lance Pendleton, promoted from Triple-A earlier in the day, made his major league debut and pitched three perfect innings. ... Texas tied a team record for DPs. The Yankees set a club mark for hitting into the most. ... Rangers 1B Mitch Moreland matched the AL record by taking part in all six double plays. ... Cleveland was the last AL team to have six DPs, in 2009. Of the 15 times an AL team has turned six DPs, three have come in extra innings. ... The Yankees made one DP. The major league record for combined double plays in a game is nine.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

WASHINGTON --  When Jayson Werth signed a huge contract with the Washington Nationals last winter, the team surely expected lots of big hits and solid play in the outfield.	No one could have anticipated him to score the winning run the way he did Friday night.	Werth, who reached on a throwing error by Milwaukee Brewers' shortstop Yuniesky Betancourt in the 10th inning, kept on running to second after the ball eluded first baseman Prince Fielder, stole third without a throw and scored on an infield bouncer by Adam LaRoche.	The 4-3 Nationals' win was an unusual one. None of the four runs was driven home on a base hit and they won despite getting just five hits.	Their win came after Roy Halladay and Cliff Lee held them to nine hits in two complete-game losses to Philadelphia.	"You've got to scratch out some wins when you're not hitting on all cylinders," Washington manager Jim Riggleman said.	Werth shocked everyone by dashing to third without catcher Jonathan Lucroy throwing.	"I just had something there," Werth said. "We're having a hard time getting the bats going. When that's the case, you have to do something extra a little bit."	Milwaukee reliever Zach Braddock (0-1), might not have thought Werth was going, but manager Ron Roenicke did.	"I could tell what Werth was doing. I could tell he was trying to time him, and he had him timed well," Roenicke said.	After the stolen base, the Brewers played a five-man infielder with left fielder Ryan Braun playing between first and second. LaRoche bounced to first and Fielder's throw home pulled Lucroy off the plate, and Werth scored the winning run.	"He's just fast. He's just faster than me. He was safe," Fielder said.	Third baseman Casey McGehee wasn't holding Werth on.	"We were going on contact the whole time," Werth said. "With him off the bag, I was able to get a bigger lead. The last thing you want to do is get picked off."	Chad Gaudin (1-1), the Nationals' fifth pitcher, worked a scoreless 10th.	Tom Gorzelanny allowed two runs and five hits, struck out four and walked two in his second start for Washington. In his previous appearance, he gave up five earned runs in 5 1/3 innings. Gorzelanny was the beneficiary when Milwaukee's Chris Narveson allowed three walks in a three-run second inning.	Rickie Weeks had three hits -- including a two-run homer for the Brewers, who had won their previous four games.	The Nationals scored three runs against Narveson in the second. LaRoche led off with a walk. Singles to Wilson Ramos and Michael Morse loaded the bases, and with one out, Narveson walked Jerry Hairston and Gorzelanny to score LaRoche and Ramos. Morse scored on Danny Espinosa's sacrifice fly.	Espinosa was elevated to the leadoff spot and Ian Desmond took his place in the seventh spot in an effort to generate more offense. Riggleman said he hoped that Desmond, who is hitless in his last 14 at-bats, would feel less pressure batting seventh.	Weeks hit a long two-run home run to the back of the left field bullpen off Gorzelanny with two outs in the fifth. It was his fourth homer of the season and made it 3-2.	Weeks doubled with two outs in the ninth inning off Sean Burnett, who blew his first save after converting his first three. He scored on Carlos Gomez's single to tie the score at 3.	Narveson, who hadn't allowed a run in his first 14 innings -- the longest to begin a season by a Milwaukee left-handed starter -- gave up four walks in his first two starts. He allowed four in 5 2/3 innings. Narveson gave up three runs and five hits and struck out five.	Game notes	 Brewers RHP Zack Greinke threw 30 pitches in a simulated game. If he feels fine on Saturday, Milwaukee will send him on a rehab assignment. "It was pretty good all around," Greinke said. "It might not be the sharpest or the best, but I'll be ready. I feel like I can execute some stuff, just get the endurance and hopefully get ready." ... Greinke thinks he'll start at Class A Brevard County. ... Roenicke said that OF Corey Hart, who's on the 15-day disabled list with an oblique strain, needs three or four more batting practices before he can be sent on a rehab assignment. ... Brewers OF Nyjer Morgan, who was traded from the Nationals last month, did not play. He's batting .476.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PHILADELPHIA --  There was no fist-pumping, jubilant high-fiving or any display of excitement. If Greg Dobbs felt any extra satisfaction for beating his former team, he kept it to himself.	Dobbs delivered a pinch-hit, go-ahead two-run single and the Florida Marlins rallied to beat the Philadelphia Phillies 4-3 on Friday night.	"It feels good regardless of who you're playing against," Dobbs said.	Dobbs spent the previous four seasons in Philadelphia. He batted .301 and was a key player off the bench for the World Series championship team in 2008.	But he got an earful of boos when he came to the plate from fans who mostly remember his .196 batting average last year.	"I heard a couple boos and a couple of cheers," Dobbs said. "I came in here to do my job and help the team."	It may have been a costly loss for the NL East-leading Phillies because Roy Oswalt left with a back strain. Oswalt pitched six impressive innings before getting hurt. He allowed two runs and four hits, striking out six. He didn't allow a hit until Logan Morrison led off the fifth with a home run into Philadelphia's bullpen.	The team initially said Oswalt strained his lower back. But Oswalt said the pain was in the middle. The three-time All-Star hopes to make his next scheduled start on Wednesday.	"It's not to the point where it's unbearable," Oswalt said. "It's a muscle spasm."	Five Marlins relievers combined for four scoreless innings after starter Javier Vazquez struggled through five. Edward Mujica (2-1) worked the sixth. Ryan Webb pitched a perfect seventh, Randy Choate snared a line drive against the only batter he faced and Clay Hensley got the two he faced out. Leo Nunez finished for his fifth save in as many tries.	Vazquez allowed three runs and five hits. He walked four and had to pitch out of the stretch most of the night with runners on base.	"Javier struggled with his location, but he battled and kept us in the game," Marlins manager Edwin Rodriguez said. "Then the bullpen finished it off."	Oswalt felt something in his back in the fifth. It tightened up even more when he ran to first after putting down a bunt in the bottom of the sixth. He stayed in and ran the bases but came out after trying his warm-up pitches.	A well-rested bullpen that hadn't been used the previous two games couldn't hold the lead.	J.C. Romero allowed an infield single to Morrison. Danys Baez (1-1) relieved and walked Gaby Sanchez. John Buck followed with a soft single to center to load the bases. After Donnie Murphy popped out to second, Dobbs lined a two-run single to left to put the Marlins ahead 4-3.	"I just keep the same routine," Dobbs said. "Just stay steady, not too high, not too low."	The Phillies' bullpen was fresh because Roy Halladay and Cliff Lee pitched consecutive complete games. Lee tossed a 12-strikeout, three-hit shutout against the Washington Nationals on Thursday. Halladay took a shutout into the ninth and went the distance in a 3-2 win a night earlier.	For a while, it seemed Oswalt would make it three in a row. Wearing short sleeves on a chilly night, Oswalt baffled hitters with a sharp fastball and deceptive offspeed pitches. He retired the first 11 batters before Hanley Ramirez walked in the fourth.	The Phillies jumped ahead with two runs in the first. Shane Victorino walked to start the inning and Jimmy Rollins lined a one-out double to right. Ryan Howard drove in the first run with a deep sacrifice fly. Raul Ibanez singled in Rollins to make it 2-0.	After Morrison's shot cut it to 2-1, the Phillies regained their two-run cushion in the bottom half. Victorino walked and Placido Polanco singled. After Rollins flied out and Howard lined out, Ibanez hit an RBI single for a 3-1 lead.	But the Marlins answered in the sixth. Chris Coghlan and Omar Infante hit consecutive one-out doubles to get Florida within 3-2. Oswalt then retired Ramirez on a grounder to second and got Mike Stanton to foul out to leave the tying on third.	Stanton, the promising sophomore cleanup hitter, was no match for the veteran right-hander. Oswalt got him to swing and miss at a nasty 72 mph curve. He then busted him inside with a 92 mph fastball that Stanton popped up to catcher Carlos Ruiz.	A crowd of 45,667 on Jackie Robinson Night was the second-largest in the regular season in the eight-year history of Citizens Bank Park. It was the 143rd consecutive sellout, including postseason.	Game notes	 The Phillies have won 15 of their last 16 series and six straight since last season. ... Vazquez is 12-8 against the Phillies. The 12 wins are his most against any team. ... All four of Morrison's homers this season have come against right-handers. ... Dobbs is 3-for-6 with four RBIs as a pinch hitter. ... Victorino made a diving catch to rob Sanchez of a hit leading off the ninth. ... Murphy left with a left knee contusion after fouling the ball off his leg in the ninth. Wes Helms finished the at-bat and struck out.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

BOSTON --  Another comeback win for the Toronto Blue Jays. Another loss for the Boston Red Sox.	Jose Bautista singled in the go-ahead run in a four-run seventh inning and the Blue Jays came from behind for the fifth time in seven wins this season, deepening the misery of the struggling Red Sox with a 7-6 victory on Friday night.	"They are all good wins," Blue Jays manager John Farrell said.	Good, bad or ugly, the Red Sox desperately need a win after dropping to 2-10, matching their poorest start in history and making the worst record in baseball even worse. They did hit two homers after managing just seven in their first 11 games, but finished with only five hits.	Brett Cecil (1-1) gave up those homers to Dustin Pedroia and Kevin Youkilis in the third when Boston went ahead 3-0. Toronto tied it on Corey Patterson's two-run double in the fifth and Travis Snider's RBI double in the sixth.	"This team is not going to quit and neither am I," Cecil said. "I feel great about tonight. Two bad pitches and that was it."	Bobby Jenks (0-1) started the seventh for Boston and allowed all four runs, making it 7-3.	The Red Sox scored three in the eighth on an RBI single by Jed Lowrie and a two-run double by Marco Scutaro.	"It's not going to mean anything tomorrow because we lost," Boston manager Terry Francona said, "but, always, we've got to give ourselves a chance. We're looking for positives."	Jon Rauch pitched the ninth for his third save, retiring Carl Crawford, Pedroia and Adrian Gonzalez.	"The guys battled all day and gave us a chance to win," Rauch said.	Crawford, who signed a seven-year, $142 million contract in the offseason, went 0-for-5 and is batting just .137 (7-for-51).	He appeared to beat out a ground ball leading off the first but was called out by first-base umpire Paul Nauert.	"You definitely try to keep the negative thoughts out of your head and try to stay positive because you know you have four more at-bats to go," Crawford said.	The game was the first between Francona and his former pitching coach, Farrell, who downplayed that matchup.	"I know they're out to beat us," he said, "and we're out to beat them."	The Blue Jays nearly took a 1-0 lead in the first when Adam Lind's drive down the right-field line was ruled a two-run homer by Nauert. Francona disputed the call. The umpires reviewed it and ruled the ball foul. Lind then grounded out. It was the ninth replay review ever at Fenway Park and sixth that was overturned.	"It looked like we caught a big break and we got the 3-0 lead," Francona said. "We didn't have a lot of hits but we had two big ones and then we let it get away."	The Red Sox went ahead against Cecil when Pedroia hit his second homer of the season, a solo shot. Gonzalez then walked and Youkilis followed with his first homer. David Ortiz then walked, but Cecil retired his remaining 11 batters before being replaced by Jason Frasor to start the seventh.	The Blue Jays began chipping away in the fifth when Clay Buchholz walked Juan Rivera and Jayson Nix and both scored on Patterson's double. In the sixth, they tied the score at 3 when Snider doubled home Lind, who had walked.	In the seventh, Jenks retired just one of the five batters he faced.	Nix led off with a walk and took third on a single by Yunel Escobar before Patterson struck out. Bautista then singled Nix home, putting Toronto on top 4-3, and Escobar took second. Lind singled in Escobar, and with Aaron Hill batting, Bautista and Lind pulled off a double steal. Then Bautista scored and Lind took third on a wild pitch.	Hill followed with an RBI single, chasing Jenks, and Felix Doubront ended the inning by retiring the next two batters.	Game notes	 The Red Sox also were 2-10 in 1925, 1927 and 1996. ... Before the game, Gonzalez signed a $154 million, seven-year contract running from 2012 to 2018. He already was signed for $6.3 million for this year. ... Escobar has reached base in all 10 games he's played. ... Patterson has six RBIs in four games since coming off the disabled list. ... Toronto placed IF Edwin Encarnacion on the bereavement list and recalled IF Mike McCoy and LHP Luis Perez from Triple-A Las Vegas. ... Lind's seventh-inning single snapped an 0-for-15 slump. ... Buchholz tied his career high with five walks.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

CINCINNATI --  Wind gusts howled through the upper decks and made it rain sideways at Great American Ball Park -- not the best kind of night to be standing on the mound.	"I saw a bunch of plastic bags fly by," Pirates starter Charlie Morton said. "I didn't know what was coming next."	What came next? A complete game.	Morton went the distance for the second time in his career, limiting the NL's most prolific lineup to five hits, and the Pirates ended their four-game losing streak by beating the Cincinnati Reds 6-1 in blustery conditions.	Sometimes, it was tough just to hold your ground.	"The only place I've been like that is in Candlestick Park," manager Clint Hurdle said. "With that much debris on the field, the wind, the rain -- the rain sideways. I mean, the rain's all over the place. You don't know where it's coming from. I think sometimes it was going back up. So it was challenging conditions to say the least.	"He stayed focus. It was Charlie's night. Our offense showed up, and it was Charlie's night."	The gusts sent food wrappers racing across the field and played havoc with flyballs -- one of Cincinnati's wind-blown flies landed for a hit. No problem for Morton (2-0), who kept his shutout until Jay Bruce homered with two outs in the ninth. His only other complete game was a shutout against the Cubs on Sept. 30, 2009.	Garrett Jones and Neil Walker homered off Bronson Arroyo (2-1), who gave up a season-high five runs in only four innings.	Hurdle rearranged his lineup for the second consecutive game, trying to get some runs out of the NL's lowest-scoring offense. This time, it worked. The six runs matched Pittsburgh's season high.	"At the end of the series at home, we were pressing," Walker said. "We were thinking we had to win. We relaxed a little bit today."	Five players batted in new positions in the lineup, with Andrew McCutchen batting leadoff for the first this season. McCutchen struck out four times. Everyone else did much better against Arroyo, who won his first two starts while still recovering from mononucleosis.	Jose Tabata had a career-high four hits. Garrett Jones, batting sixth for the first time this season, led off the second inning with a homer, snapping his 0-for-10 streak and getting the 14-hit Pirate night rolling.	Lyle Overbay, who loves hitting at Great American Ball Park, singled home a run in the fourth with two outs. Overbay is a .424 career hitter at the Reds' park, getting two more hits on Friday night.	Walker followed with a two-run homer on a two-strike pitch for a 5-0 lead -- two more runs than Arroyo had allowed in his first two starts combined. The right-hander has acknowledged he's still a little off after being diagnosed with mononucleosis during spring training.	"I felt stronger than I have all year," Arroyo said. "Those guys fought me hard tonight. You've got to [credit] Charlie. He threw a great game."	Cincinnati's offense bailed out Arroyo in the first two games, scoring a total of 18 runs. It couldn't do anything against Morton, who struck out three and got 15 outs on ground balls. The 27-year-old right-hander has given up only four earned runs in his three starts, winning back-to-back decisions for the first time in his career.	The Reds were missing second baseman Brandon Phillips, sidelined by a strained groin he suffered in the last game. Manager Dusty Baker said Phillips might miss one more game.	With time on his hands, Phillips sent out 36 tweets in two-hour span before the game. Phillips took up tweeting before the start of the season at the urging of Bengals receiver Chad Ochocinco.	Game notes	 RH Jeff Karstens will start for the Pirates on Sunday. ... McCutchen's four strikeouts were one shy of the club record. ... Pittsburgh called up LH reliever Joe Beimel before the game. ... Reds LH reliever Aroldis Chapman will get a couple days off to rest a tender pitching elbow.

After the game, the Reds announced that Mike Leake will start against the Pirates on Saturday in place of Edinson Volquez, who has a stiff neck and will be pushed back one day.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  The Tampa Bay Rays are gradually lifting themselves out of a season-opening hole.	Hit by hit. Win by win.	"We've got a long way to go," pitcher Wade Davis said Friday night after the defending AL East champions beat the Minnesota Twins 5-2 for their fourth straight victory. "But we're starting to jell a little bit and everybody's starting to play good baseball."	Davis pitched seven strong innings and Johnny Damon and Kelly Shoppach drove in two runs apiece, leading the Rays to their fifth victory in seven games following an 0-6 start in which they struggled to score runs.	Davis (1-2) limited the struggling Twins to three singles and Danny Valencia's fifth-inning RBI double before being replaced by Joel Peralta, the first of four relievers Rays manager Joe Maddon needed to get through the final two ininngs.	Minnesota, the defending AL Central champion, has dropped three in a row and five of its last six.	"Right now we're not getting it done. It's obvious," Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said. "We don't like to lose around here. We're not accustomed to it, and we're not going to get accustomed to it. We won't let that happen."	A night after beating the Twins with a 10th inning homer, the 37-year-old Damon delivered a two-run single off Nick Blackburn (1-2) to erase a 1-0 deficit in the sixth. Shoppach finished off the Minnesota starter with a two-run, seventh-inning homer for his first RBIs of the season.	Sam Fuld and Matt Joyce each had three hits for Tampa Bay, which has scored 37 runs in its five victories compared to 12 in its eight losses. Damon has hit safely in seven consecutive games after going 1-for-15 while the Rays were losing five straight home games to begin the season.	"Overall, another good team effort," Maddon said. "It's always spearheaded by good starting pitching and playing good defense. And we got the clutch hits when we needed them."	With one run in and a runner on first, Kyle Farnsworth came out of the bullpen to get the final out and earn his third save in as many opportunities for Tampa Bay. The run, charged to reliever Cesar Ramos, scored on shortstop Reid Brignac's throwing error.	Blackburn faded quickly after a promising first five innings for the Twins, playing their first game since three-time AL batting champion Joe Mauer was placed on the 15-day disabled list because of leg weakness. Gardenhire said earlier Friday that the catcher also has a viral infection, which the club believes has contributed to Mauer's body soreness.	For the second straight night, the Twins faltered after taking a lead. Carl Pavano worked eight scoreless innings in Thursday's series opener only to be denied the victory when closer Joe Nathan blew his first save in four opportunities this season by giving up a two-run double to Joyce in the ninth.	The Rays then won it in the 10th, overcoming a 3-2 deficit on Damon's two-run homer off Matt Capps.	The defending AL East champions didn't need to rally late this time.	Damon's two-run single put the Rays ahead and Upton's RBI double later in the sixth hiked the lead to 3-1 against Blackburn, who narrowly escaped being hit by a line drive hit by Joyce during the inning. The ball appeared to deflect off the pitcher's glove and rolled to shortstop for an infield single.	Shoppach put it out of reach with a first-pitch, two-run homer off Blackburn, who allowed five runs and 10 hits in six-plus innings.	"As I told the boys in there, this game doesn't give you anything. You have to take it," Gardenhire said. "We need to start taking a little more than we're giving."	Game notes	 Gardenhire hopes Mauer, who was placed on the DL because of leg weakness stemming from offseason arthroscopic surgery, will be able to return to the lineup in a couple of weeks. The 2009 AL MVP is expected to start a rehab program next week. ... Minnesota DH Jim Thome entered the game 2-for-2 with two homers lifetime against Davis. The slugger hit a fly ball to the warning track in center field in his first at-bat and finished 0 for 2 with a walk against the Rays' starter. He scored the Twins' first run when he drew the walk before Valencia's RBI double. ... Shoppach has three homers in 15 career at bats against Blackburn.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

HOUSTON --  The San Diego Padres were happy they didn't let another solid outing by a starting pitcher go to waste.	San Diego starter Aaron Harang (3-0) allowed three hits and one run with eight strikeouts in six innings, Chris Denorfia doubled and homered and Ryan Ludwick drove in a pair of runs in the Padres' three-run seventh inning as they beat the Houston Astros 4-2 on Friday night.	The Padres found their offense a day after Dustin Moseley allowed one run in 6 2/3 innings, but took the loss after San Diego was shutout for the third consecutive time with him on the mound.	Denorfia made it 1-0 with a solo homer in the fifth inning, giving the Padres their first run of the series after being shut out Thursday. Houston's Hunter Pence tied it with an RBI double in the sixth inning.	Nick Hundley singled before Denorfia's ground-rule double in the seventh. Ludwick's single to center field drove both players in and gave San Diego a 3-1 lead. Ludwick scored on a sacrifice fly to stretch the lead to 4-1.	"That ball's out of any park in the major league," Padres manager Bud Black said of Denorfia's homer. "That ball was crushed. That lightened up the dugout a little bit and then [Ludwick's] bullet into left center was a big blow."	Luke Gregerson allowed two hits in a scoreless seventh for San Diego and Mike Adams threw a perfect eighth. Closer Heath Bell gave up two hits and a run in the ninth for his third save.	"Good starting pitching, good defense, timely hitting and the guys in our bullpen come in and do the job," Black said. "It happened tonight."	Harang has pitched six innings and allowed one earned run in each of his three starts this season.	"I felt really good today," he said. "I hit my spots and I threw that slider pretty much any count. It felt like pitches were working."	Houston starter J.A. Happ (1-2) yielded seven hits and four runs in seven innings.	"I felt like I was throwing the ball well," Happ said. "I threw a couple balls in there in the seventh. They weren't necessarily bad pitches, but maybe they weren't executed the way I would have liked. It's frustrating."	Houston got two singles in the ninth inning before Carlos Lee scored on a force out by Chris Johnson to make it 4-2. Bell retired pinch-hitter Jason Michaels to end the game.	Denorfia's homer in the fifth inning bounced high on the wall in left field. Jason Bartlett reached on an error by Angel Sanchez with one out. Harang had a sacrifice bunt before Pence caught a flyball from Cameron Maybin for the third out.	Happ gave up a single to Orlando Hudson with one out in the sixth inning, but Houston turned a double play to escape that inning. Hudson extended his hitting streak to 11 games with the hit.	Michael Bourn singled in the first inning before Harang retired the next 10, striking out six. He didn't allow another baserunner until walking Pence with one out in the fourth inning. Pence stole second base with two outs before Harang fanned Brett Wallace to end the inning.	Bourn was the next Astro to get a hit with his single with one out sixth inning. Between Bourn's two singles, Harang retired 16 of 17 batters he faced.	"Aaron made quality pitches throughout the game," Black said of Harang. "He's pitching with aggressiveness and he's pitching with some confidence. It's great to see."	Pence scored Bourn with a line drive to left field that made it 1-all in the sixth inning. Bourn gave Houston its first hit since the first inning with his single with one out in the inning before swiping second base with two outs. It was his sixth stolen base of the season.	Game notes	 Hall of Famer Monte Irvin, who played both with and against Jackie Robinson, was in Houston to celebrate Jackie Robinson Day. He, along with several former Astros players met with current players Bourn, Bill Hall and Jason Bourgeois for a reception before the game. Irvin, who is 92, was pleased to take part in the celebration. "He was a wonderful pioneer," Irvin said. "He did a great job of integrating baseball and not only did he make it better in baseball, but he made it better in all the sports." ... Astros SS Clint Barmes, on the disabled list with a broken left hand, said his recovery is going well and will have X-rays on Monday with hopes to begin a rehabilitation stint in the minors soon.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CHICAGO --  Caught in a rain delay but not ready to leave the game, Jered Weaver had to improvise.	After play was halted in the sixth inning, Weaver put some heat packs on his arm, threw his No. 42 jersey in the dryer because there wasn't a spare around, then played catch in the hallway outside the clubhouse.	When Weaver came back, he wasn't as sharp as before, but he -- with some help from the Angels' bullpen -- was good enough to lead Los Angeles to a 4-3 win over the Chicago White Sox on Friday night	"That was kind of weird," Weaver said. "You can have a half-hour inning sometimes. It wasn't too bad. Just came up here and tried to stay warm."	Weaver stayed in the game, but gave up a two-run homer to Adam Dunn just two batters after retaking the mound.	"He doesn't miss many mistakes and that was a mistake on my part," Weaver said. "He put it where he should have. That's what he does."	The Angels' bullpen extended its scoreless streak to 25 1/3 innings behind Weaver (4-0) to seal the win.	Fernando Rodney worked out of trouble with two on and one out in the eighth and Jordan Walden worked a perfect ninth to preserve the win for Weaver, the first in the majors to reach four wins.	"We've got some guys who can throw the heck of the ball," Weaver said. "I'll take any of those guys coming in after me and they were able to get the job done tonight."	Maicer Izturis had three hits and drove in two runs Friday to help the Angels win their third straight and seventh in the past nine games.	Weaver (4-0) allowed three runs on four hits to earn the win. Two of the runs were earned. The 2010 strikeout leader added four to his 2011 total and leads the majors with 31 this season.	Filling in for the injured Jake Peavy, Phil Humber (1-1) took the loss for Chicago. He was charged with four runs over his five innings of work, but only two of the runs were earned. Humber struck out four and gave up six hits, but was hit hard all night.	"It was a battle," he said. "I didn't have control of most of my pitches for the most part."	Weaver retired the first six batters he faced, but found trouble in the third inning. He hit A.J. Pierzynski in the back on a 1-2 pitch to lead off and Alexei Ramirez blooped a single into shallow center field to put runners on first and second.	Brent Morel then botched a bunt, popping out to catcher Hank Conger. Juan Pierre followed with a flyout to left field, but Weaver couldn't escape unscathed. Gordon Beckham ripped a 1-1 pitch into left field to drive in Pierzynski. Weaver rebounded to strike out Dunn for the second time.	The Angels responded immediately with a four-run fourth. After a one-out walk to Vernon Wells and a single by Alberto Callaspo, Humber allowed an RBI single to Mark Trumbo. Conger then grounded softly to third with runners on first and third, but a wide throw by Morel allowed a run to score and set the stage for a two-run double off the bat of Izturis, his third hit in four innings, to give Los Angeles a 4-1 lead.	In addition to the delay in the sixth, there was a brief pause in the ninth as the Angels took the field for the bottom half.	Players briefly took shelter in the dugout, but reappeared just a minute later, before the grounds crew could take out the tarp, and began warming up again. Play resumed after just a three-minute delay.	"That's April baseball. You go on the road, you don't know what the elements are going to bring," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.	Game notes	 In honor of Jackie Robinson Day, Robinson's granddaughter, Sonia Pankey, threw out the first pitch. ... Angels RHP Joel Pineiro (right shoulder tendinitis) threw a 30-pitch bullpen session in Arizona Friday. "He still has work to do," Scioscia said. ... Angels LHP Scott Kazmir (lower back soreness) is working out in Houston but will join the team Monday for a three-game series in Arlington against the Texas Rangers. ... White Sox LHP Will Ohman struck out Izturis with the bases loaded and two out in the eighth.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  With the temperature hovering in the 30s, a steady rain and wind howling up to 24 miles per hour, Luke Hochevar felt right at home.	He held the Seattle Mariners to one hit for seven innings as the Kansas City Royals held on to win 6-5 on Friday night for their fifth victory in six games.	"It was definitely cold out there, but that's something you can't really think about," Hochevar said. "I like pitching in the cold. I really do. I think in really, really cold weather the pitcher has the upper hand. Growing up in Colorado I'm used to it.	"I felt like I got in a groove as the game went on. I gave myself a little more time before the game to get loose, knowing it was going to be chilly," he said.	Royals manager Ned Yost said his hands "were freezing" while making a pitching change in the Mariners' three-run ninth.	"It was bitter cold out there," Yost said. "It was a miserable night as I can remember, but it ended on a good note. Luke got on a real roll on a miserable night and got a bunch of ground balls. He pitched extremely well."	Ichiro Suzuki led off the game with a double, the only hit Hochevar (2-1) would allow. Suzuki advanced to third on a Milton Bradley ground out and scored on Jack Cust's fielder's choice grounder.	Hochevar, the first player picked in the 2006 draft, retired 16 in a row after walking Luis Rodriguez with two out in the second before exiting after seven innings and 100 pitches.	Jeff Francoeur led the Royals offense with three hits, including a homer, and three RBIs. He homered in the third after Billy Butler, who also had three hits, doubled. Francoeur's infield single in the first scored Chris Getz, who led off the inning with a walk.	"You know if you score a few runs you get an advantage because it's so cold and raining," Francoeur said. "Hochevar was phenomenal. They get nothing after Ichiro's hit. From there he rolled.	"I know he wasn't extremely happy with is first two starts, but the last two starts he's comeback and been throwing lights outs. For him to pound the strike zone like he did tonight was fun to play behind on a cold night," he said.	Mariners left-hander Erik Bedard (0-3), who missed all of last season after having his third shoulder surgery in as many years and has not won since June 7, 2009, took the loss.	He gave up five runs and seven hits in 4 2/3 innings. He walked three and struck out six.	Matt Treanor led off the fourth with a home run, giving the Royals a 4-1 lead. Bedard has given up six home runs in 13 2/3 innings in three starts.	The Royals added a run in the fifth when Mike Aviles double scored Francoeur, who had singled. Butler, who also had three hits, contributed a run-producing single in the sixth for the final Kansas City run.	Suzuki also had a RBI-single in the eighth, giving him a record 10 consecutive multi-hit games at Kauffman Stadium. Royals Hall of Famer George Brett held the record with nine straight multihit games at Kaufman Stadium in May, 1979.	After rookie left-hander Tim Collins walked the first two Mariners in the ninth, Joakim Soria was summoned and logged his fourth save in five opportunities but not before allowing three runs, including walking pinch-hitter Justin Smoak with the bases loaded. Soria, who has a 7.04 earned run average, allowed both inherited runners to score and gave up another run on two walks, a hit and a wild pitch.	"No excuses," Soria said. "It was just a bad outing for me. We got lucky in that one."	The Mariners, who have lost 10 of their past 12, are hitting .214 and have only 32 extra-base hits in 14 games.	"There's a lot of fight in these guys," Mariners manager Eric Wedge said. "We've still got to do a much better job with our at-bats. We're in a stretch right now, with our hitting, where it seems like every time we hit a ball hard, it's at somebody, or if we hit a ground ball it's at somebody. We're not finding too many holes right now. But, we can't put our heads down. We have to fight through it. We can't get caught up in what happened last year or what happened yesterday. We have to focus on today."	Game notes	 Mariners infielder Jack Wilson, who is in a 0-for-13 skid, was held out of the lineup. Rodriguez replaced Wilson at second place. ... Outfielder Mitch Maier started his first game of the season as Yost gave left fielder Alex Gordon a rest. Maier has five plate-appearances this season and has yet to put the ball in play -- three strikeouts and two walks. ... Mariners catcher Miguel Olivo went 0-for-4 with three strikeouts, extending his hitless streak to 25 at-bats with 11 strikeouts.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

DENVER --  A young, flamethrowing righty turned in a masterful performance for the Colorado Rockies.	And his name wasn't even Ubaldo Jimenez.	Jhoulys Chacin tossed a six-hitter for his first career complete game, Chris Iannetta hit a bases-clearing triple and the Rockies won their seventh straight, beating the Chicago Cubs 5-0 on Friday night.	The Rockies are off to their best start in franchise history, improving to 11-2 behind the performance of Chacin, who's picking up the slack quite nicely with Jimenez sidelined due to a cracked cuticle on his right thumb.	In windy and cool conditions, Chacin (3-0) struck out seven and walked two. He smacked his fist into his glove when the Rockies recorded a 5-4-3 double play to end the game.	With that, Chacin became the first Rockies pitcher to throw a complete-game shutout at Coors Field since Aaron Cook's gem July 1, 2008, against the San Diego Padres. Jimenez also had one on the road last May in San Francisco.	"I feel really happy for this," Chacin said. "It was big time."	Especially given the state of the bullpen.	Rockies right-handed relievers Huston Street and Felipe Paulino were off limits Friday after a taxing week. Not that they were even remotely needed, given the way Chacin threw.	"To have this kid step out there tonight and do what he did and basically give the entire group the night off, what a performance that was," Rockies manager Jim Tracy said. "He's capable of dominating games when he throws the ball and throws his fastball in the manner he did tonight."	Count Cubs manager Mike Quade among those impressed with the electric stuff of Chacin.	"What a good-looking young pitcher," Quade said, shaking his head. "To have that kind of repertoire in this kind of ball park and everything else, I mean he was good. I am impressed.	"I think a lot of us were victims of a good pitching performance," he said.	Matt Garza (0-2) turned in a third straight erratic performance, surrendering five runs and seven hits in six innings. That despite doing what most pitchers haven't been able to recently: Limit the damage done by Carlos Gonzalez and Troy Tulowitzki. The three and four hitters in Colorado's lineup were a combined 1-for-8 on the night.	"I gave up a big hit and that's what why I got beat," Garza said. "It's going to turn. It's going to turn. I know it's a long season. It's going to turn."	Garza's undoing on Friday was the second inning.	With the bases loaded, Iannetta hit a pitch from Garza to deep center that Marlon Byrd couldn't quite corral. All three runs scored and when Starlin Castro's relay throw to third ended up in the dugout, Iannetta sauntered home, too.	The rally was started with a single from Tulowitzki, one of the hottest hitters in the league.	The smooth-swinging shortstop had a torrid four-game series in New York against the Mets, going 10-for-16 with four homers and eight RBIs.	Tulowitzki took a little time to get his swing dialed in -- he started the season in an 0-for-9 funk after signing a lucrative long-term deal over the winter -- but now even his outs are loud. He entered the game leading the majors with seven homers.	He's putting together the type of tear like he had last September, when he hit 15 homers, a franchise record for a month.	Tulowitzki insists hitting isn't as easy as he's making it look right now.	"At any point and time, you can go south. I know that," Tulowitzki said. "Just trying to do what I do out there and trying to play the game hard."	The Rockies have switched around their starting rotation, pushing ace Jimenez's return to the mound back a day.	Jimenez, who's on the 15-day disabled list, was scheduled to throw Monday to open a three-game series with San Francisco.	Now, Esmil Rogers will face Tim Lincecum and the Giants, while Jimenez goes Tuesday.	Tracy said Friday the decision was made not so much because of the condition of Jimenez's cut on his pitching hand, but to keep Rogers on his regular pitching schedule.	"It's good. I don't feel any pain," Jimenez said before the game.	Game notes	 Cubs third baseman Aramis Ramirez finished with three hits. ... First base umpire Jerry Layne left the game in the second inning after being hit by a line drive in the left ankle. The crew chief walked off under his own power, heading straight into the clubhouse.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

PHOENIX --  Matt Cain has picked up right where he left off in a superb postseason.	The right-hander had his third strong outing in three appearances this season and Pablo Sandoval hit a three-run homer to lift the San Francisco Giants to their third straight victory, 5-2 over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Friday night.	Cain (2-0) allowed one run on four hits in six innings -- plus two batters. The right-hander threw six scoreless innings, then gave up a popup double down the right field line to Stephen Drew and hit Melvin Mora to end his night in the seventh. Drew later scored, just the third run charged to Cain in 19-plus innings this season.	"He's really, I think, grown so much over the past year and a half," manager Bruce Bochy said of a pitcher that he believes now ranks among the best in the National League. "He's carried what he did in the postseason to this year, that's mixing up pitches, quality strikes. He's got a good changeup going and good poise out there."	Cain threw 21 1/3 innings without allowing an earned run in the Giants' postseason run to the World Series title.	"I definitely go back to the postseason where I mentally was and try to use that to my advantage," he said.	Arizona manager Kirk Gibson said Cain "throws at least three pitches and throws them at any count."	"He is very unpredictable," Gibson said. "He knows he can pitch and he knows he is good. He comes right at you with good stuff. We aren't the only guys he has beat up on."	Sandoval's third homer of the year, on a changeup in the middle of the plate off Daniel Hudson in the first inning, provided all the offense the Giants needed. Sandoval also walked and scored in the first of Miguel Tejada's two doubles.	"I just tried to get a good pitch to hit," Sandoval said, "get relaxed at the plate and get a good pitch you can hit."	Bochy said Sandoval has secured the No. 5 spot in the batting order against right-handed pitchers.	Hudson (0-3) matched his career high with 10 strikeouts but allowed five runs, four earned, on six hits and three walks in six innings. He has received one run of support in his three starts this season.	Brian Wilson came on with runners at first and second and two outs in the ninth. He gave up an RBI single to Willie Bloomquist before getting slumping Kelly Johnson to pop out for his third save in four tries.	With one out in the first, Freddy Sanchez singled off the glove of third baseman Melvin Mora, then Buster Posey singled up the middle to bring up Sandoval. With two outs, on a 1-0 pitch, the still big -- but not as big as before after an offseason conditioning program -- hit a towering shot over the swimming pool in right field to put the Giants up 3-0.	San Francisco added one in the fourth when Sandoval drew a leadoff walk, Brandon Belt singled and Tejada doubled down the left field line. Cain followed with a low liner to right fielder Justin Upton, who made the catch and threw home as Belt was held at third. Upton had two singles off Cain.	The Giants scored an unearned run in the fifth. After Aubrey Huff walked and Posey singled, San Francisco went with a double-steal. Catcher Miguel Montero threw wild to third allowing a runner to score and make it 5-0.	After Cain departed in the seventh, left-hander Jeremy Affeldt fanned Montero but walked pinch-hitter Xavier Nagy to load the bases. Bloomquist's RBI sacrifice fly off reliever Ramon Ramirez ended the shutout.	Game notes	 Giants RHP Tim Lincecum is donating $25,000 to the Bryan Stow Fund to benefit the San Francisco fan critically injured in an attack following the season opener at Dodger Stadium on March 31. ... Bloomquist stole his seventh base of the season. ... Hudson got his third hit in five at-bats. ... Johnson robbed Sanchez of a hit with a sliding catch behind first base to start the fifth. ... Johnson was 0 for 5 to fall to .157 for the season. ... The Giants lead all NL West teams with 151 home runs at Chase Fields.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  Jim Leyland received a pile of five new cigars on his clubhouse desk and a celebratory bottle of champagne each from his general manager and coaching staff. The calls of congratulations began flooding in, too.	Leyland stuck to his usual postgame choice of cigarettes, then the no-nonsense skipper praised his players for his latest milestone.	Brennan Boesch hit a go-ahead two-run double with the bases loaded in the 10th inning and the Detroit Tigers rallied to beat the Oakland Athletics 8-4 on Friday night for Leyland's 1,500th career managerial win.	"I wouldn't have gotten this win tonight if I didn't have the players. It's all about the players and it always will be," Leyland said.	Miguel Cabrera hit a tying solo homer leading off the ninth against fill-in closer Brian Fuentes (0-2), who blew his first save in six chances and then loaded the bases with one out in the 10th.	The A's defense didn't help his cause, committing three errors in Detroit's seven-run 10th to raise their majors-leading total to 16. That includes seven in the last four games.	Leyland became the 19th major league manager to reach 1,500 wins, doing so on his first attempt.	"I'm just getting old, that's probably what that means," Leyland said.	Boesch finished with three hits for Detroit, which won its fourth straight.	Brayan Villarreal (1-0) recorded two outs in the ninth for the win. Oakland scored three in the 10th but still fell short.	Victor Martinez added an insurance run in the 10th with an RBI single, then two more runs came in on third baseman Andy LaRoche's wild throw home.	Fuentes, who has been Oakland's ninth-inning option in place of injured 2009 Rookie of the Year closer Andrew Bailey, was tagged for six runs, three earned.	"I'm just trying to get on base there. You have to have the confidence in yourself to do it every time you come to the plate," Cabrera said.	The Tigers turned double plays in each of the first two innings and again in the ninth on the way to winning their fourth straight at the Coliseum.	A's starter Brandon McCarthy struck out seven in 6 2/3 shutout innings and walked only his second batter in three starts, but David DeJesus' RBI single wasn't enough to hold up for the A's a night after being shut out for the first time on a three-hitter by Phil Coke and three relievers in a 3-0 Detroit win.	McCarthy showed again his value at the back end of a talented young rotation. He struck out seven or more for the seventh time in his career and first since May 13, 2009, for Texas against Seattle.	But the defense was awful.	"A couple of freak little plays in the infield that happened and we were able to blow it open," Leyland said.	A night after three of Oakland's four pitchers combined to allow a season-high 11 walks, six of those by Gio Gonzalez, McCarthy found the plate. Five of the six hits he allowed came with two outs, and he was able to keep the Tigers off balance before the bullpen fizzled. The A's are 1-4 at home so far.	"The defense will be good when it's all said and done," manager Bob Geren said. "It wasn't even a bad game, it was a bad inning. ... We need to score more runs and make it where every single pitch is not that tense, is not that tight."	McCarthy, who earned the A's No. 5 job in the rotation out of spring training after a tough competition, was in position to win back-to-back starts in the majors for the first time since September 2009.	Righty reliever Al Alburquerque made his major league debut for the Tigers in the seventh a day after being called up from Triple-A Toledo. He struck out three and allowed a single to Kurt Suzuki in his first two innings, then allowed Willingham's leadoff walk in the ninth.	Daniel Schlereth relieved and retired Hideki Matsui on a popup before Villarreal entered.	Matsui stranded five baserunners in his 0-for-4 night.	Don Kelly doubled with two outs in the fourth, the Tigers' 14th straight game with at least one double and their longest such streak to begin a season since also doing so in 14 in a row in 1970.	Tigers starter Rick Porcello made significant progress in six solid innings after allowing five runs on nine hits in five innings in each of his previous two starts.	Detroit pitchers haven't allowed a home run in their last eight games, matching the club's longest such streak since an eight-game run June 3-11, 1981.	Game notes	 Struggling leadoff hitter Austin Jackson was out of Detroit's starting lineup one night after going hitless in four at-bats while dropping his average to .184. The Tigers CF took extra batting practice. ... Tigers RHP Ryan Perry, out since April 5 with an infected eye, gave up three hits and two earned runs in 1 1/3 innings with one strikeout in a rehab outing for Triple-A Toledo. He threw 27 pitches, 20 for strikes and left after giving up consecutive one-out singles in the seventh. ... SS Jhonny Peralta also didn't start because of his 1-for-18 record against McCarthy. He pinch-hit in the 10th. ... Bailey (strained right forearm) is set to throw long toss Saturday followed by a side session Sunday. ... Oakland RHP Michael Wuertz (hamstring) will pitch one inning for Class-A Stockton on Saturday. ... Cabrera received a continuance for a routine court date in his DUI and resisting arrest case until June 10. Cabrera requested it and prosecutors agreed. Cabrera -- who didn't need to be in court but only represented by a lawyer -- was arrested Feb. 16 in Ft. Pierce, Fla., and charged with DUI and resisting an officer.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

LOS ANGELES --  The way Lance Berkman sees it, the hot-hitting Cardinals are simply realizing their potential for power at the same time.	Albert Pujols and Berkman each homered in consecutive at-bats and St. Louis sent the Los Angeles Dodgers to their fourth consecutive loss, 11-2 on Friday night.	The Cardinals' offense continued unabated as they reached .500 for the first time this season, with five wins in their past six games. They battered the Dodgers' staff for 19 hits a night after winning the series opener 9-5 and collecting 16 hits.	"If you look at the back of everybody's baseball card and figure, 'Well, if they hit to their potential,' you've got the recipe for a really good offense," Berkman said. "Just like we weren't too distraught about having a couple of tough games at the beginning of the season, we're not going to pat ourselves on the back too much for having a few games where we swung the bats well."	In their five games since Monday -- three against Arizona -- the Cardinals have hit 13 homers and scored 51 runs. They've had 14 or more hits in five consecutive games for the first time since Aug. 31-Sept. 7, 1930, when they did so in six straight.	"It's a burst and it's not something that you can look to continue every game the rest of the season," Berkman said. "That was predicted to be a strength of this team coming into the season and it's good to see we've been able to string some games here where that's been the case."	The Cardinals' offensive power extended to the bottom of their lineup, too. Yadier Molina had four hits -- all singles -- and starter Kyle Lohse singled, too.	Lohse (2-1) allowed two runs and six hits in 7 1/3 innings. The right-hander struck out six, including Aaron Miles in the seventh for his 1,000th career strikeout, and walked one.	"I didn't have my best stuff," Lohse said. "I was able to get it going once we put runs on the board. The big thing was to not let them get in it."	Jon Garland (0-1) struggled in his season debut, giving up nine hits and five runs in four-plus innings. The right-hander, who struck out two and walked none, came off the disabled list earlier in the day after straining his left oblique March 9.	Berkman homered into the lower right-field seats on Garland's first pitch of the second inning. David Freese scored from third base on a balk by Garland -- the first of his career -- and Ryan Theriot hit an RBI single for a 3-0 lead.	"I still don't think it's a balk," Garland said. "He said I started [toward the plate], which is weird because when I start to go back into my set [position], I go back, and he said I went forward. So I think maybe he blinked and then saw me turn because I turn and look at the runner every time someone's on base. And until you're set, you can do that."	Berkman homered again leading off the fourth for his second multihomer game since Monday.	"They seem to be hitting everything thrown up there, and they're doing a pretty damn good job of it," Garland said.	Pujols hit a two-run shot in the fifth against Kenley Jansen that extended the Cardinals' lead to 5-2 after Colby Rasmus chased Garland with a leadoff double. Pujols then led off the seventh with a homer to straightaway center field off Blake Hawksworth, making it 7-2.	"Albert is going to have a great year if he stays healthy," Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said. "He gets pitched so tough. He now has a lot of help in the lineup."	The Dodgers scored both their runs in the fourth on Matt Kemp's RBI single and a wild pitch by Lohse with two outs.	Game notes	 Pujols had his 40th career multihomer game and first since last September. ... Dodgers RF Andre Ethier extended his hitting streak to 12 games with an infield single in the fourth. ... Don Newcombe, a former teammate of Jackie Robinson on the Dodgers, threw out the first pitch to Kemp on the annual day baseball honored the player who broke the sport's color barrier 64 years ago.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CLEVELAND -- Orlando Cabrera senses something special happening to the Cleveland Indians. In 13 major league seasons, he's seen this before.	With each quality start, clutch hit and win, the Indians' confidence grows. Cabrera sees a young team blossoming into a quality one.	"I think we have what it takes," he said.	To do what?	"To win," he said. "I don't like to compete. I like to win."	That's exactly what the Indians are doing.	Josh Tomlin delivered yet another quality start for Cleveland, Cabrera drove in four runs and the first-place Indians won their sixth straight at home, 8-3 on Saturday over the Baltimore Orioles, who have lost six in a row and are having trouble scoring.	Tomlin (3-0) gave up two runs -- solo homers to Jake Fox and Luke Scott -- and six hits in six innings. His outing continued a dominant run by Cleveland's starters, who are making it look easy. In the last 12 games, they're 8-1 with a 1.91 ERA, not bad for a five-man rotation of virtual unknowns.	After dropping their first two games, the Indians have won 10 of 12. Cabrera, signed as a free agent to fill the Indians' hole at second base and bring leadership to their clubhouse, has been impressed by the strong start but wants to see more.	"We haven't had to fight back yet," he said. "I want to see us fight back late in the game."	The Indians haven't had to. They've been jumping out to early leads, scoring 42 of their 75 runs in the first four innings. The nice starts have allowed their pitchers to relax and not have to worry about being perfect. So far, it's been a nearly foolproof formula as Cleveland is 8-1 when scoring first.	"It means the world," manager Manny Acta said of the early runs. "Everybody wants to pitch with a lead. It really gives guys more confidence to throw the ball over the plate and challenge guys. It's been huge."	Shin-Soo Choo homered off Jeremy Guthrie (1-2) and Matt LaPorta had two RBIs for the Indians, who are 10-4 and off to their best start in nine years. Travis Hafner and Travis Buck had three hits each for Cleveland.	It's been a great start for the Indians and it could soon get better as the club is expected to activate center fielder Grady Sizemore from the disabled list in the next two days. The three-time All-Star has been out nearly a year following a knee injury.	Since opening 4-0, the Orioles have lost seven of nine and their six-game slide is the club's longest since Buck Showalter took over as manager on Aug. 3. Baltimore has scored just 15 runs in the skid, and once again didn't take advantage of some scoring chances.	"It's not the gloom and doom everybody makes it out to be," Showalter said. "We had opportunities we didn't take advantage of. It's been a challenge for us. We'll get better at that."	Tomlin won the only open spot in Cleveland's rotation during spring training, and the right-hander's shown no signs he'll give it up. He coasted through the first few innings, allowing only the two homers before working in and out of a tricky situation in the fifth.	He gave up a leadoff homer to Scott that made it 6-2 and then made an error on Adam Jones' bunt. The Orioles eventually loaded the bases with one out, but Tomlin got Brian Roberts to pop out and retired Nick Markakis on a groundout.	"I knew I had to make that pitch and I was able to," said Tomlin, who was pulled after 79 pitches but didn't disagree with Acta's decision to take him out.	Acta said Tomlin was "one pitch from disaster."	"I was," Tomlin said.	The Orioles made it 6-3 in the seventh on Roberts' RBI single, but failed to push more than one run across despite having runners at first and third with none out. Indians reliever Vinnie Pestano got Markakis to hit into a double play and struck out Derrek Lee to preserve Cleveland's three-run lead.	Cabrera made it swell to five runs in the seventh with his second homer.	The 36-year-old has been to the playoffs six times in the past seven years. He acknowledged its too early to think that far ahead, but he is seeing a team that's beginning to understand what it takes to win.	"I like to win," he said. "I do think we have what it takes and I think the guys have the confidence every day to come and get a 'W' every night. You can see the smiles on their faces."	Game notes	 Tomlin has pitched at least five innings in each of his first 15 major league starts, the first pitcher in Cleveland history to do that. ... Steady rain followed by a thunderstorm delayed the start of the game for 2 hours, 3 minutes. ... Scott made a sliding catch in the left-field corner to rob Choo of extra bases in the seventh, and Jones made a leaping catch at the center-field wall in front of Cleveland's bullpen to steal a double or better from Brantley in the fourth. ... According to the Elias Sports Bureau, the Indians were the first team in AL history to win eight straight games after starting 0-2.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK --  Freddy Garcia's first scheduled start this season was wiped out by rain. The weather wasn't much better when he finally got another chance to take the mound.	Garcia allowed two hits over six innings in his Yankees debut, Mark Teixeira drove in three runs and New York held off the Texas Rangers 5-2 on a bone-chilling Saturday in the Bronx.	With temperatures in the mid-40s, Garcia (1-0) worked through steady rain showers and winds gusting to 30 mph to shut down the Texas offense. The only hits the veteran right-hander allowed were to Adrian Beltre in the first and David Murphy in the fourth.	"He pitched really good," said Robinson Cano, who added a two-run homer in the eighth for the Yankees. "He waited a long time for this."	The Yankees' fifth starter, Garcia was supposed to start last week against the Minnesota Twins. When rain postponed the game, the well-traveled Garcia was pushed back more than a week, relegated once again to playing long toss and throwing bullpen sessions.	It sure must have kept him sharp. He needed to throw only 84 pitches against Texas.	"I'm really happy, thankful for starting," said Garcia, who did toss an inning of relief against Boston on April 10. "I've been waiting a couple of weeks and it came out good."	He turned over a three-run lead to the bullpen, and Joba Chamberlain got through the seventh without trouble before Rafael Soriano struggled again in his new eighth-inning role.	The former Tampa Bay closer allowed run-scoring singles by Elvis Andrus and Michael Young that made it 3-2, and nearly a three-run homer by Beltre -- the deep flyball landed in the seats just outside the right-field foul pole. Beltre eventually grounded into a double play.	"I'm sticking my head out and I thought it was foul, and I'm glad they called it that way," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "The wind was blowing that way."	Mariano Rivera worked around Yorvit Torrealba's double in the ninth for his sixth save.	Derek Holland (2-1) pitched well for Texas, allowing five runs in 7 2/3 innings. The young left-hander baffled the Yankees in the AL championship series last fall, tossing 5 2/3 innings of scoreless relief, but lost for the third time in three starts against New York.	The Rangers (10-4) lost for the third time in four games overall.	"Derek did a great job," manager Ron Washington said. "He really just made two mistakes."	Perhaps expecting rain to force an early finish, New York wasted little time taking the lead. Nick Swisher lashed a single up the middle in the first, and Teixeira promptly drove a 3-2 pitch into the right-field bleachers to give New York the lead. It was his fifth homer of the season after going hitless in four at-bats in the series opener Friday night.	The Yankees scored again in the third, when Derek Jeter walked on four pitches to start the inning. He went to third on Swisher's double and scored on Teixeira's sacrifice fly.	The Rangers never threatened against Garcia, going down in order in the first, third, fourth and sixth innings on an array of splitters, changeups and looping curveballs.	"Freddy used to be all power," Washington said. "He was smart in the way that he pitched. You've got to give him credit, especially against an aggressive team like ours."	The veteran starter got plenty of help from his defense, too, including a nifty diving stop by Alex Rodriguez on a hard groundball in the third inning, and a sliding grab on the wet grass by Swisher in the fifth inning that may have saved a run.	Rodriguez left in the seventh inning with what the team called lower back and oblique stiffness. No medical tests were planned, though Girardi wasn't sure whether he'll play Sunday.	"His lower right side was stiff," Girardi said. "We'll see how he is tomorrow."	Game notes	 Holland matched a career high with 118 pitches. ... Yankees C Francisco Cervelli (broken foot) played an extended spring training game Saturday in Tampa, Fla. ... RHP Carlos Silva had his first bullpen session Saturday since agreeing to a minor league deal with New York on April 9. Silva was released by the Cubs in spring training. ...

BOSTON --  Josh Beckett's fine start has been overshadowed by Boston's miserable opening to this season.	Beckett had his second straight strong outing, holding Toronto to one run over seven innings, and Jed Lowrie provided a spark at the top of Boston's lineup with a two-run homer to lift the struggling Red Sox to a 4-1 victory over the Blue Jays on Saturday.	The 30-year old right-hander, coming off an injury-plagued 2010 season when he went just 6-6 with a 5.78 ERA, overpowered the New York Yankees six days ago and followed it up with a nearly equally impressive outing.	Pitching in chilly conditions, with wind chills in the mid-30s and a stiff breeze blowing in from right field, Beckett allowed two baserunners in an inning only once. It came when the Blue Jays scored their only run against him.	"I definitely pushed myself a little bit more. I definitely felt good today," he said. "That was one of the things where on a day game like today, where maybe the energy is down a little bit. That's a way of picking myself up."	Beckett, a big part of Boston's run to the 2007 World Series, missed more than two months last season while sidelined with a strained back.	"He definitely should feel good about himself the first three outings," said Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek, who has caught Beckett the past two starts. "At least he's had his health to build on that since spring training."	Beckett, reserved like usual after a good outing, feels as if he's overcome last season's troubles for now.	"I think execution-wise and health-wise and everything, I definitely think my last two starts were a notch above what I was most of the year last year," he said.	The win snapped a three-game losing streak for the Red Sox, who have the major's worst record at 3-10.	Travis Snider had an RBI single and stole a pair of bases for the Blue Jays. Toronto lost for the sixth time in nine games.	Lowrie, inserted into the leadoff spot to replace struggling outfielder Carl Crawford, went 3-for-5 to raise his average to .500. He had seen limited playing time, getting 17 at-bats before the start.	"The hits are there right now," Lowrie said. "That's nice. But it all comes down to preparation. I'm really happy with my preparation."	Beckett (2-1), coming off a dominant outing in which he shut out the Yankees with 10 strikeouts over eight innings in a win last Sunday, looked sharp from the start. He used a nasty curveball to go with his fastball to hold the Blue Jays to a pair of singles and a double. He struck out nine and walked two.	Daniel Bard gave up a hit in the eighth and Jonathan Papelbon got the final three outs for his second save.	"The way Beckett was throwing the baseball, a couple of runs obviously would have stood up," Blue Jays manager John Farrell said. "We had a couple of opportunities late, but it was not a day where we could generate a whole lot of offense."	The Red Sox scored a pair of runs in the first, but it could have been more after they loaded the bases before Jo-Jo Reyes (0-2) got an out. Lowrie opened with a single, Dustin Pedroia walked and Adrian Gonzalez followed with an RBI single. Kevin Youkilis then doubled in a run, making it 2-0. After David Ortiz walked to load the bases, Reyes struck out a pair and got Darnell McDonald to ground out.	Reyes gave up four runs, seven hits, walked five and fanned three while throwing 94 pitches in four innings. He felt the key was that the right-handed hitters were able to solidly hit pitches away after he couldn't work them inside.	"I couldn't throw down and in on a righty, everything was away, so I think they keyed on it," he said.	The Blue Jays cut it to 2-1 on Snider's RBI single in the second.	Boston made it 4-1 in the second when Lowrie homered into the Green Monster seats after Jacoby Ellsbury was hit by a pitch.	Game notes	 The 2-10 start had matched Boston's worst in club history, last done in 1996. They also opened 1925 and '27 by losing 10 of the initial 12. Crawford, off to a .137 start after signing a seven-year, $142-millon contract during the offseason, was taken out of the lineup for the day. "I think it'll do him a lot better to get a day off," Red Sox manager Terry Francona said. McDonald started in left and had a single in three at-bats. ... Boston 1B Gonzalez made three diving stops on hard grounders by Corey Patterson. ... Twenty-two years ago Saturday, Kelly Gruber became the first Blue Jays player to hit for the cycle. ... Fans lined the field on the warning track before the game as Red Sox players walked around and posed for pictures for about 45 minutes. ... Blue Jays SS Yunel Escobar had reached safely in 11 straight games, but went 0-for-4. ... Toronto LHP Luis Perez made his major league debut.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  A handwritten sign hastily taped above the little corner of the Royals clubhouse where Sean O'Sullivan and three relievers have their locker stalls told the story:	"Shut Out Wall."	That's what it said, and that's what they did. O'Sullivan, making his first start of the year, combined with relievers Tim Collins, Jeremy Jeffress and Aaron Crow to blank the slumping Mariners 7-0 Saturday, continuing a surprising getaway that's vaulted the Royals into first place in the AL Central.	"You've got to give credit to the rest of the guys in this locker room and the way they're playing the game," said O'Sullivan (1-1). It's fun to show up at the park right now."	Alex Gordon had three hits, raising his league-leading total to 22, and drove in two runs and Mike Aviles had three RBIs as the Royals beat 2010 Cy Young winner Felix Hernandez and handed the Mariners their 11th loss in 13 games.	"The bullpen did a great job," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "They shut the door on everything. Collins has three pitches he can use to get big league hitters out. Jeffress can overpower you. And Crow's been dynamite. It was a great job pitching-wise all the way around."	O'Sullivan threw five shutout innings, allowing five hits and two walks, striking out four. He was helped by shortstop Alcides Escobar's run-saving defensive play on a hard-hit grounder by Ichiro Suzuki, who was 0 for 5 and had his Kauffman Stadium hitting streak stopped at 16 games.	Only two of the five runs charged against Hernandez (1-2) were earned. He took his second straight loss after going five innings and giving up six hits. He walked two and struck out six.	Seattle manager Eric Wedge kept the clubhouse closed for several minutes while he talked to his slumping team.	"I had a few choice words for them," he said. "I'm not real happy right now. I made it very clear as to how we're going to go about our business."	The Mariners stranded 11 runners and were 0 for 9 with runners in scoring position.	"We just didn't play good baseball at all today. That's what [ticks] me off more than anything," Wedge said.	Gordon extended his hitting streak to 10 games, longest active in this majors this year, with a leadoff single in the fourth and eventually scored on Melky Cabrera's sacrifice fly.	In the fifth, third baseman Chone Figgins was charged with an error when Escobar's sharply hit grounder skipped over his glove. With two outs, Chris Getz singled and Gordon delivered a two-run double over the head of center fielder Ryan Langerhans. Billy Butler followed with an RBI single for a 5-0 lead. Gordon added a single in the eighth and came around on Aviles' two-run double off Brandon League.	Collins threw a shutout inning, Jeffress threw two scoreless innings and Crow worked a 1-2-3 ninth.	"The bullpen's been phenomenal," said O'Sullivan. "It's been a come-in-and-lock-the-door deal. They've been great."	In the Seattle third, with Brendan Ryan on second with a double, Suzuki hit a hard grounder up the middle. It looked like an RBI single but Escobar dived to his left, stopped the ball and jumped to his feet to throw out one of the fastest runners in the league. Ryan stopped at third and was stranded when Figgins hit a routine grounder to Escobar.	"Man, that was huge. Huge!" said O'Sullivan. "He hit it, it went past my feet and I'm going, 'OK, that's through the middle for sure.' It had a little heat on it. It wasn't a chopper. For him to get to that ball and get to his feet quick enough to make the throw was great."	Cabrera doubled in the second and scored on Aviles' RBI single.	The Mariners loaded the bases with one out in the fourth on two singles and a walk. But O'Sullivan retired Michael Saunders on a shallow flyball to left and struck out Chris Gimenez.	Game notes	 Collins gave up a walk and a double but struck out the side in the sixth. ... Figgins practically knocked Jeffress down with a line drive in the seventh that rocketed into the surprised reliever's glove. The rookie reliever struck out Saunders in the eighth with a 100 mph fastball. ... Seattle's Josh Lueke retired the side in the seventh on four pitches. ... Seattle C Miguel Olivo, on an 0-for-25 slump, was out of the lineup.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CINCINNATI --  Ramon Hernandez got one right there.	Looking for a pitch he could hit into the outfield for a sacrifice fly, the Reds catcher got one he could hit a long way. He broke open a close game with his sixth career grand slam, and Cincinnati overpowered the Pirates 11-2 on Saturday, sending Pittsburgh to its fifth loss in six games.	"We scored a lot of runs today," Hernandez said. "Especially after [getting] just one run last night, it gives you a little confidence back."	Hernandez's fifth-inning homer was his third hit off James McDonald (0-1), who let a tied game get away quickly. The Reds sent 10 batters to the plate for seven runs in the inning, capped by Drew Stubbs' two-run homer.	Jonny Gomes also had a solo shot and a two-run homer. The Reds matched their season high with four homers, hours after falling to the Pirates 6-1 in the series opener.	"This team has a real short memory," said Gomes, who leads the Reds with five homers and 15 walks. "We left the double doors and came back and put some pretty good swings on the ball. With the cool weather and the wind, you don't know what's going to happen."	Mike Leake (2-0) was a little off with his control in an unexpected start. He filled in for Edinson Volquez, who was pushed back a day because of a stiff neck. Leake gave up four hits and walked four in six innings.	Pittsburgh's pitching has been its strength during the first two weeks, allowing the Pirates to get off to an encouraging start despite their weak offense. Neither one did much of anything on Saturday.	The Reds have led the NL Central since opening day with an offense among the league's best. They got rolling against McDonald on a brisk, windy afternoon -- 50 degrees with light showers. The right-hander allowed nine hits and a pair of walks in only 4 1/3 innings.	Hernandez smacked McDonald's 90th and final pitch, an up-and-in fastball, into the upper deck in left for his grand slam. Both of the catcher's homers this season have turned games. He had a two-out, three-run homer in the bottom of the ninth inning for a 7-6 win over Milwaukee on Opening Day.	"I was trying to hit the ball in the air," Hernandez said. "I guess I got lucky. I got a pitch over the plate and handled it pretty good."	McDonald suffered through one bad inning for the second consecutive start. He gave up four first-inning runs during a 6-5 loss to Colorado last Sunday.	"I had a bad game," McDonald said. "A lot of balls weren't going exactly where I wanted them to. I was off."	Gomes hit a solo homer in the second and a two-run shot in the sixth off Joe Beimel, the ninth multihomer game of his career. Gomes leads the Reds with five homers and 15 walks.	National League MVP Joey Votto had a triple among his three hits, raising his average to .451.	Stubbs' two-run shot off Mike Crotta completed the seven-run rally in the fifth inning and marked the first homer allowed by the Pirates' bullpen this season. Pittsburgh and Philadelphia had the only bullpens in the majors that hadn't given up a homer.	Pirates manager Clint Hurdle went with essentially the same lineup that won the series opener 6-1 on Friday night. It failed to get much out of its best chance against Leake, who needed 102 pitches to get through six innings. Pittsburgh got three walks and a single in the fourth, all with one out, but managed only a pair of runs.	"Luckily, I was able to only give up two runs that inning. I was able to minimize the damage," Leake said. "I tried to make some pitches, but I got away from myself."	Game notes	 In his first appearance since being called up from the minors, Beimel gave up two hits and two runs in one inning. ... Reds 2B Brandon Phillips got a second straight day to rest his sore groin. He might play on Sunday. ... RH Johnny Cueto made his first rehab assignment start while recovering from a tight shoulder, going 3 1/3 innings for Triple-A Louisville. He gave up two hits and two runs, throwing 55 pitches. ... 3B Juan Francisco twisted his left leg while completing his swing for a single in the eighth, then limped to first base. He left the game with a cramp in his calf.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ATLANTA --  Derek Lowe was grateful the Braves pulled out their best power game of the young season for another series-opening win.	Alex Gonzalez hit two of Atlanta's four solo homers and the Braves finally provided some offense for Lowe, beating the skidding New York Mets 4-2 on Saturday in the opener of a doubleheader.	Chipper Jones and Freddie Freeman also connected for the Braves, who had six hits.	The four homers were a season high for Atlanta and the most for the team since hitting four in a 16-5 win over the Chicago Cubs on Aug. 22, 2010.	"It was good, it was needed," Lowe said. "It was kind of a struggle, a lot of line drives at people. I was not as sharp as I have been."	Lowe (2-2) gave up two runs and five hits in six innings. He has a 1.82 ERA this season, but lost his previous two starts as the Braves were shut out by Milwaukee and Philadelphia.	The Braves are 5-0 in series openers, but 1-8 in all other games.	"We need to get a couple guys on base and hit the home run," manager Fredi Gonzalez said.	D.J. Carrasco (0-1) gave up four hits, including three homers, in 3 2/3 innings as a fill-in starter for New York, which lost its sixth straight game. The Mets were playing their second doubleheader in three days after getting swept by Colorado at home on Thursday.	"I felt good," Carrasco said. "It was an opportunity to give our bullpen a little bit of rest and help them out a little bit."	The Mets have lost nine of 10 after winning three of their first four games. New manager Terry Collins noted the latest loss was competitive.	"I'd rather watch this than 11-0," Collins said, referring to a defeat at Philadelphia on April 7.	Before the game, the Mets placed right-hander Chris Young on the 15-day disabled list with biceps tendinitis in his pitching arm. They did not immediately announce a replacement for Young to start on Sunday.	Craig Kimbrel worked the ninth to earn his fourth save. With two outs, he gave up an infield single to Jose Reyes before getting Angel Pagan on a fly to center.	The series opener was postponed by rain Friday night. The Mets were playing consecutive doubleheaders for the first time since Aug. 20-21, 1998, against St. Louis. Club officials called the commissioner's office Friday night, hoping to avoid a second straight twinbill, but the makeup game remained.	Mike Pelfrey started the nightcap for New York against Jair Jurrjens.	Players wore No. 42 jerseys as part of baseball's annual tribute to Jackie Robinson, originally planned for Friday night. Among those wearing No. 42 was Mets left fielder Willie Harris who, like Robinson, was born in Cairo, Ga.	Harris drove in Carlos Beltran with a double off Lowe in the sixth, cutting it to 3-2. Josh Thole had a single and scored on Reyes' grounder in the fifth.	The Braves began the day with 11 homers in 13 games.	Alex Gonzalez has 16 of his 140 career homers against the Mets, more than any other team.	Jones, whose history of success against the Mets is no secret, began the day with a .319 career batting average against New York. The homer was his 45th against the Mets, matching his total against the Phillies.	Collins was pulling for Carrasco to last at least five innings, but the right-hander faded with two outs in the fourth. He gave up Alex Gonzalez's second homer of the game before walking Freeman and Lowe.	"He kept us in the game, gave us a chance," Collins said.	Ryota Igarashi replaced Carrasco and ended the inning on Martin Prado's fly to center.	Left-hander Pat Misch, recalled from Triple-A Buffalo, pitched two innings, giving up Freeman's first homer of the season to make it 4-2.	After the game, the Braves placed right-hander Peter Moylan on the 15-day disabled list with a lower back strain, clearing a roster spot for Jurrjens.	Jurrjens had been on the disabled list with an oblique injury.	NOTES: Brian McCann and Dan Uggla were presented with their 2010 Silver Slugger Awards before the game. Tim Hudson collected his award for NL comeback player of the year. ... The Braves recalled RHP Jairo Asencio from Triple-A Gwinnett. C J.C. Boscan was sent back to Gwinnett. ... Mets LF Jason Bay, on the disabled list with a strained left rib cage, was to play a rehab game for Class A St. Lucie on Saturday night and could join the team on Tuesday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CHICAGO --  With six commemorative game balls sitting in his locker, Tyler Chatwood appeared stoic on the outside.	On the inside, he was ecstatic.	Chatwood pitched seven impressive innings for his first major league win and Hank Conger hit a three-run homer to lead the Los Angeles Angels over the Chicago White Sox 7-2 on Saturday.	"What you saw tonight is what we saw in Tyler," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "He had a couple of good changeups and some good curveballs, but everything is set up on his fastball command."	With starters Scott Kazmir and Joel Pineiro on the disabled list, the Angels have turned to Chatwood, who dropped a 4-0 decision to the Cleveland Indians in his debut Monday.	"I felt better today," Chatwood said. "Nerves were gone. I just felt more confident."	After the start was delayed more than 2 hours by rain, the 21-year-old rookie allowed just one run and five hits. The lone blemish was Carlos Quentin's fifth-inning homer, his third of the season and the 100th of his career.	Howie Kendrick also homered and drove in three runs for the Angels. Leadoff man Maicer Izturis had three hits.	Gavin Floyd (1-1) took the loss, yielding six runs and eight hits over six innings. He threw three wild pitches and allowed hits to the leadoff batter in each of the first four innings.	"The two home runs got him," White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen said. "He got men at second base with less than two out for three innings in a row. He battled."	Paul Konerko hit his fourth homer for Chicago, a solo shot with two outs in the ninth to end a 1-for-16 slide.	Chatwood (1-1) retired 10 of his first 13 batters and induced three double plays. He struck out three. The right-hander gave up four runs over five innings Monday against Cleveland.	Izturis has 14 hits in his past 26 at-bats against the White Sox, getting hits in seven consecutive meetings. He is 6-for-10 in the series.	After Vernon Wells doubled to lead off the second and advanced to third on a fly ball, Floyd retired Mark Trumbo on a groundout and had a two-strike count on Conger before his second wild pitch in two innings allowed Wells to score the first run. Conger then grounded out.	In the third inning, Brandon Wood doubled and advanced to third on Izturis' second hit of the game, but Izturis was tagged out in a rundown. Kendrick then drove a 3-2 pitch over the left-center wall to put the Angels up 3-0.	The 391-foot shot was Kendrick's fifth homer of the season.	After allowing two hits to start the fourth, Floyd appeared to have found his rhythm, retiring eight in a row. But after a pair of two-out walks in the sixth, pitching coach Don Cooper paid Floyd a visit and Conger drove the next offering down the right-field line for his second homer of the season.	Conger is one of three catchers the Angels are carrying. Scioscia spoke at length before the game about the platoon and how he hoped someone would break away from the pack with offensive production.	"They were pounding me in. I was getting beat," Conger said. "After that mound visit I just wanted to hunt a fastball and put a swing on it."	Starting his third consecutive game, Conger finally broke through with the bat -- but he hasn't won the starting job yet.	"What's helping him is the way he's played defensively," said Scioscia, a former catcher. "If you're a catcher and you're not doing the job defensively, it doesn't matter how well you swing the bat."	Quentin led off the fifth by driving the first pitch he saw over the left-center fence for his 100th home run.	"It's a nice accomplishment," Quentin said. "Obviously, you want the win first."	Floyd was relieved in the seventh by Will Ohman, who gave up a double to Izturis and an RBI single to Kendrick that extended the Angels' lead to 7-1.	Konerko homered off Rich Thompson in the ninth.	Juan Pierre had two hits and reached base three times for the White Sox. He was caught stealing in the third, unsuccessful for the fifth straight time. He is 4-for-9 on stolen-base attempts this season.	Game notes	 The start was delayed for 2 hours, 10 minutes. ... Quentin has five hits in his past 32 at-bats. ... White Sox RHP Jake Peavy (right shoulder tendinitis) threw 34 pitches in a side session. He expects to throw 90-95 pitches Monday with Double-A Birmingham and will try to exceed 100 pitches next Saturday with Triple-A Charlotte. He hopes to rejoin the team by the end of April. ... The White Sox have committed the second-most errors in the majors this season, but Guillen has confidence his team will improve. "We have a third baseman [Brent Morel] who will win the Gold Glove before his career is over," Guillen said. "The shortstop [Alexei Ramirez] should be a Gold Glove [winner]." Angels 1B Kendrys Morales (left ankle) did some running drills at the team's spring training complex in Arizona on Friday and is "progressing," according to Scioscia.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Johnny Damon just keeps getting big hits.	Ben Zobrist led off the ninth with a tying home run and Damon ended the game with a two-out single, leading the Tampa Bay Rays to a 4-3 victory over the Minnesota Twins on Saturday.	Damon has the game-winning RBI in five consecutive games. The designated hitter has two walkoff hits -- including a two-run homer in the 10th inning of Thursday night's 4-3 win over Minnesota -- in the last three games.	"I'm starting to get that comfortability with my teammates right now," Damon said. "They're counting on me, so being able to have that comfortability is great. I wouldn't be in that situation if my teammates didn't help me get there."	Twins closer Joe Nathan (0-1) blew his second save of the series when Zobrist homered to tie the score at 3.	B.J. Upton walked and stole second. Nathan was replaced by Jose Mijares after walking Casey Kotchman and getting a flyball from John Jaso.	"I think everything, physically, how I feel, is fine," said Nathan, who didn't pitch last season after undergoing right elbow ligament replacement surgery. "I'm still going through that process. Trying to get this thing back to where I'd like it. But there's inconsistencies. There's outings I go out and it comes out of my hand pretty good. Then there's outings and it's not quite as good."	Mijares struck out pinch-hitter Elliot Johnson for the second out before walking Sam Fuld to load the bases. Damon then won it on his 2,583rd career hit -- which tied him with Ernie Banks for 80th place all-time.	Juan Cruz (1-0) worked a scoreless ninth for the Rays, who have won five in a row.	"We just do not quit," Rays manager Joe Maddon said. "We seem to pick up offensively as the game is in progress. I'll take the win any way we can get it. We keep grinding out at-bats, getting one more run."	Matt Capps gave up an RBI single in the eighth to Matt Joyce that cut the Tampa Bay deficit to 3-2. Minnesota has lost four straight and six of seven.	Nathan and Capps both had blown save opportunities Thursday night.	"We got the game into the right situation, in the right hands and it didn't work out," Minnesota manager Ron Gardenhire said. "We lost again today, late, and those things hurt worse sometimes the other ones."	Scott Baker, who held the Rays hitless in eight at-bats with runners in scoring position, allowed one run and four hits in seven innings. He kept Tampa Bay from scoring after Joyce opened the fourth with a double, and worked out of a two-on, no-out jam in fifth.	Baker struck out six and walked one. The right-hander retired his last nine batters.	"We could have, potentially, won all three games [of the series]," Baker said. "We play as a team. We win as a team. We lose as a team. We're just not getting it done right now. There's no panic button being pushed."	Jason Kubel put the Twins up 1-0 on a second-inning homer off Jeff Niemann. Kubel's shot was just the fourth home run hit by Minnesota this season.	Niemann gave up three runs and eight hits in seven innings. He was coming off a start last Sunday where he allowed five runs over 2 2/3 innings in a 6-1 loss to the Chicago White Sox.	Kubel had been hitless in nine previous at-bats against Niemann before his solo shot.	Minnesota took a 2-0 lead when Alexi Casilla scored during the third on Luke Hughes' double-play grounder.	Fuld pulled the Rays to 2-1 with a sacrifice fly later in the third.	Denard Span made it 3-1 with a fifth-inning RBI triple.	Game notes	 Minnesota 1B Justin Morneau was the DH. "Give him a little break," Gardenhire said. "I think he's doing really good." Morneau missed the final 78 games last season due to a concussion. ... Twins C Joe Mauer (viral infection) could take part in a light workout Sunday at the ballpark. ... Tampa Bay LHP J.P. Howell, who missed all of last season with a left shoulder injury, threw batting practice for the second time and could start a minor league rehab assignment in about a week.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

HOUSTON --  Pinch-hitter Joe Inglett got a tiebreaking hit. Carlos Lee made an inning-ending catch with runners on base. Nelson Figueroa bounced back from two rough starts.	Enough little things went Houston's way Saturday night and the Astros beat the San Diego Padres 5-3.	"Hopefully I can remember all the good things that happened," manager Brad Mills said. "It was a good night."	With the score tied at 3 in the seventh, Inglett was batting for reliever Mark Melancon. He hit the first pitch from Chad Qualls for an RBI single.	"I'll never get away from that," Inglett said. "That's probably the best pitch you're ever going to see, you don't want to get to the secondary [pitches]. I'm going to stay with that approach until the day I'm done doing this.	"It was a good day for the team as a whole."	Angel Sanchez also had a run-scoring single in the seventh.	Figueroa settled in after allowing two first inning runs. He went 6 2/3 innings with five strikeouts and two walks.	"I spoke all week about changing that mindset," Figueroa said. "Just bear down and make better pitches and utilize my defense a little more. I don't have to do it all myself. That was the game plan tonight."	Melancon (1-0) entered with runners on first and third and got Orlando Hudson to hit a low fly to left but Lee made a belly-flop catch to end the inning and keep the score tied at 3. Right fielder Hunter Pence made a diving catch in the ninth, too.	"That was key to the game," Black said. "Our club talks about that all the time, the importance of defense and how it related to run prevention. You saw two examples tonight late in the game of balls that were hit well that were turned into outs that could have changed the complexion of the game."	Brandon Lyon got his third save in four chances.	Mat Latos (0-2) pitched 6 1/3 innings for the Padres but after striking out Brett Wallace to start the seventh, he walked the next two batters to set up Inglett's go-ahead hit.	Latos had not allowed a run against the Astros in 16 1/3 innings.	"I felt really good," Latos said. "I hit my spots for the most part, but I started to leave my ball up. Later in the game, I don't know if I was tired or what, but I just wasn't feeling it."	Chase Headley came close to having two homers. He settled for two long doubles in helping the Padres build a 3-1 lead after four innings.	Figueroa allowed two runs in the first inning. Will Venable reached on second baseman Matt Downs' fielding error and Hudson walked before Headley stroked a long double to the top of the hill in center field.	Headley also doubled to the left field wall in the fourth and scored on Brad Hawpe's single to left field for a 3-1 lead.	Chris Johnson tied it for Houston in the bottom half with his first homer of the year. Lee singled ahead of the home run.	Latos has allowed three homers in two starts this season.	The Astros got one run in the first. Centerfielder Michael Bourn reached on an infield hit, stole his seventh base this season, and scored on Pence's double between the gap in right-center.	Game notes	 Padres outfielder Kyle Blanks is continuing his rehab assignment as a DH with Double-A San Antonio. He went 3 for 6 and scored four runs in Friday's game. Hudson went 0 for 3, ending his 11-game hitting streak. The Padres are eight games into a 20-game stretch without a day off; they won't get a day off until April 28.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ATLANTA --  Jair Jurrjens returned from the disabled list and handcuffed the New York Mets, leaving them with their longest losing streak in seven years.	Jurrjens threw seven sharp innings, combining with George Sherrill and Scott Linebrink on a two-hitter, and the Braves shut out the struggling Mets 4-0 Saturday night to complete a doubleheader sweep.	In the opener, Alex Gonzalez hit two of Atlanta's four solo homers and the Braves finally provided some offense for Derek Lowe in a 4-2 victory.	The Mets were swept in a doubleheader for the second time in three days to extend their losing streak to seven games, their longest since dropping 11 straight in 2004. Colorado swept the Mets in New York on Thursday.	Jurrjens was better than expected in his return from a right oblique strain.	"Having him back was huge for our team," said Eric Hinske, who had three hits in his second start this season at first base. "For your first game coming off the DL, that's way more than you could ask for."	Jurrjens finished the 2010 season on the disabled list with a knee injury before sustaining the oblique strain late in spring training. He was one of Atlanta's top starters in 2008 and 2009, when he went a combined 27-20.	"It's a good feeling being able to help your team," Jurrjens said. "It's exciting being back out there. It's fun, and I hope it continues the rest of the season."	Jurrjens (1-0) faced the minimum 15 batters through five innings. He gave up two hits with one walk and seven strikeouts.	The Mets (4-11) have matched the third-worst start in franchise history, according to STATS LLC. They opened 3-12 in 1962 and 1964. They also lost 11 of their first 15 games in 1974 and 1981.	New York has lost 10 of 11 after winning three of its first four games under new manager Terry Collins.	"They care. They're unhappy," Collins said. "We're going to get ready for tomorrow."	Mike Pelfrey (0-2) allowed 11 hits and four runs in five-plus innings. He gave up three hits in the first, including a run-scoring single by Dan Uggla, and three more in the third, including Chipper Jones' RBI single.	Hinske drove in a run and Martin Prado had two hits and scored two runs in the second game. Jones, who hit a homer in the opener, added two hits.	Willie Harris singled with two outs in the second but was picked off to end the inning. Jurrjens then retired the next nine batters before Daniel Murphy led off the sixth with a double. Murphy was thrown out by catcher David Ross on an ill-advised attempt to steal third.	"We used to call that an error of enthusiasm," Collins said. "I addressed it."	Murphy accepted the blame for his mental mistake.	"It was an awful play," he said. "There was nothing that could have been going through my mind that would have justified that. I'm not going to score three runs by myself. I killed [the inning]."	The only other baserunner allowed by Jurrjens was a walk to Mike Nickeas in the sixth.	The four homers in the opener, including one by rookie Freddie Freeman, were a season high for Atlanta and the most for the team since hitting four in a 16-5 win over the Chicago Cubs on Aug. 22, 2010.	Lowe (2-2) gave up two runs and five hits in six innings. He has a 1.82 ERA this season, but lost his previous two starts as the Braves were shut out by Milwaukee and Philadelphia.	D.J. Carrasco (0-1) yielded four hits, including three homers, in 3 2/3 innings as a fill-in starter for New York in the first game.	Before the opener, the Mets placed right-hander Chris Young on the 15-day disabled list with biceps tendinitis in his pitching arm. Right-hander Dillon Gee will be recalled from Triple-A Buffalo to start on Sunday.	Craig Kimbrel worked the ninth to earn his fourth save.	The series opener was postponed by rain Friday night. The Mets were playing consecutive doubleheaders for the first time since Aug. 20-21, 1998, against St. Louis. Club officials called the commissioner's office Friday night, hoping to avoid a second straight twin bill, but the makeup game remained.	Players wore No. 42 jerseys in the opener as part of baseball's annual tribute to Jackie Robinson, originally planned for Friday night. Among those wearing No. 42 was Harris who, like Robinson, was born in Cairo, Ga.	Harris drove in Carlos Beltran with a double off Lowe in the sixth, cutting it to 3-2. Josh Thole had a single and scored on Jose Reyes' grounder in the fifth.	The Braves began the day with 11 homers in 13 games.	Gonzalez has 16 of his 140 career homers against the Mets, more than any other team.	Jones, whose history of success against the Mets is no secret, began the day with a .319 career batting average against New York. The homer was his 45th against the Mets, matching his total against the Phillies.	Game notes	 LHP Pat Misch, just recalled from Triple-A Buffalo, will be dropped from the roster to make room for Gee, Collins said. ... After the first game, the Braves placed right-hander Peter Moylan on the 15-day disabled list with a lower back strain, clearing a roster spot for Jurrjens. ... Mets LF Jason Bay, on the DL with a strained left rib cage, was to play a rehab game for Class-A St. Lucie on Saturday night and could join the team Tuesday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DENVER --  Casey Coleman handled both the altitude and his bat well in his first start at Coors Field.	Coleman scattered four hits while working into the sixth inning and singled in the go-ahead run in the Chicago Cubs' 8-3 win at Colorado on Saturday night that snapped the Rockies' seven-game winning streak.	Starlin Castro led Chicago's 17-hit outburst by going 4 for 5 with a three-run homer and Alfonso Soriano also went deep for the Cubs, who ended a six-game skid at Coors Field that dated to Aug. 9, 2009.	The Cubs broke a 1-all tie in the fifth after Coleman slapped a one-out single to center off Jason Hammel and went to third on Castro's double down the left-field line. Coleman scored on Darwin Barney's slow roller to first baseman Jason Giambi.	"He threw me a really good curveball in my first at-bat and then he threw one that I don't think was as good as the first one," Coleman said.	Hammel said that one hanging curve bothered him the most.	"I hate giving up hits to pitchers," he said. "But you know, from what we had done scouting-wise, I guess he's a pretty decent hitter. But a hanging curveball? I was trying to punch him out and he sat back on it and hit it real well. So, kudos to him."	Despite walking three and hitting two batters with pitches, Coleman (1-0) kept the Rockies off balance while giving up just one run, which came in the second when Troy Tulowitzki tripled and scored on a sacrifice fly that tied the game at 1.	"I can see how it's tough" pitching at Coors Field, Coleman said following his 10th major league start. "You get the rubbed-up balls, you throw one pitch and they're slick again. You have to make adjustments, but it's good to make it out of here alive."	If banged up.	Coleman took a line drive off his right foot in the sixth and came out of the game, although the Cubs said he was fine. He had the foot wrapped in ice and an Ace bandage afterward.	"They're just doing it for precaution to keep the swelling down if there is anything," Coleman said. "I could have stayed in the game. It was just the right matchup with [Todd] Helton pinch-hitting."	The Rockies, who were missing Carlos Gonzalez (soreness) and Helton (rest) from their starting lineup, hadn't been blown out all year, losing just twice in their first 13 games, both in extra innings.	Hammel (1-1) became the first Rockies starter to lose all season, allowing three runs and seven hits over six innings.	So efficient while jumping out to a baseball-best 11-2 start, the Rockies' watered-down lineup was 0 for 12 with runners in scoring position, including 0 for 9 against Coleman. Colorado left 13 men on base.	"That's not a very good formula for success," manager Jim Tracy lamented. "But we kept playing. We were a hitter away in the bottom of the eighth inning from really making it interesting, even at 8-3."	Soriano made it 3-1 in the sixth with his fifth homer, which came off Hammel.	The Cubs put it away with a five-run seventh, with all the runs coming off righty Felipe Paulino, who allowed hits to five of the six batters he faced and was charged with five earned runs. He saw his ERA jump from 1.59 to 9.00.	Castro's blow was the big one. He sent an 0-1 offering into the left-field stands for his first homer, which made it 6-1.	"Obviously, that guy was a complete nemesis tonight, period," Tracy said.	Before Castro's big blow, Blake DeWitt hit a single past Giambi after Koyie Hill's bunt hit. Had the smooth-fielding Helton, who pinch-hit in the sixth, stayed in the game, he might have started an inning-ending double play on DeWitt's grounder and limited the damage.	Tracy said he never considered keeping Helton in the game, however.	"No. No. Because if I was going to use him, it was going to be in a situation like that to pinch-hit, but not to put him out there and play him knowing I'm coming back and am going to play him tomorrow. Don't want to grind on him like that, no way," Tracy said.	Chris Iannetta homered for Colorado, his two-run shot off John Grabow in the eighth making it 8-3. The Rockies had a chance to make it interesting, putting two on for Giambi, who battled Kerry Wood through a 10-pitch at-bat before striking out.	Soriano's RBI double put the Cubs ahead 1-0 in the second, and the Rockies tied it in the bottom half on Seth Smith's sacrifice fly that scored Tulowitzki, but Colorado wasted leadoff doubles in the fifth and sixth while the game was still up for grabs.	"We'll file this one away and start over tomorrow and try to win a series," Tracy said. "It's one of those things, this is going to happen once in a while. And as long as it only happens once in a while, we'll be in a very good place."	Game notes	 RHP Alan Johnson will make his major league debut Sunday when the Rockies wrap up their three-game series with the Cubs. Johnson, 27, has spent six-plus seasons in the minor leagues, going 56-42 with a 4.55 ERA. ... Tracy said Gonzalez was dealing with "stiffness and soreness" related to the flu he played through in New York and it was affecting his offense. Tracy said he wanted to rest Tulowitzki on Sunday, but Tulowitzki talked him out of it.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

PHOENIX --  Someone, it seemed, always picked up the slack and provided what was needed for the San Francisco Giants during their World Series run last year. The same thing is happening now.	Barry Zito went down in the second inning with a sprained right foot Saturday night but Guillermo Mota came on for 4 1/3 innings of solid relief, his longest stint in 672 major league appearances over 13 seasons, and the Giants won their fourth straight, 5-3 over the Arizona Diamondbacks.	"It's tough for Barry. I don't know what happened or the severity of it, but hats off to Guillermo Mota," teammate Mark DeRosa said. "Player of the game, no doubt."	Zito was on crutches, the middle of his right foot noticeably swollen, as he contemplated the possibility that he might miss a start due to injury, something that's never happened to him in his major league career. He came back from a car accident on the eve of opening day to make his regularly scheduled first start.	"Yeah," he said when asked if the streak crossed his mind. "When I feel my foot, it's pretty painful. I couldn't throw my [practice] pitch too well, but there are incredible things that can happen.	"I was able to recover from that accident and that was huge, so we'll see. We'll see what the MRI says tomorrow and just go out and take it day by day."	Freddy Sanchez doubled in the tying run in the sixth inning, then put San Francisco up for good with a two-run single in the seventh.	"The depth of this team was something that was a positive for us last year and I think this year it's the same," DeRosa said.	Mota (1-0) allowed one run and three hits, striking out four with no walks.	"He knew coming into spring training that would be a role for him if he was on this club," manager Bruce Bochy said. "He worked hard, stretching his workload out, multiple innings. Talking to him at the end of spring training he said that he knew that this would be his role, and he's a pro. To his credit, he got himself ready to handle a situation like this."	The Diamondbacks tied a franchise record by converting five double plays to erase a big share of San Francisco's 13 hits.	Buster Posey hit a two-run homer in the first inning off Joe Saunders (0-3), who gave up five runs on 12 hits in 6 2/3 innings.	Brian Wilson pitched a perfect ninth to give him a save in each of the Giants' four straight wins. The reigning World Series champions have won seven of nine after opening the season 1-4.	Sanchez's RBI double tied it at 3. Singles by Pat Burrell and Mark DeRosa and a walk to Aaron Rowand loaded the bases with two outs in the seventh, ending Saunders' day.	Sam Demel relieved the Arizona starter and Sanchez's soft single between third and shortstop brought in two runs to put the Giants back ahead, 5-3. The Diamondbacks lost their third straight and fell to 3-5 on a nine-game homestand that ends with the series finale against San Francisco on Sunday.	"We didn't match their bullpen," Arizona manager Kirk Gibson said. "They got 7 1/3 innings from their 'pen. The way I had my lineup set up with all the righties in there and Zito goes out after 1 2-3. Their bullpen responded as good as you can ask, giving up one run. When it rains it pours. Right now we have to fight through it."	Arizona scored two off Zito in the second on doubles by Chris Young and Miguel Montero, sandwiched around a four-pitch walk to Xavier Nady. That brought up Saunders, who bunted toward the mound. Zito appeared to catch his right spike in the turf as he lunged to make the catch.	After he was unable to continue, Mota came on to get Willie Bloomquist to bounce out to end the inning.	Arizona took a 3-2 lead on Melvin Mora's RBI double, with the 39-year-old Diamondback tagged out by several feet trying for third on the play.	Posey's second home run of the season came with two outs on a 1-2 pitch, the ball making it to the seats in left-center, to the left of a 413-foot sign.	Game notes	 Bloomquist went 0 for 4, ending a 10-game hitting streak that was tied for a franchise best to start a season. ... Montero has reached base in all 12 games, 10 of them on hits. ... The Giants have homered in the first inning in both games to start the Arizona series. Pablo Sandoval had a three-run shot in the 5-2 victory Friday night. ... Bochy turned 56 on Saturday. ... The five Diamondbacks double plays came in the first six innings.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  Dallas Braden helped pitch the Athletics to their second home win of the season, but it might have come at a price.	Braden combined with four relievers on a six-hitter but had to leave early in Oakland's 6-2 victory over the Detroit Tiger on Saturday night after complaining of tightness in his left shoulder.	A's manager Bob Geren said Braden, who threw a perfect game on Mother's Day in 2010, would undergo further evaluation. The pitcher was terse when asked about his health afterward.	"Shoulder stiff," Braden responded coldly before repeating himself. "Shoulder was stiff. I couldn't continue. Show up tomorrow, we'll evaluate then."	Braden's health was the only dark lining on an otherwise solid day for the A's, who dropped the first two games on this homestand before knocking around Detroit ace Justin Verlander.	David DeJesus and Hideki Matsui had two hits apiece as Oakland smacked six doubles, five against Verlander (1-2).	The A's also overcame their major league-leading 17th error to win for the second time in six games at the Coliseum this season. They ended Detroit's four-game winning streak.	"Our pitching staff's been doing their thing all year so we have to start scoring some runs for them," Oakland shortstop Cliff Pennington said. "You always want to win at home. Now we have to try to go out here tomorrow and try to split this series."	Braden wasn't as crisp as he has been this season and had to pitch out of jams in the second and fourth.	Coming off six sharp innings against the Chicago White Sox on Monday, Braden (1-1) struck out five and walked two. He left after five innings and only 67 pitches when his shoulder tightened up.	"He was throwing the ball well that inning, then started going to his changeup a lot more," Geren said. "That gave you the indication that maybe he didn't want to use his fastball for one reason or the other."	Braden said he knew he couldn't continue after the fifth. That put the game in the hands of Oakland's bullpen, which had come under scrutiny after failing to support strong outings by starters Gio Gonzalez and Brandon McCarthy in the first two games of this four-game series.	This time, the relievers didn't give in.	Brad Ziegler, Craig Breslow, Grant Balfour and Brian Fuentes pitched one inning apiece to complete the six-hitter.	Oakland needed the strong outing to help overcome a throwing error by first baseman Daric Barton that gave the Tigers a 1-0 lead.	It was the A's eighth error in their past five games. Fortunately for Oakland, the offense got to Verlander in the fourth.	DeJesus, Josh Willingham and Matsui hit consecutive doubles to open the inning and give the A's a 2-1 lead. Kurt Suzuki followed with a single and when left fielder Ryan Raburn bobbled the ball for an error, Matsui raced around third to score.	The game took a quirky turn in the bottom of the fifth.	Verlander walked Barton, then was on the mound when he suddenly jumped off the rubber and fired toward the plate. The ball hit DeJesus in the foot and he was initially awarded first base while Barton moved to second.	Detroit manager Jim Leyland came out to question the call, and after the four umpires conferred, the play was ruled a balk. DeJesus was sent back to the box and Barton remained at second.	Verlander explained that he was trying to make a pickoff throw to first base but his body was caught out of position, so he thought if he just threw home he could avoid a balk.	"I saw the video of it and I couldn't help but laugh at myself," Verlander said. "It might be the first time it happened in general. I thought nothing could happen at the plate. It was funny talking to the umpires. They gave me a hard time about it, too."	Verlander got out of the jam but was gone an inning later after an RBI double by Coco Crisp. The right-hander allowed eight hits and four runs -- three earned -- in six innings, finishing with six strikeouts.	Oakland scored a pair of insurance runs in the eighth off reliever Enrique Gonzalez. Detroit then loaded the bases in the ninth and scored one run before Fuentes retired the final two batters.	Designated hitter Magglio Ordonez went 1 for 4 in his return to Detroit's lineup. He had been out since Monday with a tight Achilles' in his right foot.	Game notes	 The Tigers have doubled in all 15 games this year, the franchise's longest streak to start a season since at least 1919. ... Verlander needs eight strikeouts to reach 1,000 for his career. ... Leyland said he plans to give 3B Brandon Inge the day off Sunday. ... The seven runs scored by Detroit in the 10th inning Friday were the most the Tigers have scored in extra innings since 1991. ... Barton's error was his fifth this year. The first baseman had 10 total in 2010. ... Oakland had not hit three consecutive doubles in one inning since Sept. 5, 2009, against Seattle. ... A's RHP Michael Wuertz got knocked around during a rehab assignment with Class-A Stockton. Wuertz, on the disabled list with a hamstring strain, started and gave up three runs and four hits in one inning.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

LOS ANGELES --  The St. Louis Cardinals kept rolling at the plate, hitting a home run for the eighth straight game. And this time, the slugger's name wasn't Pujols, Holliday or Berkman.	Allen Craig, starting in place of Lance Berkman, who got the night off, hit a three-run shot in the fifth inning and the Cardinals routed the slumping Los Angeles Dodgers 9-2 Saturday night to win their fourth in a row and sixth in seven games.	"I didn't go out there looking to have a big night. Just tried to pitch in and make something happen," Craig said. "Last year was a big learning experience for me coming off the bench and not playing a lot. It's not easy coming off the bench, but I'm more prepared for it."	It was the seventh straight game that the Cardinals scored six or more runs and the first time in six games that they didn't put up at least 14 hits. They had 13, including five straight in the ninth off Ramon Troncoso, to win their third in a row over Los Angeles.	"We're going to take consistent at-bats," said Cardinals manager Tony La Russa, who is fighting a severe right eye infection. "Our approach is very competitive and sometimes it makes a difference."	Kyle McClellan (2-0) allowed one run and six hits in seven innings, struck out two and walked none to earn his second major league victory as a starter in six days.	"I felt good, the best I've felt yet this year -- including spring training," he said. "I just felt at any time I could throw a strike whenever I wanted."	The Dodgers started ace Clayton Kershaw (2-2), but he got into bases-loaded jams in the second and third while laboring through 4 2/3 innings, his shortest outing this season. The left-hander gave up five runs and six hits, struck out a season-low five and walked a season-high five while throwing 111 pitches.	"I walked too many guys and threw away too many pitches. I tried to battle my way through it, but the home run did us in," Kershaw said. "When you're throwing tons of pitches and battling, you've really got to keep your team in the game. But after that home run, a 5-1 lead is pretty tough to come back from, especially when they're playing the way they are right now."	The offense didn't provide him much support. Juan Uribe was hitless in four at-bats as the Dodgers lost their fifth in a row and sixth in seven games.	"We've got to keep turning the page. We've got to get some momentum on our side and start putting some wins together," Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said. "I have confidence in what we're capable of doing."	Craig provided the Cardinals' power a night after Albert Pujols and Berkman each homered in consecutive at-bats. Pujols managed two singles in five at-bats and struck out twice, while Matt Holliday went 1-for-3 with two walks and an RBI.	"That's how the game goes," Craig said. "We lost some close games early on that we probably could have won. It's not to say we're going to score 10 runs every game."	Kershaw got out of his first bases-loaded jam in the second by striking out the final two batters. In the third, however, he walked Holliday to load the bases again and David Freese's sacrifice fly scored the Cardinals' first run.	They took a 2-0 lead in the third on Ryan Theriot's RBI double to deep left.	The Dodgers cut their deficit to 2-1 in the fourth. Andre Ethier, who went 3-for-4, singled to extend his major league-leading hitting streak to 13 games. He scored on James Loney's grounder to first, as catcher Gerald Laird went up the third-base line to take Pujols' throw and missed the sweep tag.	In the fifth, Pujols singled and Holliday walked before Craig's first homer of the season chased Kershaw and made it 5-1. It was the first homer Kershaw has allowed to any current St. Louis hitter.	Game notes	 The Dodgers recalled Troncoso from Triple-A Albuquerque and placed LHP Hong-Chih Kuo on the 15-day disabled list with a left lower back strain, retroactive to April 14. "The good thing is it's not an elbow or shoulder. We feel it's muscular," Mattingly said, adding that Kuo wouldn't throw for a couple of days while undergoing tests. ... Thirteen of Craig's 24 career RBIs have come with two outs. ... Dodgers pinch hitter Ivan De Jesus Jr. singled in the seventh for his first major league hit. ... The Cardinals won their 1,000th game all-time against the Dodgers on Friday night. ... IndyCar driver Marco Andretti, in town for Sunday's Long Beach Grand Prix, threw out the first pitch, sailing the ball over the head of former Dodgers manager Tom Lasorda, acting as catcher. Andretti got a second chance and Lasorda caught it with Andretti's grandfather, Mario, looking on. ... Dodgers GM Ned Colletti turned 56.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CLEVELAND --  Grady Sizemore never heard the crowd's roar.	Striding to the plate for his first at-bat in 11 months on a surgically repaired left knee, Sizemore's mind raced. His thoughts drowned out a welcoming ovation from fans who couldn't wait to see him back in Cleveland's leadoff spot and roaming center field.	As he stepped into the box, the noisy ballpark went silent.	"There was a lot going on right there," he said.	The grueling rehab. The hours of practice. The wait.	All of it was over.	Sizemore homered and doubled in his first game back after major knee surgery last year, and the off-and-running Indians beat the Baltimore Orioles 4-2 on Sunday to complete a three-game series sweep. Baltimore has lost seven straight.	Cleveland's hustling All-Star center fielder and leadoff man, Sizemore hadn't played since last May, when he was forced to have microfracture surgery on his left knee. Finally healthy, he homered in his second at-bat off Brad Bergesen (0-2) and doubled in the fifth.	"I just wanted to go up there, have good at-bats, help the team and get a win," Sizemore said. "I was definitely nervous."	It hardly showed.	Carlos Santana and Travis Hafner also homered for the first-place Indians, who have won seven in a row at home and 11 of 13. Fausto Carmona (1-2) worked seven strong innings, allowing one earned run and five hits. Chris Perez pitched a 1-2-3 ninth for his fifth save.	Brian Roberts went 3 for 4 for the Orioles, who have lost eight of 10, effectively erasing their 4-0 start. Baltimore has scored just 17 runs in its slide.	"We didn't think scoring runs would be an issues with this team but it is," said first baseman Derrek Lee, who grounded into a double play to damage a potentially big inning in the fourth. "We need to put up better quality at-bats."	This was the day Sizemore had been building toward for months. He hoped to be back in time for opening day, but wasn't quite ready when the Indians broke training camp. He started the season on the disabled list and playing in the minors to build strength and confidence.	"I've been looking forward to this for a long time," Sizemore said before the game. "It's finally here."	He got a standing ovation when he came up in the first by Cleveland fans, many of whom have been diligently tracking the popular player's progress for months. Sizemore grounded out to second, but he busted down the first-base line like always before being thrown out.	In the third, Sizemore didn't have to run as hard.	He drove a 2-0 pitch from Bergesen over the wall in right for his first homer since Aug. 27, 2009, at Baltimore, giving the Indians a 2-0 lead. Sizemore doubled into the right-field corner in the fifth, coasting into second base without having to slide.	"Today is the first day I've seen him totally healthy since I've been here," said Perez, who joined the Indians midway through 2009. "He put on a great show. It's only one game, but he looked good. It's a tremendous uplift to have a guy like him back with us."	Off to a surprising 11-4 start, the Indians have gotten to first place in the AL Central despite their ace, Carmona, winning just one time in three starts, with Shin-Soo Choo and Santana yet to break out, and with Sizemore only in the lineup once.	"Numbers are not everything," Indians manager Manny Acta said. "That's what it's all about, make sure you have more than two or three heroes for the whole all year."	Sizemore only had to field one fly ball in tricky winds that gusted all afternoon through Progressive Field, making everything hit in the air an adventure. He hopes to be back in the lineup on Monday, when the Indians open a three-game series in Kansas City.	Hafner hit his fourth homer with one out in the sixth, giving Cleveland a 4-1 lead. Hafner didn't connect for his fourth homer last season until May 22, in Cleveland's 41st game.	The Orioles had runners at the corners with one out in the seventh but scored just once. After getting Luke Scott to line to left for a sacrifice fly, Carmona retired the next two batters on ground balls to short.	Baltimore also blew a chance to have a big inning in the fourth. The Orioles put two on with none out and had the meat of their order coming up, but Carmona got Lee to bounce into a double play and struck out Vladimir Guerrero.	Santana snapped an 0-for-23 slump with his leadoff homer in the second. The switch-hitting catcher, who was given a day off Friday, drove a 3-2 pitch from Bergesen over the wall in right-center for his second homer and first since opening day.	Game notes	 Baltimore's starters have a 8.45 ERA during the losing streak. The Orioles' staff has given up 48 earned runs in the last seven games after allowing only 14 in the first seven. ... Orioles RHP Koji Uehara walked Choo in the eighth, the first walk he'd given up in 36 appearances. It's the third-longest streak in history. Hall of Famer Dennis Eckersley went 41 games and John Smoltz 38. ... Cleveland starters have not allowed a run in the first inning of the past 13 games, and opponents are hitting just .095 (4 for 42) in their first at-bat. ... The Indians placed starter Mitch Talbot on the 15-day DL with a strained elbow. Acta said Talbot could be out "a little longer" than two weeks.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CINCINNATI --  Andrew McCutchen hit the game's third pitch over the wall in right field, a drive pushed by the same wind that would fling garbage bags, paper wrappers and hanging fastballs everywhere all afternoon long.	Not much fun, not even for the winning Pirates.	McCutchen opened with a homer against slow-starting Edinson Volquez, then singled home the tiebreaking run in the eighth inning Sunday, rallying Pittsburgh to a 7-6 win over the Cincinnati Reds in a game as hard to pin down as all that garbage flying through the air.	"It definitely gave me some gray hairs," said McCutchen, who had three hits and a pair of walks.	No one ever got comfortable in this one.	McCutchen and Jose Tabata started it with back-to-back homers -- only the third time that's happened in Pirates history. McCutchen singled off Logan Ondrusek (2-1) for the go-ahead run, which barely held up.	Closer Joel Hanrahan came on with two aboard in the eighth and got Scott Rolen to line into a double play, started by shortstop Ronny Cedeno's diving catch. The Reds then loaded the bases with two outs in the ninth, but Hanrahan got Drew Stubbs to fly out, securing his fifth save in five chances.	"That might have been the most interesting five outs I've ever been part of on the field," Hanrahan said.	Chris Resop (1-0) escaped yet another Reds threat in the seventh, helping the Pirates win for only the second time in their last seven games.	The defending NL Central champions came away with a mystifying problem at the top of their rotation: Volquez just can't seem to get started. In his four games this season, the former All-Star has an ERA of 29.25 in the opening inning. It's 1.93 the rest of the way.	Volquez got an extra day of rest for the game because of a stiff neck, and thought that was a factor in his slow start.	"A little," he said. "I was afraid to throw my fastball in the first inning. After that, I just let it go."	McCutchen homered to right on his third pitch of the game, the outfielder's seventh leadoff homer. The crowd of 32,105 was still murmuring when Tabata homered on the next pitch as well, earning a place in Pirates history.	The only other Pirate duos to lead off a game with homers: Pete Coscarart and Jim Russell against Boston in 1945, and Omar Moreno and Johnny Ray against Houston in 1982.	It was a satisfying game all-around for McCutchen, who came in batting .204.	"It was just a matter of time, that's all," said McCutchen, who raised his average to .250. "All I could do was laugh about it because I knew that's not me. Now it's starting to turn around."	Volquez threw hard -- his fastball hit 96 mph -- but had poor control. After the homers, he walked Lyle Overbay on four pitches. Neil Walker doubled off the wall in center, and Volquez walked Garrett Jones and Chris Snyder to force in a run. Cedeno hit a sacrifice fly to warning track in center for a 4-0 lead.	On opening day, Volquez also opened the game by giving up back-to-back homers to Milwaukee's Rickie Weeks and Carlos Gomez. The Reds rallied in the ninth for a 7-6 win.	This time, they came up one hit short.	Jonny Gomes led off the second with a solo shot off Jeff Karstens, his third homer in his last five at-bats. Miguel Cairo also had a solo shot off Karstens, who made his first start of the season. Jay Bruce had an RBI single and a solo homer that tied it 6-all in the seventh inning.	McCutchen put the Pirates ahead to stay with his third hit of the game. He also walked twice in five plate appearances.	Game notes	 Karstens lasted 4 1/3 innings, giving up eight hits and five runs. He matched his career high with six strikeouts. ... It was Ondrusek's first career loss. He'd won his first seven decisions. ... In first innings this season, Volquez has thrown 30, 44, 21 and 33 pitches. ... The last pitcher to give up back-to-back opening homers twice in a season? Kansas City's Chad Durbin in 2000, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. ... RH Homer Bailey made his first rehab start at Triple-A Louisville and threw 62 pitches in five scoreless innings, allowing two hits. ... 2B Brandon Phillips was out of the lineup for the third straight game with a sore groin. He took infield practice.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

BOSTON --  The Boston Red Sox are now starting to feel like a winning team again.	Jacoby Ellsbury hit a three-run homer, Jarrod Saltalamacchia drove in three runs and Jon Lester pitched six solid innings in an 8-1 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays on Sunday.	The win gave Boston consecutive victories for the first time this season. The Red Sox, trendy preseason picks to go to the World Series, began the day 3-10, the worst record in the major leagues. They can win the series against Toronto when Daisuke Matsuzaka faces Ricky Romero in the traditional Patriots Day game Monday.	"That's great. Tomorrow will be a winning streak," Boston first baseman Adrian Gonzalez said, breaking into a slight smile. "If we can win tomorrow, we'll get a roll going into the road trip."	Boston opened the year 0-6 -- all on the road -- before coming home April 8 and taking two of three last weekend from the Yankees. They close out a rain-shortened nine-game homestand Monday before heading away for nine games.	"Once it starts to go all together, it'll be scary," Saltalamacchia said. "A couple of good days isn't good enough. We've got to put it all together."	Lester (1-1) gave up one run, six hits and three walks while striking out five. He was pulled with two on and no out in the seventh after an error by shortstop Jed Lowrie. Daniel Bard relieved and Juan Rivera lined into a double play before Yunel Escobar struck out.	Bobby Jenks struck out J.P. Arencibia to end the eighth with two runners on base, and Dan Wheeler got the final three outs to secure the win.	Arencibia had two hits for the Blue Jays, who have lost seven of their last 10.	Boston trailed 1-0 before getting four straight hits off Jesse Litsch (1-1) in the second inning. Saltalamacchia's RBI single trickled through the second-base hole to tie it after Lowrie and J.D. Drew singled. Ellsbury then belted his homer to right field, a drive that twisted around the Pesky Pole for his team-leading third of the season.	"That was big," Gonzalez said. "To be able to get a three-run cushion there."	Asked if his team looked more relaxed at the plate and was having better at-bats, Boston manager Terry Francona said: "Once you win games, it's easy to say."	Litsch, making his third start since shoulder surgery last August, allowed six runs -- four earned -- on eight hits, while striking out five and walking one in six innings.	"The six runs is not what you want to see on the board. If I can take back that home run, I definitely would," Litsch said. "It was going to be a fastball inside. I fell behind 2-0 and I threw it down the middle and he got me."	Saltalamacchia, who entered the day hitting just .138 with two RBIs, added a two-run single in the sixth to make it 6-1. That was more than enough for Lester.	The Red Sox added two runs in the eighth off Shawn Camp.	The Blue Jays, relying on stolen bases at a higher rate this season, used some clever baserunning to grab a 1-0 lead in the second. With Rivera on first, Aaron Hill on third and two outs, Rivera broke for second. Saltalamacchia threw to second, Rivera stopped and Hill raced home before Rivera was tagged out after a rundown.	"Lester was his usual self, tough to really generate multiple baserunners or a chance to really tack on any runs after the steal attempt in the second inning," Toronto manager John Farrell said. Farrell should know, having served as Red Sox pitching coach from 2007 to last season while the left-hander matured into an ace starter.	Carl Crawford, given the day off Saturday to help him relax during his tough start with the Red Sox, was back in the lineup and leading off Sunday. He didn't hit the ball out of the infield, going 0 for 4 to drop his average to .127.	The left fielder signed a seven-year, $142-millon contract during the offseason.	Game notes	 Toronto swiped two bases to raise its total to 21. ... Lester had to scurry off the mound as the jagged edge of Escobar's broken bat came bouncing at him in the fourth. ... Lowrie was back in the lineup, batting sixth and playing shortstop after hitting leadoff with a two-run homer in Saturday's win. "Jed's so hot right now, I don't know how you can keep a guy like that out," Francona said. He went 1 for 4 with an RBI on his 27th birthday. ... Toronto's Corey Patterson had gone 0 for 7 in the series -- three on diving plays on grounders by Gonzalez on Saturday -- before a double in the third. He entered the weekend 7 for 17 after coming off the DL on April 11. ... Monday's game starts at 11:05 a.m.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ATLANTA --  Travel-weary Dillon Gee used borrowed spikes, a borrowed glove and Josh Thole's hitting in a new-look lineup to help the New York Mets end their longest losing streak in seven years.	Thole, hitting second for the first time this season, had two run-scoring singles, Gee came up from the minors to earn the win and the Mets beat the Atlanta Braves 3-2 on Sunday to end their seven-game losing streak.	Gee, promoted from Triple-A Buffalo, said he had travel delays in Providence, R.I., and Philadelphia before finally arriving in Atlanta about 1 a.m. on Sunday.	"Yesterday was a long day," Gee said. "I was stuck in the airport all day."	His baggage never arrived, so he had to borrow Thole's shoes and Bobby Parnell's glove.	"It's the same game out there, no matter what glove you've got," Gee said.	Gee left Turner Field in a shirt and tie borrowed from another teammate, Mike Nickeas.	He also left with a win and a guarantee of at least one more start in New York's rotation after ending the Mets' longest skid since 11 straight losses in 2004.	"It's our biggest win so far, I can tell you that," manager Terry Collins said. "The key today was Dillon Gee getting us innings."	Collins used his roster as if managing a postseason game. Starting pitchers Chris Capuano and R.A. Dickey threw in relief behind Gee.	"It's both their days to throw anyway," Collins said. "They were going to throw [in the bullpen] anyway."	Gee (1-0) gave up five hits and a run in 5 2/3 innings to beat Tommy Hanson (1-3).	"He kept us off balance most of the game," Braves catcher Brian McCann said.	Collins shook up the lineup, moving Thole, the Mets' catcher, up from the No. 8 spot to hit behind leadoff hitter Jose Reyes. Thole had run-scoring singles in the first and fifth innings.	"Believe me, we haven't played up to our capabilities, but we're a good team," Collins said.	More help could come soon. Collins will meet with outfielder Jason Bay on Monday, and Bay could come off the disabled list Tuesday in New York against Houston.	"I hope he's ready to play," Collins said. "I hope he's ready to hit, but to get him back and get him in our lineup means a lot to us."	Bay, on the disabled list with a rib cage injury, was 0 for 3 while playing seven innings in his second injury rehab game with Class-A St. Lucie on Sunday. He was 1 for 2 on Saturday night with an intentional walk.	Atlanta's Jason Heyward hit a homer off Jason Isringhausen in the eighth.	Francisco Rodriguez pitched the ninth for his second save. Chipper Jones walked to lead off the ninth and was stranded on third when Rodriguez struck out pinch-hitter Brooks Conrad.	The Mets bounced back after being swept in doubleheaders by the Braves on Saturday and by Colorado on Thursday.	Ike Davis drove in Thole with a single in the first inning.	Thole hit eighth in each of his previous 11 starts.	The Mets needed Gee after placing right-hander Chris Young on the 15-day disabled list Saturday with right biceps tendinitis. Young will miss at least one more start, so Collins said Gee will have another start this week.	Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez also altered his lineup. Heyward hit second, McCann hit third and Dan Uggla hit fourth as Jones was given a break after playing both games of Saturday's doubleheader. Jones entered the game as a pinch-hitter in the sixth.	Uggla led off the second with a triple and, following a walk to Eric Hinske, scored on Freddie Freeman's single. The Braves loaded the bases following a single by Alex Gonzalez, but with one out Hanson whiffed on a squeeze play and Hinske was caught in a run-down between third base and home to end the inning.	Hanson said he didn't miss the sign to bunt.	Hanson struck out nine in five innings but gave up three runs on five hits and two walks.

PHILADELPHIA --  Given a slim chance, the Phillies found a way to beat the National League's best bullpen.	After all, an unearned run still counts.	Carlos Ruiz hit the go-ahead sacrifice fly in the eighth inning after a Marlins error, and the Philadelphia Phillies beat Florida 3-2 on Sunday.	Ryan Howard began the eighth by reaching on an error by left-fielder Logan Morrison, who was sliding in as the ball ricocheted off his glove. The Marlins were protecting against an extra-base hit, so Morrison was playing more toward left-center field.	Ben Francisco followed with a single off Ryan Webb (0-2), and Raul Ibanez put runners on the corners with a groundout. Ruiz followed with a soft fly to center.	Ryan Madson (1-0) tossed a scoreless eighth after taking over for Cole Hamels, and Jose Contreras, subbing for injured closer Brad Lidge, survived a rocky ninth inning for his third save in as many chances.	"Anytime you win the game, it's good," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said. "Whether you win ugly or win beautiful, it's positive. It's always positive when you're winning."	Morrison was especially hard on himself for not making the catch.	"It was off the edge of my glove," he said. "I was playing no doubles back in left-center field, so it was a long run, but it's a play that has to be made."	Contreras walked two batters in the ninth and allowed Marlins runners to reach second and third with two outs, but got Omar Infante to ground to third to end the game.	"Those things are going to happen," Manuel said. "His stuff wasn't as quick as usual. He was scuffling, but he needed an out and he got it."	In throwing two scoreless innings, the Marlins actually lowered their league-leading bullpen ERA to 1.89, though they fell to 4-3 in decisions by allowing the unearned run.	The Phillies jumped ahead with two runs in the first off Anibal Sanchez. Placido Polanco hit a solo homer, a shot that barely reached the right-center field seats. He later singled to make him 7 for 13 against Sanchez. Jimmy Rollins walked, stole second and advanced to third on catcher Buck's throwing error, and Ibanez eventually made it 2-0 with a single up the middle.	"The first inning, the wind helped Polanco for the home run," Sanchez said. "He didn't hit it so hard for that kind of home run. That stuff happens. I made a couple of mistakes in the first inning. I went deep in the count with a lot of hitters and that made me throw a lot of pitches in the six innings."	After Ibanez's single, Sanchez allowed only four more hits through his six innings.	Hamels began by striking out six of the first 10 batters he faced, and the left-hander only surrendered two hits through the first five innings.	"I felt good early, and even later," Hamels said. "I was able to make pitches for the most part."	The Marlins finally broke through in the sixth, when Omar Infante began the inning with a double and Mike Stanton drove him in. Stanton went to third on a single by Gaby Sanchez and later scored on Morrison's sacrifice fly.	"I left a few pitches up," Hamels said. "They have good hitters on that club. I was happy we were able to come away with a win."	A crowd of 45,716 was the second-largest in the regular season in the eight-year history of Citizens Bank Park. It was the 131st consecutive regular-season sellout, and the Phillies improved to 72-26 in Sunday games since the stadium opened in 2004.	Game notes	 Phillies RHP Roy Oswalt, who left Friday's game with lower back strain after six innings, is expected to make his next start Thursday in San Diego. He is scheduled to throw a bullpen session Monday. ... Polanco's homer was his first since July 22, 2010, a span of 322 at-bats. ... Marlins INF Donnie Murphy is expected to miss his second straight game with a bruised left knee. He fouled a ball off his kneecap in the ninth inning on Friday and couldn't finish the at-bat. ... Florida will start Josh Johnson after a day off Monday. Ricky Nolasco and Chris Volstad will wrap up the three-game series against the Pirates. ... Gaby Sanchez has reached base safely in all 14 games this season, 18 including last year.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

WASHINGTON --  Jason Marquis kept his cool through a bases-loaded jam in the fourth inning. The Nationals then rewarded him with all the run support he would need.	Marquis cruised into the eighth inning, and Danny Espinosa and Ivan Rodriguez each hit three-run home runs to power the Washington Nationals past the Milwaukee Brewers 8-4 Sunday in the first game of a doubleheader.	Ian Desmond also homered for the Nationals, who set season bests with eight runs and 11 hits.	"I was just trying to keep the team in the game as best as possible, and the offense exploded there in the middle innings," Marquis said.	Marquis (1-0) allowed two runs on nine hits in seven-plus innings. He struck out four and walked one. It was Marquis' first home win in eight tries with the Nationals.	His only real problems came in the fourth, when Milwaukee loaded the bases on singles by Casey McGehee, Mark Kotsay and Carlos Gomez. The Brewers' starting pitcher, Yovani Gallardo, came up with one out and singled to right field, scoring McGehee and giving Milwaukee a 2-0 lead. Marquis got out of the jam by retiring Rickie Weeks on a foul popup and getting Craig Counsell to ground out to short.	"My focus has changed a lot this year, to just pounding the strike zone as much as possible and letting my defense help me out," Marquis said. "I feel a lot more relaxed with that mindset."	Marquis only allowed one more hit after Gallardo's RBI.	"He was real good," Washington manager Jim Riggleman said. "A little trouble early, and Gallardo got him -- he's a real good hitting pitcher. It could have got ugly, but I thought we played real good defense."	Espinosa's second homer of the season gave the Nationals a 4-2 lead in the fifth inning. One inning later Rodriguez hit his first home run of the year, making it a five-run lead.	Gallardo (1-1) allowed seven runs on 10 hits, striking out five without a walk. McGehee was 3 for 5 with an RBI for the Brewers, who dropped the first two games in the three-game series.	"I felt good," Gallardo said. "As the game went on, at two strikes, they fouled off some good pitches in the zone and they waited for that mistake. Once I left the ball up in the zone, they took advantage of it."	Saturday's game was postponed by rain, leading to the first doubleheader at Nationals Park since a twin-bill with the Giants on June 4, 2009.	It was the first time this season the Nationals have hit three home runs in a game, and the offensive show was a welcome sight for Washington, which entered the day last in the National League in both batting average and slugging percentage.	"We've got a lot of guys who haven't been hitting on all cylinders yet," Riggleman said. "We've got four or five guys who're not quite there yet. But that's why you've got to try to scratch out wins when you're going through that, because this isn't going to be the only time we have a little trouble."	One lineup change paid dividends for the Nationals. Espinosa was moved to the leadoff spot on Friday, replacing the slumping Desmond, who started the season 0 for 29 at home before his sixth-inning double. Desmond, batting sixth, hit his second homer of the season in the eighth.	After Rick Ankiel singled in the first inning, Gallardo retired 10 consecutive batters. Jayson Werth ended that streak with a fourth-inning single to left. Werth scored on Michael Morse's sacrifice fly to make the score 2-1.	Gallardo had more trouble in the fifth, giving up singles to Alex Cora and Marquis before Espinosa sent a full-count fastball into the Nationals' right field bullpen.	In the sixth inning, Morse's single and Desmond's double set up Rodriguez's homer, which just cleared the wall above the out-of-town scoreboard in right-center field.	The Brewers scored two runs after loading the bases in the ninth inning.	Game notes	 Washington placed RHP Todd Coffey on the 15-day disabled list (left calf strain) retroactive to April 9 and recalled RHP Collin Balester from Triple-A Syracuse. ... The Nationals' starting pitcher has lasted at least five innings in every game this season. ... Milwaukee OF Nyjer Morgan (right thigh bruise) did not start in the first game. Morgan, who was traded to the Brewers from the Nationals in March, grounded out as a pinch-hitter in the seventh inning. ... Brewers RHP Zack Greinke (fractured left rib) will travel with the team to Philadelphia, and then leave to make his first rehab start for Class-A Brevard County on Tuesday. ... Brewers OF Ryan Braun has reached base in all 14 games this season.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Brian Duensing gave the Minnesota bullpen another chance, and this time the result was a victory.	Duensing allowed two runs over seven innings, Matt Tolbert had an RBI triple and the Twins stopped a four-game skid with a 4-2 win over the Tampa Bay Rays on Sunday.	"We needed a big start," Minnesota manager Ron Gardenhire said. "It's about time we won a ballgame. We actually played well enough in this series to win three ballgames [out of four] and we only come out of here with one. We'll take the one today."	Duensing (1-0) scattered seven hits, walked two and struck out five.	"We've been struggling a little bit lately," Duensing said. "We got that win today and hopefully we'll start rolling."	Jason Repko had an RBI single and Tolbert drove in a run with triple during a three-run fifth against Jeremy Hellickson (1-2) as Minnesota took a 4-2 lead.	After Glen Perkins worked out of a two-on, one-out jam in the eighth by getting a double-play grounder from Ben Zobrist, Matt Capps got the final three outs for his first save.	Capps is replacing Joe Nathan as the Twins' closer. Nathan, who missed all of last season after having right elbow ligament replacement surgery, has been inconsistent and will work in non-save situations.	Nathan had blown saves Thursday and Saturday in games that the Rays eventually won.	"There's anxiety towards the end of the game right now," Gardenhire said. "I think that's always the case with most teams. Our team lost a couple of them. You definitely felt your heart pumping a little bit more. Some good things happened out there."	Tampa Bay left fielder Johnny Damon left with a bruise on the tip of his left ring finger. He was hurt while attempting to bunt during the third and was replaced defensively by Matt Joyce in the fifth.	The Rays said X-rays were negative and that Damon's status is day to day.	"It's very sore," Damon said. "Really tough to squeeze anything. It's pretty bruised. It's just very unfortunate. Hopefully I'll be ready to go as soon as possible."	Minnesota first baseman Justin Morneau was scratched from the lineup because of the flu. Center fielder Denard Span, who had played in the Twins' first 14 games this season, was rested.	Hellickson gave up four runs and six hits in seven innings for the Rays, who had won five in a row.	"Anytime you win a series, that's a good thing," Tampa Bay manager Joe Maddon said. "I like the fact that we wanted to go four out of four. We wanted the fourth one and they just beat us today."	Damon put Tampa Bay up 1-0 with a run-scoring single in the third. Damon has 2,584 career hits, which ties him for 79th place all-time with Reggie Jackson.	Damon set a career high by having at least one RBI in six consecutive games.	Jason Kubel tied it at 1 on a fourth-inning home run. He has two of Minnesota's five homers this season, with his other coming on Saturday.	Sean Rodriguez stopped an 0-for-13 slide with an RBI triple later in the fourth that gave the Rays a 2-1 advantage.	Minnesota's Jim Thome reached on an infield single in the eighth when Rays shortstop Elliot Johnson lost a high pop fly in the roof of the stadium. The ball landed between the mound and the infield dirt.	Game notes	 A thinner-looking Minnesota C Joe Mauer (viral infection) was back at the ballpark after spending the previous two days at the team hotel. Mauer said he has lost 12 pounds. ... Damon has a nine-game hitting streak. ... Kubel is 3 for 5 with two homers overall against Hellickson. ... Thome has 106 career infield hits. ... Minnesota recalled RHP Jim Hoey from Triple-A Rochester and optioned RHP Jeff Manship to the International League club.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

HOUSTON --  Will Venable gave the Padres the lead with his bat and almost gave it back with his glove.	Venable hit a two-run single in a four-run eighth inning and the San Diego Padres rallied for an 8-6 victory over the Houston Astros on Sunday.	Then, he made closer Heath Bell's job tougher in the ninth when he misplayed a flyball for an error, helping the Astros load the bases.	"All is well that ends well," Venable said.	Bell got his 38th consecutive save the hard way. He loaded the bases with one out in the ninth and then got the last two batters on a strikeout and groundout.	"I thought Will had that ball," Bell said. "I had to pick Will up at that point."	The Padres salvaged a split in the four-game series. Houston hasn't won a series over San Diego since June 29-July 2, 2009, and the Padres haven't lost a series in Houston since 2005.	Trailing 6-4 at the start of the eighth, the Padres got a run on Jason Bartlett's one-out RBI single. Pinch-hitter Brad Hawpe walked to load the bases then Venable singled to right field for the go-ahead hit off Mark Melancon (1-1).	Jeff Fulchino came on and walked pinch-hitter Orlando Hudson to load the bases again and Jorge Cantu walked to force in the fourth run of the inning.	"Will got on the high fastball and lined it out to center," Padres manager Bud Black said. "That was a big hit. We had some good at-bats all through that [eighth inning]. We didn't extend the zone, we swung at strikes and took balls."	Ernesto Frieri (1-1) pitched 1 2/3 innings for the victory. He struck out three and allowed one hit.	Jason Michaels singled off Bell to start the Astros ninth. Chris Johnson struck out and Brett Wallace walked. Humberto Quintero hit a long fly to Venable, the right fielder, who missed the ball for an error loading the bases. Matt Downs struck out of a full count and Jason Bourgeois grounded out to end the game.	"I don't know what it is, maybe we were playing a big uphill battle," Bell said. "We weren't getting that big hit. We've got to fight and scratch and claw for every win right now. Maybe I've got to do that, too."	Venable took credit for the dramatic ninth inning.	"I have no excuses," Venable said. "I will say the lights made it tougher on me than it needed to be but that's a play you have to make."	Brett Myers extended his string of pitching at least six innings to 36 of his last 37 starts. He allowed a solo homer to Nick Hundley in the second and a two-run shot to Cantu in the fifth. Myers struck out four and walked two.	"I try to leave everything on the field when I go out there," Myers said. "I don't try to back down from anything, even if I'm not feeling as good as I think I should feel that day. I'm still going to go out there and battle and give us a chance to win."	San Diego's Clayton Richard pitched 5 1/3 innings, and allowed seven hits, walked one and struck out five.	"I could tell my stuff wasn't as good as it's been in the past," Richard said. "We were faced with a tough situation later in the game but the bats pulled through and of course the bullpen did a tremendous job."	Hundley led off the second inning with a first-pitch home run, his third of the season. Myers then struck out Ryan Ludwick and Cameron Maybin tripled over center fielder Bourgeois' head.	Maybin was caught in a rundown on a grounder by Bartlett and Myers struck out Richard to keep it a one-run game.	Bill Hall, hitless in his previous 10 at-bats, gave the Astros the lead with a two-run single in the second. Michaels walked and Johnson doubled before Hall singled down the first base line. He was caught trying to take second.	Houston got two more runs in the third on an RBI double by Hunter Pence and Carlos Lee's RBI single.	Cantu's two-run homer in the fifth continued his success against Myers. Cantu is hitting .450 for his career against Myers.	"We've played so well defensively so far," Astros manager Brad Mills said. "I think going into yesterday we were the top team defensively -- and so to see that fall apart. That's something we haven't been doing. That was tough."	Game notes	 Hudson's 11-game hitting streak ended Saturday night but he still has reached base in all 15 games this season. He was 0 for 3 Saturday with a walk. He is 6 for 6 on stolen bases this season. ... Hawpe has the second best batting average against Houston among active players (50 for 145, .345.)	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CHICAGO --  Dan Haren hasn't had a problem following every Jered Weaver masterpiece.	Haren pitched into the seventh inning for his fourth win of the season, Maicer Izturis had three hits and the Los Angeles Angels beat the Chicago White Sox 4-2 on Sunday to complete a three-game sweep.	Haren (4-0) joined Weaver as the major leagues' first four-game winners. The right-hander allowed two runs on seven hits over 6 1/3 innings, striking out six and not allowing a walk.	"He's started the series three times and he's set the tone every time," Haren said. "There is a lot of teams with a bunch of good pitchers and we're a few of them. What we hope is that when [we] take the mound our team expects to win. That's how I feel and I feel like when I'm on the mound that the eight other guys with me feel like we're going to win that game."	After initially struggling in the ninth, rookie closer Jordan Walden got Juan Pierre to pop out to left with the bases loaded for his third save in as many opportunities.	Mark Trumbo added a solo shot in the fourth inning off White Sox starter Mark Buehrle (1-1), as Chicago lost its fourth straight game. The White Sox opened their 10-game homestand winning four of the first six, and three of their losses were blown saves by the bullpen.	"In most of the games we were one shot away from winning it, but we didn't," White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen said. "The beginning it was the bullpen letting the team down. We're struggling to swing the bat right now. Leaving Chicago, long road trip, those guys will come around and start swinging the bat like we know they can."	Haren retired nine straight White Sox batters until allowing a double to Carlos Quentin in the seventh inning. After an infield hit by Alex Rios, Haren gave up back-to-back run-scoring singles to A.J. Pierzynski and Alexei Ramirez.	Haren had pitched 19 scoreless innings until giving up the two RBI singles.	"He is on a terrific roll. He's not going to throw one-hitters every time out. You can look at a lot of different numbers, but I don't think you need numbers to see how well Dan has been pitching. This guy has been very consistent early on," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.	Haren, who has 1.16 ERA, is even surprising himself with his dominance.	"I didn't see it coming," he said. "I felt pretty good in spring. I've done a really good job of keeping the defense in the game, minimizing walks and working ahead in the account. That's my game, nothing fancy. I just pitch my game and hitters adjust to me."	Hisanori Takahashi and Francisco Rodriguez each got one out in the seventh inning and Fernando Rodney pitched a scoreless eighth before turning the game over to Walden.	He gave up a leadoff double to Quentin and walked Rios in the ninth. Pierzynski moved the runners over on a sacrifice bunt, but Walden rebounded by striking out Ramirez. After issuing a walk to Omar Vizquel, Walden got Pierre to pop out to end the game.	The Angels struck first when Izturis lined Buehrle's fourth pitch of the game down the line in left for a double. Howard Kendrick followed with a hard grounder back at Buehrle, who kicked the ball and misdirected it from Ramirez at shortstop into the outfield for a single. Bobby Abreu struck out before Torii Hunter drove in Izturis on a sacrifice fly.	Izturis doubled again in the third and scored on Abreu's double to make it 2-0.	"He's pitched great for us the second half of last year and even though we're not giving him tons of support those early runs this afternoon were important for him, especially for a guy that pounds the zone," Scioscia said.	Trumbo's homer in the fourth made it 3-0, and Vernon Wells hit a liner off the outfield wall in the sixth. He went to third on the triple and eventually scored on Alberto Callaspo's single.	Scioscia questioned whether Wells' drive was a home run. The umpires reviewed the video and determined the original call was correct.	Buehrle allowed four runs on 10 hits in seven innings. He struck out five and walked two.	"I made a couple mistakes today and they made me pay for it," he said. "Any time you run into Weaver and Haren in two out of three games, it's a tough task at hand."

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Michael Pineda is giving the Seattle Mariners hope they have found a formidable pitcher to pair with Cy Young winner Felix Hernandez atop their rotation.	Pineda, a 22-year-old with a 99 mph fastball, held Kansas City to one run and three hits over six innings, Brendan Ryan had a tiebreaking two-run single and the Mariners beat the Royals 3-2 Sunday to snap a four-game losing streak.	Pineda (2-1) has a 2.33 ERA in three starts, while holding opponents to 13 hits and striking out 16 in 19 1/3 innings.	"I can't say enough about this guy," Ryan said. "From the end of spring training, I've said this guy has a legit shot to be the rookie of the year. You see his stuff. You make guys look the way they do on all three pitches, he's outstanding and he's only going to get better. ... He's got a great chance to be something special."	Jamey Wright pitched two hitless innings, while walking two. Brandon League gave up a run in the ninth on Wilson Betemit's single, but finished for his third save.	"Pineda's fastball is as good as I've ever seen," said Wright, a 13-year major league veteran. "He throws strikes and attacks hitters with it. His breaking stuff is only to get better. When you're throwing 97-98 (mph) there's so much more you can get away with. He's going to be good. Once his breaking stuff gets even better, he has a chance to be really special."	The Royals entered the game leading the American League with a .279 average, but managed just five hits, matching their season low.	"The kid's got electric stuff," Royals manager Ned Yost said of Pineda. "We weren't chasing pitches outside the zone. The kid's got a live arm. It was our first look at him. He's got a good fastball and breaking ball and he threw strikes. He's in there throwing 95 with his fastball and with a sharp breaking ball."	Ryan laced a single to left in the seventh to score Justin Smoak and Miguel Olivo to snap a 1-all tie. Smoak led off the inning with a single and advanced to second when Olivo ended an 0-for-27 skid with a single. Ryan Langerhans' sacrifice bunt advanced both runners.	Blake Wood then replaced Jeff Francis and Ryan brought home both runners with a hit on a 3-1 pitch. The Mariners won for only the third time in 14 games.	"I think I can safely speak for everybody we're not having fun right now," Ryan said. "I'm not having any fun. This is not how I wanted to start out the season, personally and as a team. We're going to get better. Hopefully things will start falling and start going our way, because they haven't."	Francis (0-1) is still searching for his first victory with the Royals. He was charged with three runs on six hits, while walking none and striking out one in 6 1/3 innings.	Jeff Francoeur led off the Royals' fifth with a one-hop double off the right-field fence, the only extra-base hit off Pineda. He advanced to third on Betemit's fly out to center. Brayan Pena's sacrifice fly scored Francoeur for the only run Pineda would allow.	"We knew he threw hard and then we saw he had 99 (mph) on the second pitch of the game," Francoeur said. "We had to give ourselves a chance to swing the bats."	The Mariners tied it in the sixth with Ichiro Suzuki starting the inning with a double down the right-field line. He scored on Milton Bradley's two-out triple to right. That snapped a Mariners 14-inning scoreless drought.	Royals left-fielder Alex Gordon singled in the first to extend his hitting streak to 11 games, the longest active streak in the majors and one game shy of his career best.	Game notes	 RHP David Aardsma, who saved 31 games last season for the Mariners, will begin a minor league rehab assignment Tuesday with Triple-A Tacoma. Aardsma had hip surgery in January and is on the disabled list. ... The Royals took three of four from the Mariners and are the only team in the American League that has not lost a series this season.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DENVER --  Dexter Fowler swung through the first slider that he saw from Cubs reliever Marcos Mateo. He didn't miss the next one.	Fowler's two-out, two-run double ignited a four-run eighth inning and the Colorado Rockies went on to beat the Chicago Cubs 9-5 Sunday for their eighth victory in nine games.	With the score tied at 5, the Rockies sent 10 batters to the plate in the eighth to break the game open. Ryan Spilborghs began the inning with an infield single off Mateo (0-1) and Jose Lopez doubled, breaking out of an 0-for-18 skid.	After Jose Morales and pinch-hitter Ty Wiggington each fanned on wicked sliders by Mateo, Fowler lashed Mateo's 2-2 offering to right center to give the Rockies the lead. Jonathan Herrera and Carlos Gonzalez, who had four hits on the day, followed with RBI singles.	"He tried to get ahead of me with the fastball but his slider is his go-to pitch," Fowler said. "I swung through one but I just had to stay patient. He threw another and I just wanted to put the barrel on it and do something with it."	He did enough to help Colorado bounce back from a rare early season loss the day before, 8-3 to the Cubs.	"We have a bunch of different weapons and we can hurt you a bunch of different ways," Fowler said. "I'm just happy it was my turn. And it was important to come off [Saturday's loss] like we did. It shows the character of the team. We had lost a couple of close games but that was our first real blowout. We bounced back nicely."	Chicago manager Mike Quade said Fowler helped make the difference by getting hold of a good pitch.	"The one thing that Matty couldn't do, because he made some good pitches, was he couldn't finish somebody with a slider down and out of the strike zone, and that's what he needed to do," Quade said. "It's a quality slider but just couldn't get it down enough."	Neither starter figured in the decision and both Chicago's Ryan Dempster and Colorado's Alan Johnson, who was making his major league debut, did not fare well in the cool, blustery conditions at Coors Field.	Dempster gave up five runs on seven hits in five innings while Johnson was touched for five runs on six hits in four innings.	"I give Alan Johnson credit. He battled," Colorado manager Jim Tracy said. "He got himself into some pickles due to the fact he was trying to pitch out of hitters' counts. They dinged him here. They dinged him there."	But Chicago didn't touch Colorado's four relievers, who pitched five scoreless innings.	Rafael Betancourt (1-0), the fourth of five Rockies pitchers, entered in the eighth and picked up the win with two-thirds innings of hitless relief.	"They've been absolutely tremendous, to take the game over from the fifth inning on and put zeroes up there," Tracy said. "You can't say enough."	The Rockies overcame the loss of a key part of their offense when Seth Smith was lifted in the top of the fifth inning because of tightness in his left groin. He hit a two-run homer and doubled and scored before being replaced by Spilborghs. His playing status was day to day.	The Rockies got to Dempster for four runs in the first inning but fell behind 5-4 in the fourth after Geovany Soto walked, was sacrificed to second and then scored on Starlin Castro's two-out double off Johnson.	The game was tied again in the bottom of the fourth when Smith scored from third on a groundout by Jose Morales after doubling to start the inning.	Soto's RBI single in the second pulled Chicago to 4-2. The Cubs evened the score 4-all when Aramis Ramirez delivered a run-scoring single and Darwin Barney came home on second baseman Herrera's errant throw to first while trying to complete a double play.	Gonzalez, whose four hits in a game matched a career high, started the Rockies' first-inng rally with a run-scoring double and Smith followed an RBI single by Todd Helton with a home run that sailed into the bleachers behind the center field fence.	Castro, who singled to start the game and finished with three hits, scored on a double play grounder in the first.	Game notes	 Dempster fanned Johnson in the fourth for his fourth strikeout of the game, pushing his career total to 1,600. ... A year ago to the day, Ubaldo Jimenez threw the first no-hitter in Rockies' history against the Atlanta Braves at Turner Field. Jimenez (right thumb) is set to make his second start this season when he returns from the disabled list on Tuesday against San Francisco. ... In going 4 for 5 on Saturday, Castro at 21 years, 24 days old is the youngest player in the majors. He became the first Cubs player to get four hits, including a home run, in a game, before his 22nd birthday since Ron Santo did it twice in 1961.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  Trevor Cahill was the perfect remedy for Oakland's weary bullpen, answering a challenge laid out before the game by manager Bob Geren.	Then again, the Athletics' starters have been that way most of the season -- a pattern that has to continue if this pesky team is going to make a run in the AL West.	Cahill had a season-high nine strikeouts while scattering four hits in eight innings, and the A's beat the Detroit Tigers 5-1 on Sunday.	"I knew yesterday the bullpen was used pretty well and today I was going to have to help it out and go deeper in the game," Cahill said. "I got ahead a lot, throwing the first pitch for strikes, and as the game went along [Detroit] started getting more aggressive."	Oakland's All-Star right-hander had at least one strikeout in each of the first four innings and baffled the Tigers hitters with a steady stream of off-speed pitches and a sinker that had Detroit off balance all afternoon.	It's the third time in four starts this year that Cahill has had at least seven strikeouts. He did not walk a batter for the second time this season.	"We joked with him before the game that he had to be the starter, the middle guy, the setup guy and the closer," Geren said. "He definitely answered the challenge."	Josh Willingham broke out of a slump with a two-run single in the fifth, Mark Ellis doubled twice and Daric Barton walked twice and scored both times to help the A's salvage a split of the four-game series. Oakland also won its second straight at home after losing four of its first five at the Coliseum this year.	Brad Penny gave up five runs in five-plus innings and took the loss for Detroit. The Tigers had 25 hits in the series, 10 in one game.	"Once again it was a lack of offense," Detroit manager Jim Leyland said. "We didn't do much offensively. We have to upgrade the concentration level a little."	Cahill (2-0) looked nothing like the pitcher who struggled against the Chicago White Sox on Tuesday, a day after signing a new $30.5 million, five-year extension with the A's.	"He was lights out today, dominant," Oakland infielder Andy LaRoche said. "He made one mistake all game, a curveball. Other than that they were looking pretty foolish on a lot of the pitches. That's nothing against them, they have a terrific lineup. It's just showing how outstanding Cahill was today."	Cahill gave up a solo home run on a hanging curve to Casper Wells leading off the sixth but was dominant the rest of the way while throwing a season-high 112 pitches.	That prevented the Tigers from notching their first four-game series win in Oakland since 1997. Cahill's effort also followed up on similar outings from fellow starters Gio Gonzalez, Brandon McCarthy and Dallas Braden. The four A's starters allowed just one unearned runs and two overall in 25 2/3 innings.	"Just look at the numbers. There aren't words to describe it," Tigers catcher Alex Avila said. "They have a lot of good arms. We struggled a bit at the plate obviously because they have a good staff. Maybe if we could have put together a few more runs these last couple days, it might have been a different story."	Tyson Ross gave up a single in the ninth but retired the next three Detroit batters to complete the five-hitter for Oakland.	Penny matched Cahill early but gave up a run in the fourth on a ball that appeared to be going foul.	Barton walked and took third on Conor Jackson's single. After a strikeout, Hideki Matsui hit a dribbler that Penny grabbed just as the ball rolled onto the chalk along the first base line. He threw to first for the out but Barton scored to make it 1-0.	Penny (0-2) hurt himself again in the fifth after giving up a leadoff double to backup catcher Landon Powell. Penny retired the next two hitters but hit David DeJesus and walked Barton. Manager Jim Leyland came out to calm Penny but the burly right-hander walked Jackson to force in one run, then gave up a two-run single to Willingham.	That continued a troubling trend for Penny, who left after Ellis' leadoff double in the sixth. Penny allowed only four hits in his first-ever appearance in Oakland but was charged with five runs and now has an 8.44 ERA.	Cahill continued to cruise and was especially tough on Tigers left fielder Ryan Raburn, who struck out three times on his 30th birthday.	Detroit scored its only run on Wells' first home run of the season. The solo shot came on an 0-2 pitch and is only the second allowed by Cahill this year.	Game notes	 Braden, who was forced out of Saturday's win against Detroit with shoulder stiffness, saw an orthopedist on Sunday but there was no immediate word from the team on what the outcome was. ... Tigers C Victor Martinez was held out of the lineup after he tweaked a groin muscle in his last at-bat Saturday. .. The Tigers did not hit a double in a game for the first time this season, ending their longest streak to start a season since at least 1919.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

LOS ANGELES --  Chad Billingsley cooled off one of baseball's hottest offenses through eight innings before Matt Kemp got to Ryan Franklin again. This time, his homer salvaged a victory for the struggling Los Angeles Dodgers.	Kemp hit a two-run shot in the bottom of the ninth inning for a 2-1 win over the St. Louis Cardinals on Sunday that ended the Dodgers' five-game skid.	"It's one way to turn the page," new Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said. "We talked about getting that rock rolling a different direction. It's got to start somewhere and that's a pretty good start there."	Kemp homered to center field on a 2-2 pitch from Franklin (0-2), who has four blown saves in five chances. He did the same thing against Franklin in the series opener, but the Dodgers lost 9-5.	"He left one a little bit over the middle of the plate and I just kept my hands still," Kemp said. "He's got a really good sinker and a really good curveball and a cutter, so he moves the ball a lot. You've got to try to get a pitch in the middle and use your hands, and that's what I did."	He went 3 for 4 for his fourth consecutive multi-hit game, and his .474 average leads the majors.	Andre Ethier led off with a double to deep right field off Trever Miller in his final at-bat, extending his major league-leading hitting streak to 14 games.	Jonathan Broxton (1-0) got the win despite giving up a two-out RBI single in the top of the ninth by David Freese.	The Dodgers avoided their first four-game sweep at home since Aug. 9-12, 1993, against Colorado.	"It's been one of these tough breaks now where things haven't gone our way, but we're not going to hang our heads," Ethier said. "We found a way to bounce back."	The victory prevented the Cardinals from earning their first four-game sweep in Los Angeles since 1968. Their four-game winning streak also ended after piling up 48 hits and 29 runs in the first three games of the series.	Chris Carpenter and Billingsley dueled in a matchup of two of the National League's best daytime starters over the last five-plus seasons.	Carpenter allowed five hits over seven innings, struck out six and walked none, and now has a 1.57 ERA in nine career starts against the Dodgers.	"I commanded the ball well. My cutter was good and I had command of my fastball on both sides of the plate and kept the ball down," he said. "I was trying to be aggressive in the strike zone and I was ahead in the count for the most part. That's a pretty good lineup and every guy can hurt you in many different ways."	Billingsley gave up a season-low two hits over eight innings, struck out a season-high 11, and walked none in his longest outing of the season.	"It was one of the best outings from a starter that I've seen in a while," former Dodger Ryan Theriot said about Billingsley. "He was cutting it and he was sinking it. He was throwing the cutter in and throwing it away, the sinker in and away. He had a big curve ball and a slider at 91 miles an hour. How many starters throw a slider at 91? He got me on it once."	Mattingly let Billingsley go deep in part because the Dodgers' bullpen has been so shoddy lately.	"He was clean all day," Mattingly said. "His stuff was good and sharp. That club is on fire, so to stop that momentum was huge."	It was Kemp's second career game-winning homer. The other came last June 1 in a 1-0, 10-inning win over Arizona.	The only other time the Dodgers advanced a runner to third came with two outs in the third. Tony Gwynn Jr. was safe at first on a fielding error by shortstop Theriot. He moved to third on Jamey Carroll's infield single before Ethier lined out to first to end the inning.	Matt Holliday went 3 for 3 and scored the Cardinals' only run. He batted .563 with five doubles and five RBIs in the series.	The Cardinals didn't advance a runner to third until the eighth. Yadier Molina was safe at second when Ethier tried to shade his eyes with his left hand while attempting to make the catch in right field, but the ball dropped behind him for an error.	"I just overplayed it. I was at a tough angle," he said. "I looked down and took my eye off the ball."	Daniel Descalso sacrificed Molina to third, but pinch-hitter Jon Jay struck out and Theriot flied to right to end the inning.	Game notes	 Billingsley struck out 10 or more batters for the seventh time in his career and first since last Sept. 26 at Arizona. ... The Cardinals' streak of scoring six or more runs ended at seven games, something they hadn't done since July 25-Aug. 3, 2004, when they did so in eight straight. ... Kemp came in leading the majors with a .453 batting average and has now hit safely in 14 of the Dodgers' 16 games. Last year, he led the team in homers with 28.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

PHOENIX --  Stephen Drew was ready for Javier Lopez on Sunday afternoon.	Drew drove in Justin Upton with one out in the 12th inning, and the Arizona Diamondbacks rallied to beat the San Francisco Giants 6-5.	"I kind of knew what he had," Drew said. "I was looking for something to get the ball up and put a good swing on it."	Giants reliever Dan Runzler had allowed only one base runner over 2 1/3 innings before walking Upton and Chris Young with one out in the 12th. Lopez came on for Runzler (1-2) and gave up Drew's grounder into the right-field hole on his third pitch.	"That's where I hit him where I hit him," said Arizona manager Kirk Gibson. "That's the money position right there. It might not look like it but he hates to fail as much as anybody."	Josh Collmenter (1-0) pitched two perfect innings in his major league debut for the win as the Diamondbacks snapped a four-game losing streak.	"I couldn't have dream for it to go better, to get the walk-off win and celebrate with the rest of the team," said Collmenter, who was making his first relief appearance since 2007 in his first season of pro ball.	Collmenter said it helped to face Buster Posey and Brandon Belt, former opponents from the California League.	"Just having the familiar faces was a relief to me," Collmenter said. "I wasn't facing star after star that I see on TV. To see guys that I'd faced before put things in perspective."	Posey and Pablo Sandoval hit back-to-back home runs in the sixth inning and Aubrey Huff also homered for the Giants, who saw their four-game winning streak end.	"Games like that it takes a little two-hopper through the hole and you get the game done," Huff said. "It was one of those tough beats but we won three series in a row and that's all you can ask for."	Upton also singled and hit his team-leading fourth home run for the Diamondbacks, who won for the third time in their last 16 games against the Giants.	Ryan Roberts tied the game at 5-5 in the eighth with a single through the hole at shortstop off Jeremy Affeldt, driving in Xavier Nady. He had earned a two-out walk off Ramon Ramirez, the first he had allowed in 9 2/3 innings across nine appearances.	"These games are tough," Gibson said. "They had their way with us the first two games. Confidence is big in this game. I'm very proud of the guys and the way they hung in there."	Diamondbacks starter Barry Enright was solid through the first five innings, allowing only Huff's homer in the fourth and fifth-inning walks to Sandoval and Brandon Belt. But Aaron Rowand, leading off the sixth, fouled a pitch off catcher Miguel Montero's groin to cause a lengthy delay. Montero stayed in the game but Enright was unable to regain his prior form.	Rowand doubled to left, went to third on Freddy Sanchez's single to left and scored on Huff's sacrifice fly to right. Posey followed with a home run into the left-field bullpen.	"That little time off threw me off a little bit but that's part of the game," Enright said. "You have to come out there and be as effective."	Enright said he had motioned to plate umpire C.B. Bucknor, asking to throw a couple warmup pitches, but Bucknor ordered Rowand into the batters' box.	Vasquez came on for Enright and surrendered a towering home run to right to Sandoval on the second pitch he threw for a 5-4 lead. It was the Giants' first back-to-back homers this season.	San Francisco starter Madison Bumgarner allowed four runs on eight hits over 6 2/3 innings with a walk and two strikeouts.	"The pitching was there," said Giants manager Bruce Bochy. "We just didn't get the hits."	Game notes	 Affeldt had stranded five of seven inherited runners entering the game. ... Bumgarner pitched only 1 1/3 innings less than he did his first two starts combined. ... Enright has not pitched past the sixth inning since Sept. 24, a span of four starts. ... Upton's home run carried onto the concourse beyond the left-field fence, his second to reach the concourse in six days. ... Giants LHP Barry Zito was placed on the 15-day DL with a sprain in his right mid-foot. Zito hurt it Saturday when he dove forward in front of the mound to catch a bunt. Zito will see a podiatrist in San Francisco on Monday. ... San Francisco purchased the contract of RHP Ryan Vogelsong from Triple-A Fresno to take Zito's spot. Vogelsong, who last appeared in the majors on June 22, 2006, was 2-0 with a 1.59 ERA in two starts for the Grizzlies. Vogelsong pitched for three seasons in Japan before pitching in the minors for Philadelphia and the Angels last year.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

WASHINGTON --  Danny Espinosa appears comfortable in his new role as leadoff hitter in the Nationals' lineup.	Espinosa, who was moved into the No. 1 spot before Friday's series opener, followed up a three-run homer in the opening game with a bases-loaded triple in the seventh inning of the second game that helped the Washington Nationals to a 5-1 victory Sunday and a doubleheader sweep.	In the opener, Ivan Rodriguez also hit a three-run homer and Jason Marquis pitched into the eighth inning of the Nationals' 8-4 victory.	"It was great to get this sweep," said Espinosa, had six RBIs in the doubleheader and seven in the three-game series sweep. "After we got the first game, we knew in here, we were talking, 'We need to get that sweep. We need this game.' And we went out there and played hard and things went our way."	Several Nationals who had been slumping had big days at the plate.	Jerry Hairston entered with one single in 23 at-bats this season. He homered, doubled and singled for the Nationals in the nightcap. Shortstop Ian Desmond, who was bumped out of the leadoff spot by Espinosa, started the season 0 for 29 at home before his sixth-inning double in the first game. Desmond hit his second homer of the season two innings later.	Washington had five home runs in the doubleheader, and set season bests with eight runs and 11 hits in the opener. The offensive show was a welcome sight for the Nationals, who entered the day last in the National League in both batting average and slugging percentage.	"We've got a lot of veteran guys, and we've tried to tell the young guys, 'Don't panic,'" Hairston said. "It's two weeks. Six, seven, eight, 15 games is nothing over the course of a long season."	Saturday's game was postponed by rain, leading to the first doubleheader at Nationals Park since a twin-bill with the Giants on June 4, 2009. It was the second doubleheader sweep for the Nationals since moving to Washington before the 2005 season. Their first came Aug. 7, 2008, at Colorado.	Washington's starting pitching was as good as its offense Sunday.	Marquis (1-0) allowed two runs and nine hits in seven-plus innings. He struck out four and walked one. It was Marquis' first home win in eight tries with the Nationals.	His only real problems came in the fourth, when Milwaukee loaded the bases on singles by Casey McGehee, Mark Kotsay and Carlos Gomez. The Brewers' starting pitcher, Yovani Gallardo, came up with one out and singled to right field, scoring McGehee and giving Milwaukee a 2-0 lead. Marquis got out of the jam by retiring Rickie Weeks on a foul popup and getting Craig Counsell to ground out to short.	Gallardo (1-1) allowed seven runs on 10 hits, striking out five without a walk. McGehee was 3 for 5 with an RBI for the Brewers.	In the second game, Livan Hernandez (2-1) allowed one run and six hits in seven innings. He struck out three and did not walk a batter. Hernandez retired the first eight men he faced in his longest outing this season.	"Anytime you get a doubleheader you get a little nervous about that pen," said Adam LaRoche, who hit a home run in the eighth inning of the second game. "It was big for Jason and Livan to go as deep as they did and really save some guys down there. They were phenomenal."	Milwaukee's Kameron Loe (1-1) was the loser in the second game. He gave up singles to the first three men he faced, and then Espinosa cleared the bases with his one-out triple to give the Nationals a 4-1 lead.	"I don't think anybody was lacking confidence," Washington manager Jim Riggleman said. "But I think our position players have to feel real good about what they're seeing from our pitchers, and realize that once we get it going we're going to be pretty good. The sooner the better, and we did get it going this whole series."	Game notes	 Washington placed RHP Todd Coffey on the 15-day disabled list (left calf strain) retroactive to April 9 and recalled RHP Collin Balester from Triple-A Syracuse. ... The Nationals' starting pitcher has lasted at least five innings in every game this season. ... Milwaukee OF Nyjer Morgan (right thigh bruise) did not start in either game. Morgan, who was traded to the Brewers from the Nationals in March, grounded out as a pinch-hitter in the seventh inning of the opener. ... Brewers RHP Zack Greinke (fractured left rib) will travel with the team to Philadelphia, and then leave to make his first rehab start for Class-A Brevard County on Tuesday. ... Brewers OF Ryan Braun has reached base in all 15 games this season. ... Nationals OF Jayson Werth was rested in the second game, the first time this season he did not play.

NEW YORK --  Eric Chavez has 230 home runs and a wealth of experience obtained during 13 major league seasons.	That's not a bad bat to have ready on the bench.	Chavez, filling in for an ailing Alex Rodriguez, singled home the tiebreaking run in the eighth inning and the New York Yankees hit three homers off previously untouchable Alexi Ogando to beat the Texas Rangers 6-5 on Sunday night.	"When I made the decision to come here, I knew what it was going to be. Obviously, Alex is going to play a ton of games and when I get in there I've just got to be ready to play," said Chavez, in his initial season with the Yankees after spending his first 13 in Oakland. "I'm going to keep the same approach the whole year."	Robinson Cano, Russell Martin and Curtis Granderson all went deep to help the Yankees take two of three in an early rematch of last year's AL championship series, which Texas won in six games to capture its first pennant.	Adrian Beltre homered, doubled and drove in four runs for the Rangers, who have dropped four of five since opening the season 9-1. Missing injured AL MVP Josh Hamilton, they begin a 10-game homestand Monday night with a three-game series against the AL West rival Angels.	"Bring it on," manager Ron Washington said.	Mark Teixeira drew a one-out walk from Arthur Rhodes (0-1) in the eighth and Nick Swisher singled with two outs. Chavez, in a lefty-on-lefty matchup, lined a single up the middle and Teixeira scored with a slide ahead of the looping throw from center fielder Julio Borbon.	"It was a good pitch, man. It was down and away," Rhodes said. "You've got to tip your hat to the guy when you make a good pitch and he hits it. That was it."	Chavez is 7 for 15 (.467) with three RBIs this season.	"Felt like we had the proper matchup with Arthur against Eric," Washington said. "You've got to give Eric credit."	Rafael Soriano (1-0) pitched scoreless eighth for his first win with the Yankees and Mariano Rivera got three quick outs for his seventh save in seven chances.	Rivera has saved or won each of New York's eight home victories this season.	All three Yankees homers came off Ogando, who allowed just four hits over 13 shutout innings in his previous two starts this season. New York leads the majors with 27 home runs, a club record through 14 games.	Ogando gave up five runs and six hits in 6 1/3 innings. Going into the game, he had allowed two regular-season homers in 54 2/3 career innings.	"He just got it up to them and they hit it," Washington said. "Couldn't go through the whole season without giving up something. The most important thing is, he kept us in the ballgame."	Rodriguez sat out because of stiffness in his lower back and side, but the Yankees flashed plenty of power at the plate in a back-and-forth game that went on uninterrupted through a pair of showers.	In the fourth, bright lightning streaked across the sky and booming thunder clapped as fans scurried for cover from the rain on a 57-degree night.	Joba Chamberlain relieved Yankees ace CC Sabathia in the seventh and immediately walked Ian Kinsler on four pitches. With two outs, Michael Young doubled over Swisher's head in right to tie it at 5. Chamberlain retired Beltre on a comebacker to end the inning.	In the sixth, Derek Jeter hit a leadoff single and Granderson pulled a 1-1 pitch just inside the right-field foul pole. Jeter leaned left to give it some body english and when the drive stayed fair, New York had a 5-4 lead.	Granderson also homered off Ogando in Game 5 of the ALCS last year, the only run that the skinny, long-limbed right-hander allowed in five postseason relief appearances.	A converted outfielder, the 27-year-old Ogando excelled out of the bullpen last season and was only shifted to the starting rotation when Tommy Hunter strained his groin during the final week of spring training.	Beltre hit a two-run shot on a high fastball in the first inning and an RBI single in the fourth, both with two strikes. His run-scoring double in the sixth put Texas up 4-3.	Moments after right fielder Nelson Cruz made a diving catch of Jorge Posada's shallow fly in the fifth, Martin turned on a 94 mph fastball and sent it into the left-field stands for his fourth homer. He hit five in 97 games last season with the Los Angeles Dodgers.	"I just enjoy the intensity," said Martin, rested Saturday for the first time this season. "If you like intense baseball, this is the place to be. So far, I like it."	Texas came right back with Young's leadoff single in the sixth and the RBI double by Beltre, who began the night 3 for 22 (.136) against Sabathia with seven strikeouts.	"Couldn't get him out," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "He's the type of player that can carry a club."	Game notes	 Rangers RHP Brandon Webb (shoulder) had a 70-pitch bullpen session and is slated to throw batting practice Friday in Texas. ... Girardi dropped slumping LF Brett Gardner to ninth in the batting order. Gardner had been hitting leadoff against right-handers. "I'm not saying this is a long-term thing. We're just trying to get him going," Girardi said.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

BOSTON --  Daisuke Matsuzaka wanted to impress his old pitching coach.	Did he ever.	Matsuzaka pitched one-hit ball for seven innings after one of the worst outings of his career and Boston got an early start on its third straight win, beating the Toronto Blue Jays and new manager John Farrell 9-1 on Monday in the Red Sox traditional morning Patriots' Day game.	"Farrell is on the other side so I wanted to show solid pitching in front of him," Matsuzaka said through a translator.	For the past four years Farrell tried, often unsuccessfully, to get Matsuzaka to attack hitters and cut down his pitch count. On Monday, the right-hander threw just 89 pitches against the free-swinging Blue Jays, whose impatience at the plate worked in his favor.	"He threw a very good game," Farrell said. "He's had a lot of success against Toronto in the past and he's used his fastball effectively. He did that today and we weren't able to put good swings on it."	More importantly, Matsuzaka impressed his own manager, Terry Francona, after entering the game with a 12.86 ERA in two starts. Matsuzaka permitted only two baserunners, matching the fewest he's allowed in his 101 major league starts.	"If I did pitch badly," Matsuzaka said, "I thought there wouldn't be the next chance."	The game began at 11:07 a.m. at Fenway Park. The holiday observed in Massachusetts and Maine marks the anniversary of the battles of Lexington and Concord in 1775. Earlier Monday, the 115th Boston Marathon passed through nearby Kenmore Square.	Matsuzaka (1-2) got plenty of support as Jed Lowrie's four hits led a 13-hit, three-homer attack.	Matsuzaka gave up a clean single to center to Jose Bautista with two outs in the first. He walked Travis Snider with two outs in the second, then set down his final 16 batters to improve to 7-1 against the Blue Jays.	He struck out three and walked one. In his previous start against Tampa Bay, he allowed seven runs in two innings.	Toronto finished with two hits. Yunel Escobar homered off Tim Wakefield in the ninth.	Lowrie hit his second homer, a two-run shot in the fifth off Ricky Romero (1-2) that made it 5-0, and finished with four RBIs. He now has 15 hits in his last 24 at-bats.	At one point, Lowrie's .533 batting average was posted on the scoreboard.	"I understand, but who cares? It's April 18. We've got a long season," he said. "You don't think about it. You just continue to do what you're doing and go out there and just let it happen."	Kevin Youkilis and Jacoby Ellsbury also homered.	The festive day marked another special occasion -- a hit by Carl Crawford.	Boston's left fielder, signed to a $142 million, seven-year contract in the offseason, broke an 0-for-15 slump with an RBI double that made it 8-0 in the sixth. Crawford, booed after his previous at-bat, received a standing ovation as he raised his batting average to .136 (8 for 59).	Francona was "thrilled. Everybody was. I was happy to see the ball hit before [a long out to left] because it was a good approach, but then you certainly want to see somebody rewarded."	Romero allowed five runs in 4 1/3 innings with four strikeouts, eight hits and five walks.	"I felt great coming into the game," he said. "They have the offense. It's just a matter of them getting back on track."	The Red Sox have appeared to straighten out their season since losing their first six games and opening at 2-10, matching their worst 12-game record ever. Then they got three straight outstanding starting performances from Josh Beckett in a 4-1 win on Saturday and Jon Lester in an 8-1 win on Sunday.	"They really kind of baffled us today," Toronto second baseman Aaron Hill said. "It was embarrassing what happened to us the last three days."	Matsuzaka's brilliance was surprising after his bad outing on April 11 in a 16-5 loss to Tampa Bay. His ERA dropped Monday exactly in half, to 6.43. He said he simplified his approach and tried not to think too much about the advice he was getting.	"He threw a lot of strikes," Francona said. "There were a couple of points in the game where they got aggressive early in the count."	Matsuzaka left after just 89 pitches, 58 of them strikes. Alfredo Aceves pitched a scoreless eighth and Wakefield followed.	Lowrie, giving Marco Scutaro a run for the starting shortstop job, gave Boston a 2-0 lead with a two-run single in the first. The Red Sox made it 3-0 in the third on a double by Youkilis and a single by David Ortiz.	Ortiz started the fifth with a walk and scored ahead on Lowrie's home run. Youkilis added his second homer, a two-run shot, in the sixth before Crawford drove in his second run of the season. Ellsbury hit his team-leading fourth homer in the seventh.	Game notes	 U.S. Sen. Scott Brown, a left-hander, threw out the ceremonial first pitch. ... The Red Sox are 67-49 on Patriots Day. ... Lowrie struck out swinging in his last at bat in the eighth and finished 4 for 5. ... Farrell said RHP Brandon Morrow should be back on the club Friday or Saturday. Morrow, sidelined with a shoulder injury, is on a rehab assignment with Class-A Dunedin.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  David Price finally found success against the Chicago White Sox.	Price allowed four hits in eight dominant innings and the Tampa Bay Rays beat the slumping White Sox 5-0 on Monday night.	"Price was outstanding," Chicago manager Ozzie Guillen said. "They played defense behind him very well. When you're pitching that way and you make plays behind him, it's hard to beat them."	Price (2-2) struck out nine and walked two. The left-hander entered 0-4 with a 4.88 ERA in four starts against the White Sox.	"It was a big game for me. ... The White Sox have had my number ever since I've been in the big leagues," Price said. "A very tough team to pitch against, and they've got a lot of right-handed hitters that put the bat on the ball. It's tough and it's fun."	Felipe Lopez homered and drove in three runs, helping Tampa Bay win for sixth time in seven games. Ben Zobrist had a two-run homer.	Edwin Jackson (2-1) gave up four runs and 11 hits in seven innings for the White Sox, who have lost five in a row. Jackson, while with Arizona, walked eight during a 149-pitch no-hitter against Tampa Bay at Tropicana Field last June 25.	Joel Peralta pitched the ninth to complete the four-hitter.	"We know we're going to hit," Guillen said. "I don't worry about that."	Any chance of a repeat performance by Jackson ended when leadoff hitter Sam Fuld singled to start the Rays' three-run first.	After Lopez drove in Fuld with a single, Zobrist made it 3-0 on his two-run shot. Zobrist had just one hit in 13 at-bats over his previous five games.	Fuld had four hits and made a diving catch in center field during the third to take away a hit from Brent Morel. Rays shortstop Reid Brignac threw out Ramon Castro at first after making a diving stop on a second-inning grounder.	"Couldn't have done it without all the defensive plays," Price said.	Jackson worked out of a two-on, two-out jam in the second by striking out Elliot Johnson. The right-hander, who pitched for the Rays from 2006-08, had won all three previous starts against his former team, including a 5-1 victory over Price on April 7 in Chicago.	"Jackson threw the ball pretty good," Guillen said. "We just didn't score any runs."	Tampa Bay went up 4-0 on Lopez's fifth-inning double. Lopez also had a solo homer off Matt Thornton in the eighth.	Designated hitter Johnny Damon (bruised left ring finger), center fielder B.J. Upton (rest) and first baseman Dan Johnson (sore left wrist) were all out of the Rays' starting lineup.	Game notes	 Chicago RHP Jake Peavy (right shoulder) lasted just two-thirds of an inning in a rehab start with Double-A Birmingham. The White Sox said he left with discomfort -- where it was located was not disclosed -- and will be evaluated Tuesday. Peavy allowed three runs and four hits. ... Rays All-Star 3B Evan Longoria (strained left oblique) could start a minor league rehab assignment next week and return to the lineup during a series against the Los Angeles Angels that begins April 29. ... White Sox DH Adam Dunn, in a 2-for-23 slide, was not in the lineup against the left-handed Price. ... Chicago LHP Chris Sale, who grew up in nearby Lakeland, attended Tampa Bay's first game on March 31, 1998, when he was 9.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

BALTIMORE --  The Minnesota Twins finally have a winning streak to celebrate.	If all goes as planned, their modest two-game binge will ultimately provide the momentum to lift them from their unaccustomed role as cellar dwellers in the AL Central.	Francisco Liriano took a two-hitter into the seventh inning, and the Twins beat Baltimore 5-3 Monday night to extend the Orioles' losing streak to eight games.	Drew Butera had a career-high three RBIs for the Twins (6-10), who have won two in a row for the first time this season.	"Through the course of a season, you're going to have these little downs. It's how you respond back and how you play during those that makes the season," Butera said. "You're going to have it; might as well get it out of the way. Hopefully, these two wins will get us on that roll that we need to go in the right direction."	Playing in place of the injured Joe Mauer, who's on the 15-day disabled list with a leg injury, Butera hit a two-run double in the first inning and an RBI single in the ninth. He came in batting .133 with one RBI.	"It's tough to replace a guy like Joe Mauer. His bat and his presence in the lineup is definitely second to none," Butera said. "It's tough to accomplish what he does offensively, so my job is not to lose anything defensively and to win. If we win, we'll be OK."	Minnesota led 3-0 before Liriano yielded solo homers to Adam Jones and Matt Wieters in the seventh. Baltimore got two on with two outs later in the inning before Derrek Lee to hit a routine fly to center against former Oriole Jim Hoey.	The Twins made it 5-2 in the ninth off Kevin Gregg. After Butera singled in a run, Danny Valencia scored on a wild pitch.	Liriano (1-3) gave up two runs, five hits and five walks in 7 1/3 innings. The left-hander came in with a 9.42 ERA and had not pitched into the sixth inning of any of his previous three starts.	"A lot different," Liriano said of this outing. "I got better control of my fastball today and I was throwing my changeup better than my last couple starts. Location is the most important thing for me, and I think I was locating my fastball better today."	Liriano went 3-0 last April, and his effectiveness over the next few months could go a long way toward helping the Twins work their way up in the standings.	"We need Frankie," Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said. "He can be an ace for you, as he did last year for us. We need him to get on a roll and start throwing the ball well. Tonight's a really good builder for him. He can build on that."	Matt Capps worked the ninth for his second save -- the second in two games -- despite allowing a pinch-hit solo homer to Luke Scott. Capps took the closer role from Joe Nathan, who blew two save opportunities last week at Tampa Bay.	Orioles starter Chris Tillman (0-2) permitted three runs and six hits in 6 2/3 innings. It was a decent performance, but he got little offensive support.	"I was proud of the way Tillman pitched," manager Buck Showalter said. "He gave us a chance to win."	In his previous outing, a 7-4 loss to the Yankees, Tillman gave up six runs and nine hits in 1 2/3 innings. He was far better against the Twins -- even if he didn't get a victory to show for it.	"It was OK. It wasn't good enough," the right-hander said. "It's definitely a work in progress here. From the last start to this start, I've come a long way. I still have a lot of work to do."	Baltimore got runners on second and third with two outs in the first before Mark Reynolds looked at a third strike with the count full.	Butera then put the Twins ahead for good, hitting a two-run double following singles by Michael Cuddyer and Valencia.	Minnesota made it 3-0 in the third. Delmon Young hit a leadoff single, took third on a double by Cuddyer and scored on a groundout by Valencia.	Gardenhire was ejected by home plate umpire Chris Guccione for arguing a called third strike on Jason Kubel in the eighth. It was Gardenhire's 53rd career ejection.	Kubel and teammate Jim Thome each struck out three times.	Game notes	 After the game, the Twins optioned RHP Alex Burnett to Triple-A Rochester and recalled RHP Eric Hacker from the same club. ... Minnesota is 12-4 at Camden Yards since Sept. 22, 2006. ... The Orioles purchased the contract of LHP Clay Rapada, placed RHP Chris Jakubauskas (groin) on the 15-day DL and moved RHP Justin Duchscherer to the 60-day DL. Rapada pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings in his Baltimore debut. ... The Twins played without 1B Justin Morneau, who was experiencing flulike symptoms. Morneau is batting .208.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CINCINNATI -- The Pirates didn't slow down this time.	Andrew McCutchen doubled home two runs as part of Pittsburgh's biggest offensive showing this season, and the Pirates took advantage of another slow-starting Cincinnati pitcher, beating the Reds 9-3 on Monday night.	The Pirates scored three runs in the first off left-hander Travis Wood (1-2), the second game in a row that a Reds starter couldn't get going. Instead of dropping off after the fast start, the Pirates kept it up, achieving a season high in runs.	"We made 'em throw a lot of pitches," manager Clint Hurdle said. "We saw pitches, we didn't chase a whole lot. We had five two-out RBIs and a lot of two-strike hits."	Kevin Correia (3-1) gave up four hits during his second career complete game, using the big early lead to his advantage. His toughest time came at the plate in the ninth inning, when he had to bat against left-hander Aroldis Chapman so he could go for the complete game.	He worked the count full, fouling off three pitches that registered 100 mph or better before grounding back to the mound.	"He's throwing 103 and I don't know what I'm trying to do," Correia said. "After the first pitch, I moved a foot farther from the plate and started hacking."	Pittsburgh took three of four in the series, giving the defending NL Central champs their comeuppance before a crowd of 12,777 that groaned a lot. The Pirates have won their first three road series for the first time since 2002, when they dropped 89 games.	"It gives us more confidence, winning another game on the road against a team in our division," McCutchen said. "I believe it's three now, right? That's great."	Scott Rolen led off the second with a double to center and scored on a throwing error by third baseman Steve Pearce. The Reds didn't get another hit until the eighth, when Pittsburgh was in control. Chris Heisey hit a two-run homer in the ninth off Correia, who improved to 7-1 against the Reds.	The victory boosted the Pirates -- who are coming off a 105-loss campaign and have an 18-year streak of losing seasons -- to 8-8.	It was a bad day in several ways for the Reds. Starting pitcher Mike Leake got arrested for shoplifting at a downtown department store in the afternoon. He issued an apology and watched from the bench. Leake beat the Pirates 11-2 on Saturday for Cincinnati's only win of the series.	Suddenly, the defending division champs have issues with their rotation, which is missing Johnny Cueto and Homer Bailey. Both are on rehab stints in the minors, recovering from shoulder problems that forced them to start the season on the disabled list.	In the last two games, the Reds fell behind big, with Edinson Volquez and Wood getting roughed up before they could get three outs. The only question: Would it be enough?	Pittsburgh scored four in the first off Volquez on Sunday, then blew the lead and had to rally for a 7-6 win on McCutchen's RBI single in the eighth inning. The seven runs were a season high.	A day later, the Pirates jumped out quickly and kept piling on to yet another season high. They sent eight batters to the plate for a 3-0 lead against Wood, who needed 42 pitches to get through the first inning against one of the NL's lowly lineups. The Pirates came in batting .236 as a team.	"I felt fine," Wood said. "I was frustrated. You never want to throw 40 pitches in the first inning. It just wasn't my night tonight."	McCutchen's two-run double made it 5-0 in the fourth and ended Wood's outing. The left-hander was charged with eight runs on six hits in 3 1/3 innings.	At times, the Pirates didn't even have to swing to score. Matt Diaz got hit by a pitch from Matt Maloney in the fifth, forcing in a run that made it 9-1. McCutchen, Diaz and Pearce each drove in a pair of runs.	Game notes	 Pearce made his second career start at third base. ... Chapman, who got the last three games off to get over a tender elbow, worked the ninth and threw a pitch that registered 106 mph on the scoreboard but was clocked at 103 on another pitch tracker. ... The Reds put utility player Juan Francisco on the 15-day DL with a strained calf and called up OF Jeremy Hermida from Triple-A Louisville.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  C.J. Wilson is starting to feel like himself again. So are the top two hitters in the Texas Rangers' lineup.	Wilson struck out nine in seven strong innings while Ian Kinsler and Elvis Andrus both snapped out of extended slumps as the Rangers returned home with a 7-1 victory over the AL West rival Los Angeles Angels on Monday night.	"He made pitches when he had to, kept them off balance," manager Ron Washington said about Wilson, before really breaking out a smile when asked about the duo at the top of the batting order.	"They're pretty good players. We love them when they're doing well. We have to stick with them when things aren't going right," he added. "It's only April. In two or three days, those numbers you see can change pretty drastically."	Kinsler, who entered hitting .170, snapped an 0-for-18 slide with a pair of extra-base hits before scoring on a suicide squeeze by Andrus, who was hitting. 176 and in a 4-for-39 slide before his three hits.	"It was definitely a good night," Kinsler said.	Adrian Beltre homered for the second straight night and Mitch Moreland drove in three runs for the Rangers, who were back from a nine-game road trip after losing four of five. They have started a season with seven consecutive home victories for the first time.	The Angels had won five in a row with some solid pitching performances to enter the three-game series tied with Texas atop the division at 10-5. Then Ervin Santana (0-2) ran into a little bit of trouble.	Moreland's two-out, two-run single in the fourth put the Rangers ahead to stay. Texas added four runs in the fifth, including Beltre's three-run homer to straightaway center.	Kinsler started the fifth with a triple into the left-field corner that ricocheted past Vernon Wells. Andrus then bunted with Kinsler charging home and was credited with a single when Santana threw late and high to first base.	"I kind of slowed down a little bit heading into second base, saw he was having trouble with the ball and I was able to pick it back up and get into third base," Kinsler said. "Elvis is such a good bunter, he does such a good job getting the bat on the ball somehow. It makes Wash very confident to be able to put that play on and it worked well."	Michael Young followed with a single before Beltre's fifth home run of the season chased Santana.	"It was a slider and he dug down and got it," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "It wasn't that bad a pitch."	Angels pitchers allowed only 10 runs during the five-game winning streak, a span when the starters had a 1.98 ERA.	Santana struck out three and walked two while giving up 10 hits in four-plus innings. He is 11-8 in 22 career starts against the Rangers, his most against any team.	"I don't think overall he was locked in, but he wasn't far off," Scioscia said. "Those guys beat us today. We didn't execute some things on the mound and at the plate, but we're not that far off."	Wilson (2-0) was already over 100 pitches when he gave up three consecutive two-out singles in the seventh, the last to Howie Kendrick for the Angels' only run. The crafty left-hander got a rousing ovation from the crowd when walking to the dugout after he got Bobby Abreu on an inning-ending flyball.	Wilson scattered nine hits. His only walk was to Abreu in the first before Torii Hunter grounded into a double play.	"I felt a little bit more myself. I still don't feel like I'm all the way back to where I want to be yet," Wilson said. "I ended up throwing a ton of pitches. ... I was getting ahead of a lot of guys, but not able to put away everybody."	Game notes	 Beltre has four homers in his nine-game hitting streak. He also had his fourth game this season with at least three RBIs. ... Kinsler got his first hit in a week with a two-out double in the third. He was thrown out trying to score on a single by Andrus. ... Hunter was in a 2-for-30 slide before a bloop single in the eighth that popped out of the glove of a leaping Kinsler at 2B. ... Rangers C Mike Napoli, who had been in the Angels' organization the past 11 years since they drafted him in 2000, played his first game against them. He was 1 for 3 with a bloop double on a checked swing. ... Angels INF Erick Aybar, out since April 3 because of a left oblique strain, is expected to rejoin the team for the series finale Wednesday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO --  With a first-pitch temperature barely above freezing, Monday was the kind of night Chicago Cubs catcher Geovany Soto could do without.	Good thing for him it ended on a high note -- even if it took an extra inning.	Pinch-hitter Tyler Colvin doubled home Soto with two outs in the 10th inning to lift the Chicago Cubs to a 1-0 win over the San Diego Padres on Monday night.	Soto reached on a fielder's choice with two outs, then scored from first when Colvin lined a shot to right. The Cubs had an abbreviated celebration at home before bolting for the clubhouse for cover.	"The whole game you go out there and you're kind of miserable and it's so cold," Soto said. "We wanted to get out of there so badly. We were like, 'Man, all we need is one.' But it was tough to get that one."	Carlos Marmol (1-1) struck out two in 1 1/3 scoreless innings to pick up the win for the Cubs.	Chad Qualls (0-1) allowed a run while getting two outs for San Diego.	Tim Stauffer scattered four hits in seven scoreless innings, striking out four and walking one. He lowered his ERA from 4.80 to 3.27 before being replaced by pinch-hitter Brad Hawpe in the eighth after throwing just 95 pitches.	"I felt pretty good still," Stauffer said. "I felt like I had another one in me; it's just a matter of my spot coming up in the order. I felt just as good late in the game as at any other point.	Wearing no sleeves, Carlos Zambrano one-upped Stauffer, allowing three hits in eight scoreless innings for Chicago. He struck out 10 and walked one.	Zambrano struck out the side in the first, then got stronger as the game went on. He retired the last 13 batters he faced, lowering his ERA from 6.11 to 4.21.	Zambrano, who hasn't lost since being put on the suspended list for a dugout tirade during a loss to the White Sox on June 25, faced his only real trouble in the second.	He struck out Nick Hundley to lead off the inning before allowing a single to Ryan Ludwick. Cameron Maybin then reached base on a fielder's choice, and Jason Bartlett's single advanced Maybin to third.	But Zambrano stranded both runners by getting Stauffer to ground out to shortstop.	Zambrano allowed just one more hit a fourth-inning single by Hundley.	"Big Z has been here for almost 10 years so he can handle [the weather]," Soto said. "Plus seeing him pitch with no sleeves, I was even colder. But he's a veteran so he knows what to do and he brought it."	San Diego's 3-4-5 hitters -- Orlando Hudson, Jorge Cantu and Hundley -- went a combined 1 for 11 with eight strikeouts. Bartlett, who entered the game batting .167, led the Padres with two hits.	"It's Chicago. It's the windy city. It's a great place to play in the summertime," Hudson said. "But it's not summertime."	Chicago's 3-4-5 hitters -- Marlon Byrd, Aramis Ramirez and Carlos Pena -- also went a combined 1-for-11. The trio's only hit was a bunt single by Pena.	Pena just missed winning it with a left-field shot in the ninth, but the wind kept him from his first homer in a Cubs uniform.	"He crushed that ball," Cubs manager Mike Quade said. "Well guess what, maybe a bunt single is the way to go sometimes. On nights like this when we're scrapping for a run, why not?	Game notes	 It was the first night game at Wrigley Field in 2011. ... Chicago right-handed pitchers Randy Wells and Andrew Cashner were scheduled to be evaluated by the team orthopedic specialist Monday night. Both have been on the DL since April 8 -- Wells with a strained forearm and Cashner with a rotator cuff strain. ... Padres OF Chris Denorfia pinch-hit a day after exiting San Diego's 8-6 win over Houston in the fourth inning with a bruised left forearm suffered during a collision with the right-field wall. ... LHP Joe Thatcher, who's spent the early season on the DL with a shoulder injury, played catch Monday. San Diego manager Bud Black said Thatcher felt fine but isn't ready to throw off a mound yet.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Round one in the showdown between unlikely AL Central leaders went to Cleveland.	Pinch-hitter Shelley Duncan's RBI double sparked a four-run 10th inning and the Indians beat Kansas City 7-3 on Monday night to widen their division lead to two games over the equally surprising Royals.	Duncan batted for Travis Buck after Carlos Santana drew a walk from rookie left-hander Tim Collins (1-1) to start the 10th. Duncan hooked an RBI double into the left-field corner, driving home the tiebreaking run in Cleveland's fourth straight win.	"He hits lefties," Indians manager Manny Acta said. "He's our best option against lefties. He's proven that over the years."	In perhaps the most encouraging sign for the Indians, Grady Sizemore, in his second game back from knee surgery, added an RBI single and was 3 for 5 after going 2 for 4 on Sunday in his first game since May 16, 2010.	"The reason I came over here was to enjoy this guy from the dugout after seeing him over the last seven-eight years," Acta said. "It's nice to have him back."	Collins, one of three rookie relievers who have played a big part in Kansas City's strong start, gave up four hits and four runs in one inning.	"Real bad," he said. "It's always a rough night when you go out and give up four runs. I wasn't making my pitches. I wasn't in the strike zone. When I did get it in the strike zone, they hit it."	Joe Smith (1-0) got the victory with 1 1/3 innings of hitless relief.	Expected by most observers to remain also-rans in the AL Central this year, the Indians and Royals had not been first and second this late in the season in any order since May 31, 1999, when Cleveland led the Royals and White Sox by 10 games en route to a fifth straight division title. That also was the last time the Indians started a season as well as they've started this one, winning 12 of their first 16.	One out after Duncan's double, Michael Brantley walked. Matt LaPorta grounded into a fielder's choice and pinch-runner Adam Everett scored on shortstop Alcides Escobar's throwing error. Jack Hannahan followed with an RBI double and Sizemore made it 7-3 with his third hit.	"We didn't help ourselves, that's for sure," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "We really struggled to command the ball, especially out of the 'pen. Leadoff walks and the 10th inning hurt us."	The Royals scored twice to take a 3-2 lead in the sixth on Melky Cabrera's RBI double and an RBI single by Alex Gordon, who tied his career high with a 12-game hitting streak, the longest in the majors this year.	Billy Butler's single made it four straight hits off starter Carlos Carrasco and put runners at first and second. But the right-hander escaped further damage by retiring Kila Ka'aihue on a foul pop and coaxing a double-play grounder out of Jeff Francoeur.	Royals starter Kyle Davies was charged with two runs and seven hits in six innings. He struck out seven, walked none and was relieved by Jeremy Jeffress, who walked Brantley on four pitches to start the seventh and then threw wildly to first on a pickoff attempt, allowing the runner to move up two bases.	LaPorta, after hitting an RBI single that tied it 3-all, went to second on Jeffress' wild pitch. With one out, Jeffress walked Sizemore and Asdrubal Cabrera and handed a bases-loaded jam to reliever Aaron Crow, who struck out Shin-Soo Choo and retired Santana on a pop fly.	"On a positive note, Kyle Davies pitched great -- six strong innings," Yost said. "Aaron Crow did a phenomenal job with the bases loaded."	Santana had an RBI double in the first and Cleveland took a 2-1 lead in the third on Choo's sacrifice fly.	Wilson Betemit had a sacrifice fly in the second for the Royals and singled leading off the seventh, tying his career best with a 10-game hitting streak.	Game notes	 It was Butler's 25th birthday. ... The two AL Central leaders will play each other seven times in 11 days, including a three-game series next week in Cleveland. ... Carrasco's first major league win was against the Royals last Sept. 17. He pitched 6 1/3 innings and gave up three runs on seven hits. ... Gordon also had a 12-game hitting streak in 2008. ... The Royals failed to score in the eighth despite two Cleveland errors.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

DENVER --  Tim Lincecum and the San Francisco Giants sure weren't complaining about the humidor Monday night.	"Not at all," said Lincecum, the two-time Cy Young Award winner who took a no-hitter into the seventh inning at Coors Field in San Francisco's 8-1 rout of the Colorado Rockies.	Spotted an early eight-run cushion thanks to homers by Pat Burrell, Nate Schierholtz and Freddy Sanchez, Lincecum (2-1) cruised through Colorado's lineup, dominating baseball's best team over the season's first 2 1/2 weeks until Carlos Gonzalez broke up his no-hit bid with a clean single in the seventh.	"I wasn't really thinking about it," Lincecum said of his no-hit bid.	His teammates certainly were.	Burrell said he went to manager Bruce Bochy and begged to be taken out, figuring he was a defensive liability in left field late in the game.	"I went in and talked to Bochy and said, 'Listen, I'd hate to be the guy that doesn't get to a ball that somebody else might catch,' " said Burrell, who was replaced by Darren Ford in the middle of the seventh.	Lincecum didn't allow a ball to the outfield until Jonathan Herrera led off the seventh with a fly to deep right. By then, the ball wasn't carrying and it settled into Schierholtz's glove.	Gonzalez followed with the first hit of the night off Lincecum, and he scored on Todd Helton's two-out double.	Lincecum was shooting for the 14th no-hitter in franchise history and the first since Jonathan Sanchez handcuffed the San Diego Padres on July 10, 2009, which snapped a 32-year Giants drought.	The only no-hitter at Coors Field was thrown by Hideo Nomo of the Los Angeles Dodgers on Sept. 17, 1996.	Lincecum benefited from some nice defensive plays by second baseman Sanchez, including a diving stop of Gonzalez's hard grounder in the first on a 2-0 changeup -- the exact pitch Gonzalez would be sitting on six innings later.	Lincecum said he had no regrets about the 3-1 changeup that Gonzalez raked to right, however.	"No, that's what I wanted to throw right there," he said. "I felt like I threw the pitch that I wanted and you tip your cap to him. He hit it well."	Gonzalez was the one complimenting his opponent.	"Well, the guy was dealing today," Gonzalez said. "That's why the guy has two Cy Young Awards. Whenever you have to face a guy like that you want to count on your starting pitcher" because runs are going to be hard to come by.	The Rockies entered the night with a 12-3 mark and a four-game lead over San Francisco in the NL West, but right-hander Esmil Rogers (2-1) didn't have it, allowing eight runs and six hits over three innings in just the second loss by a Rockies starter this season.	Lincecum allowed one run and three hits over 7 2/3 spectacular innings. He walked three, struck out 10 and allowed just four balls out of the infield, none in the first six innings.	"He's always good, but tonight was some of his best stuff that I've seen," Troy Tulowitzki said. "And then he was getting up there 95 [mph] after CarGo got that hit. It seemed like he amped it up a little bit. He's special."	Ryan Vogelsong got the final four outs for San Francisco.	This was the first visit to Coors Field by the Giants since they made a stink about the humidor protocol prior to a key series last September -- before the Rockies faded from the playoff race and the Giants went on to win their first championship since moving West in 1958.	Last fall, MLB changed the humidor protocol one day after Lincecum was caught on camera uttering expletives after being given a new ball, suggesting it was a "juiced ball."	The Rockies insist they hold no grudges. The rivalry is spicy enough without any humidor hyperbole.	"I know a couple of their guys pretty good, including Lincecum," Tulowitzki said. "We think it's pretty comical."	The Rockies found nothing to laugh about Monday night, when the Giants spotted Lincecum a five-run lead in the first inning as Burrell (his fifth) and Schierholtz (his first) hit back-to-back homers.	Schierholtz followed Burrell's three-run homer with a shot to the upper deck in right.	"After that, it's real tough to respond," Tulowitzki said.	Clayton Mortensen, recalled from Triple-A Colorado Springs before the game, replaced Rogers to start the fourth and allowed two hits with two walks and a strikeout, saving the Rockies' bullpen.	Game notes	 Rockies ace Ubaldo Jimenez (cut thumb cuticle) comes off the 15-day disabled list to start the second game of the series Tuesday night against Sanchez. ... OF Cody Ross (right calf) might rejoin the Giants on Tuesday from a rehab assignment with Triple-A Fresno.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

SEATTLE --  Victor Martinez hopes he needs just a few days to rest his sore groin.	Detroit manager Jim Leyland is already thinking the Tigers might be without their new slugger for longer.	"If I just need three days I'll be happy, but it's pretty sore right now," Martinez said. "I don't know. I'll just take it day by day and see what happens."	Brandon Inge scored the go-ahead run on a wild pitch from Seattle Mariners reliever Josh Lueke in the seventh inning, Jhonny Peralta added a bases-loaded triple and the Tigers rallied late for an 8-3 victory Monday night.	Max Scherzer remained unbeaten and Detroit scored six times in the seventh, sending 10 batters to the plate while capitalizing on another bullpen meltdown by the Mariners.	But the bigger concern was the status of Martinez, who left in the second inning with a strained right groin after he singled to right field. Martinez tweaked his groin in his final at-bat Saturday night against Oakland, then sat out Sunday as a precaution.	On Monday night, Martinez was noticeably uncomfortable as he jogged down to first base. He said it started to bother him earlier in the at-bat, but by the time Martinez advanced to second on Brennan Boesch's RBI single, Leyland had seen enough and pulled Martinez, who walked slowly back to the dugout.	He's expected to undergo further examination Tuesday. Leyland said he needed to talk with general manager Dave Dombrowski before deciding what the next move would be.	"I'm sure we're going to have to do something," Leyland said.	Martinez wasn't needed in the Tigers' seventh inning when Seattle's bullpen struggled.	Inge led off with a single to left, went to second on a sacrifice bunt and moved to third on Ryan Raburn's single. Lueke (1-1) then dumped a slider in the dirt that catcher Miguel Olivo couldn't keep from going to the backstop, allowing Inge to score.	Miguel Cabrera singled on a 3-0 pitch for a two-run lead, then Chris Ray took over and fared no better. Ray walked Casper Wells and saw pinch-runner Ramon Santiago score on yet another wild pitch that Olivo couldn't backhand.	After Boesch was intentionally walked to load the bases, Peralta cracked a drive to center field that Ryan Langerhans couldn't catch up with. The inning finally ended when Ray struck out Alex Avila and got a popout from Inge.	Lueke and Ray combined to throw 44 pitches in the seventh, tossing just 16 strikes, allowing four hits, three walks and two wild pitches.	"That seventh inning got ugly there," Seattle manager Eric Wedge said. "Lueke and Ray just didn't have it today. They got behind and then came in and that is where it got away from us."	Cabrera also showed he's still got some wheels, scoring from first base on Boesch's double into the left-field corner in the sixth. Cabrera was waved home after Seattle left fielder Milton Bradley misplayed the ball.	Scherzer (3-0) nearly matched his previous two outings by going six innings and giving up two runs. He walked four and struck out seven, but Leyland would have liked to see Scherzer be more efficient with his pitches early and be able to go another inning or two.	"A guy like Max should get you into the seventh or eighth inning all the time," Leyland said.	Scherzer's only mistake was a two-run homer by Bradley in the third, a 2-1 pitch that Bradley drove to right-center. The right-hander also benefited from Seattle's own ineptitude in the fifth, when the Mariners failed to score after putting two on with no outs.	Game notes	 Raburn hit a foul ball in the first inning that glanced off a large beam holding up the Safeco Field roof above the third-base dugout. It's the first ball in the almost 12-year-history of the stadium to hit any part of the retractable roof. ... Olivo got his first hit at Safeco Field this season in the sixth inning, snapping an 0-for-18 skid. ... Justin Smoak homered leading off the eighth for Seattle, his second of the season.

LOS ANGELES --  The Dodgers' starting rotation has been doing a superb job of setting the tone in the first inning. Tim Hudson has been having great difficulty keeping opponents off the scoreboard early.	Those two trends continued on Monday night, as Ted Lilly pitched seven scoreless innings and James Loney had two RBIs off Hudson during a three-run first that propelled Los Angeles to a 4-2 victory over the Atlanta Braves.	"It's always nice to get early runs, especially when it's against a quality pitcher like Hudson," Lilly said. "When you have a chance to jump ahead like that, you have to take advantage."	Lilly (1-2) recorded his first victory of the season in four starts, after signing a three-year, $33 million contract in October. The 35-year-old left-hander scattered four hits, struck out six and did not allow a runner past second base.	"I was able to locate my fastball. For me, that's the key to all my other pitches being effective," Lilly said. "Since the San Francisco game [a 4-3 loss], I've made some adjustments mechanically which have allowed me to repeat pitches more consistently."	Dodgers pitchers have given up only three first-inning runs through their first 17 games. Last season, the staff allowed 98, the most they yielded in any inning.	Hudson (2-2) gave up four runs and six hits in six innings and struck out four. All 13 runs allowed this season by the right-hander have come during the first three innings. In his previous start against the Dodgers on Aug. 13 in Atlanta, Hudson held them to three hits over eight innings in a 1-0 victory.	"I felt like I should have shut them down in the first inning, to be honest," Hudson said. "I felt really good. I felt like I had good stuff and that I was locating pretty good. But they put together some good at-bats and found a way to push some runs across."	Matt Guerrier pitched a perfect eighth and Jonathan Broxton gave up two runs in the ninth on an RBI groundout by Freddie Freeman and a double by Nate McLouth before getting the final out.	Andre Ethier singled in the seventh against Jairo Asencio to extend his hitting streak to 15 games, the longest current streak in the majors and one shy of his career best in 2006. He was hitless in three at-bats against Hudson, and is 3 for 20 lifetime against the three-time All-Star.	The Braves and Dodgers met for the first time since the offseason retirements of managers Bobby Cox and Joe Torre, who are fourth and fifth respectively on the career victory list and won a combined six manager of the year awards, five World Series titles and 11 pennants.	Matt Kemp, who gave the Dodgers a 2-1 victory over St. Louis on Sunday with a two-run homer in the ninth, opened the scoring against Hudson with an RBI single in the first. Loney added a two-run single two batters later, after entering the game batting .150.	Jerry Sands, the Dodgers' minor league player of the year last season, made his major league debut in left field and was 1 for 4 with a sacrifice fly and two strikeouts. The 23-year-old outfielder-first baseman batted .400 with five homers and 17 RBIs in 10 games before his contract was purchased from Triple-A Albuquerque. He was a 25th-round draft pick in 2008 out of Catawba College in Salisbury, N.C.	Sands hit an opposite-field double to right his first time up and heard it from the crowd of 28,292 -- whose cheers quickly turned to moans when Loney was held up at third base by coach Tim Wallach.	The next time Sands came to the plate in the third, he was greeted with chants of Jer-ry! Jer-ry!" before driving in Juan Uribe with his sac fly to right for the Dodgers' final run. Those same chants started up again when Sands came up in the sixth, and Hudson buzzed him with a first-pitch fastball that made him duck.	"He signed a ball and sent it over. It was a classy move by him and I appreciate that," Sands said. "He said 'Good debut' and told me it got away from him a little bit. But I wasn't looking into it at all. I watched him growing up, so that'll definitely go in the trophy case."	Lilly sent the Braves a message in the seventh when he threw a pitch behind McLouth and to the screen with two outs and the bases empty. Both dugouts received a warning from plate umpire Laz Diaz, and McLouth doubled on the next pitch.	"I think that's just old school. The warnings were out, no big deal," Atlanta manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "I don't think anything else will happen the rest of the series. Lilly did what he had to do, and that's it. Go out and play baseball."	Brooks Conrad then batted for Hudson and took a called third strike, ending the seventh and stranding McLouth. Atlanta's pinch-hitters are 0 for 25, including a game-ending strikeout by Eric Hinske while batting for Asencio.	Game notes	 Kemp leads the majors with a .459 average and has 13 RBIs in his first 17 games. ... Hudson and Lilly were teammates in Oakland for half of 2002 and all of 2003.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Tampa Bay manager Joe Maddon could sense early on that James Shields was heading for a big game.	Shields struck out nine in a four-hitter and the surging Rays beat the Chicago White Sox 2-1 on Tuesday night for their seventh win in eight games.	"It was really fun to watch," Maddon said. "He kept his tempo. He kept his pace. The quality of the locations was severe. On the money all night long. I could tell he was on right from jump street."	Shields (1-1) outpitched John Danks and walked one in his sixth career complete game, and first since June 10, 2008, against the Los Angeles Angels.	"I wanted it, that's for sure," Shields said. "Joe had some faith in me. I was cruising through the game. It's exciting. I got the CG. It's been a long time."	It was the second straight outstanding pitching performance for Tampa Bay. David Price and Joel Peralta combined on a four-hitter in a 5-0 win over the White Sox on Monday night.	Danks (0-2) gave up two runs and seven hits in seven innings for the White Sox, who have lost six in a row. The left-hander struck out five and hit two batters.	"It's a shame when you're wasting good pitching," Chicago manager Ozzie Guillen said.	Danks held the Rays without a hit in six at-bats -- including a pair of strikeouts by B.J. Upton -- with runners in scoring position through three innings, and 0-for-8 overall.	The White Sox, who have scored just 29 runs over the last 10 games, tied it at 1 in the fifth. Carlos Quentin hit a leadoff double and scored on A.J. Pierzynski's one-out single to center.	"It's a combination of both," Guillen said. "Shields pitched very well and we're not swinging the bat well. We're struggling right now at the plate, big time."	The Rays went back in front in the bottom half of the fifth on Sean Rodriguez's run-scoring triple.	Shields got some defensive help in the seventh from catcher Kelly Shoppach, who picked Paul Konerko off at first after Quentin struck out.	Chicago designated hitter Adam Dunn went 0-for-4, including three strikeouts. He has two hits in his last 27 at-bats.	Guillen said he might drop Dunn, who missed six games after having an emergency appendectomy on April 6, down in the lineup from his current third spot.	"Just so he can relax," Guillen said. "When you're out for a few days, it takes you a little while to come back and regroup."	Shields ended the game by striking out Dunn and Konerko with Juan Pierre on second.	"It's awesome," Maddon said. "He was very confident the last three innings."	Tampa Bay grabbed the lead in the first when Ben Zobrist tripled and scored on a grounder by Felipe Lopez, who had three RBIs in Monday's game. Zobrist entered hitless in 10 at-bats against Danks.	Designated hitter Johnny Damon (bruised left ring finger tip) and first baseman Dan Johnson (sore left forearm-wrist) were out of the Rays' lineup. Both could start again in the next couple days.	Game notes	 Tampa Bay LF Sam Fuld, the replacement for All-Star Carl Crawford, received high praise from Maddon. "There's no drop off," Maddon said. "Sam's playing that level of defense right now. All the different things he's doing defensively, I can't say that Carl's better." Crawford signed with Boston during the offseason. ... Danks didn't allow a run in the first three innings of his other three starts this season. ... Tampa Bay LHP J.P. Howell, coming back from left shoulder surgery, is set to pitch in extended spring training after throwing a 35-pitch batting practice session. The reliever is not expected to rejoin the team until mid-May.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BALTIMORE --  As the losses continued to mount, the Baltimore Orioles kept believing the next night would be the one in which they broke out of their miserable skid.	When it finally happened, the fashion in which the Orioles ended their eight-game losing streak was nothing short of spectacular.	Matt Wieters had four RBIs, Vladimir Guerrero homered, and Baltimore scored all its runs with two outs in an 11-0 rout of the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday.	Jake Arrieta (2-1) pitched six innings of four-hit ball for the Orioles, who built an 8-0 lead in the fifth inning and coasted to their first win in 10 days after a 6-1 start. The 11 runs and 13 hits were season highs.	"You go through things like this with real good clubs and with bad clubs," manager Buck Showalter said of the losing streak. "This one had a different feel to it for me, and I still feel that way. There was a real confident [mentality]. The frustration was due to knowing they were capable of doing better."	Twins starter Carl Pavano (1-2) gave up seven earned runs and eight hits in 4 2/3 innings. The right-hander had allowed only one run in his previous 16 innings.	"It was just one of those days. My ball seemed pretty flat. It didn't have much movement," Pavano said. "It was a battle all night. I didn't have great stuff coming out of the pen and never got into any rhythm."	And the Orioles knew it.	"We know what Pavano's got -- he's a pitcher that pitches," said Adam Jones, who had two hits and scored twice. "We just got him out of his rhythm and were able to scrape away some runs with two outs. That's big."	As the hip-hop music blared in the clubhouse, Jones and the Orioles looked ahead to better times.	"We've got a winning streak of one right now," he said. "When was that eight-game losing streak? It's out of my mind."	Wieters delivered an RBI single in the third inning, a three-run double in the fifth and scored a career-high three runs.	Guerrero's second homer of the season, an opposite-field shot to right, came with two on in the eighth inning on a 3-1 pitch from struggling reliever Joe Nathan.	Arrieta walked three, struck out four and lowered his ERA from 7.04 to 5.06. It was the second time in 22 career starts that he did not allow a run.	"I struggled tonight with some things but made some pitches in big situations and was able to get out of some jams," he said.	The right-hander was facing a last-place Minnesota team that ranked 30th in the majors in runs. The loss ended the Twins' first winning streak of the season at two.	Minnesota was without Delmon Young and Justin Morneau, both of whom have been experiencing flulike symptoms. Morneau has sat out three straight games and Young, who also has a sore rib cage, missed his first game of the year.	Plus, Joe Mauer is on the disabled list, which left manager Ron Gardenhire with very few options.	"Right now, the challenge is getting my lineup out there, to get my guys back on the field," Gardenhire said. "We've got a few too many holes out there. We need our boys to get back on the field. Whether we're going to be able to do that [Wednesday], I'm not positive."	Baltimore scored three runs in the second after Pavano got two quick outs. Jones started the uprising with an infield hit, Mark Reynolds walked on four pitches and Wieters delivered an RBI single. Then, after Robert Andino walked to load the bases, Brian Roberts bounced a two-run single up the middle.	The Orioles struck again in the fourth after Pavano retired the first two batters. Wieters was hit by a pitch and Andino singled before Roberts doubled in a run for a 4-0 lead.	Baltimore pulled away with a four-run fifth. After two singles and a walk loaded the bases with two outs, Wieters worked the count full before hitting a double off the right-field scoreboard. After Pavano was pulled, Wieters scored on a throwing error by shortstop Alexi Casilla.	Game notes	 Wieters is 5 for 5 with eight RBIs this season with runners in scoring position. ... Young's absence means Danny Valencia and Jason Kubel are the only Twins to play in every game. ... Baltimore's Nick Markakis went 0 for 4 and has only one hit in his last 20 at-bats. ... Andino had three hits for his third straight multihit game.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

PHILADELPHIA --  Back in the ballpark where he used to be an ace, Randy Wolf shut down his former team and outpitched the reigning NL Cy Young Award winner.	Wolf tossed six crisp innings, Ryan Braun and Casey McGehee homered and the Milwaukee Brewers beat Roy Halladay and the Philadelphia Phillies 9-0 Tuesday night.	The Brewers became the first team to win a series against the NL East-leading Phillies this season. They'll try to complete a three-game sweep on Wednesday afternoon when Cliff Lee takes the mound for Philadelphia.	Wolf (2-2) allowed two hits, struck out five and walked three against his former team. The left-hander had his best seasons with Philadelphia in the early 2000s, and was an All-Star in '03.	"It was tough early on. I didn't have my best stuff," Wolf said. "I tried to mix speeds a lot and I think I kept them off balance."	Jimmy Rollins had a bunt single in the first and Shane Victorino hit a double in the third for the Phillies' only hits of the game.	Sean Green, Zach Braddock and Michael McClendon each pitched an inning after Wolf left.	"I had really good defense behind me," Wolf said. "They're a dangerous team. You don't want to let them get something going."	Halladay (2-1) gave up six runs and 10 hits in 6 2/3 innings. It was his worst start since he allowed six runs in six innings in a loss at the New York Yankees last June 15.	Halladay tossed a complete game at Washington last Wednesday, needing 123 pitches to do it. He got an extra day of rest because of a rainout, but still wasn't as sharp as usual.	"I felt good. There were times early when there were a couple pitches that cost me that weren't where I wanted them," Halladay said.	Halladay retired the first two batters in the second before running into trouble against the bottom of the lineup. Yuniesky Betancourt doubled to deep right-center. With the pitcher on deck, Halladay fell behind in the count 3-1 to George Kottaras before grooving a fastball. Kottaras ripped an RBI single to right for a 1-0 lead.	The Brewers got another two-out run in the third when Braun hit an opposite-field shot to right.	Braun then made an outstanding play in the bottom half to rob Rollins of extra bases and save at least one run. With runners on first and second, Rollins hit a drive to deep left. Braun made a leaping, backhanded grab at the warning track after a long run.	"We were gonna score some runs there," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said. "He made a tremendous catch."	Braun got things started in the sixth with a walk. He moved to second on Prince Fielder's single and scored on Mark Kotsay's one-out single.	Fielder chased Halladay with an RBI single that extended Milwaukee's lead to 4-0. David Herndon entered and allowed McGehee's three-run shot.	"He's the best pitcher in baseball and we put together some good at-bats against him," Braun said of Halladay. "You don't want to get behind. You try to be patient, but not overly patient."	Game notes	 The Brewers have four shutouts among their nine wins. ... A crowd of 45,408 was the 146th consecutive sellout at Citizens Bank Park, including postseason play. ... The Phillies placed LHP J.C. Romero on the 15-day disabled list because of a strained right calf. Lefty Mike Zagurski was recalled from Triple-A Lehigh Valley. ... Brewers CF Carlos Gomez robbed Carlos Ruiz of extra bases in the second with a running catch on a drive to deep right-center. ...

TORONTO --  The New York Yankees are never more comfortable than when they hand a lead to Mariano Rivera. But even the best closer in baseball has the occasional off night.	Toronto scored twice off Rivera in the ninth before Blue Jays outfielder Travis Snider doubled home the winning run in the 10th, beating the Yankees 6-5 on Tuesday night.	"That's all the inspiration we need as players is to see what we did in the ninth inning against Mariano," Snider said. "To be able to give ourselves a chance, to go out there and just have that shot, I'm very thankful for it."	Rivera suffered his first blown save in eight chances before Toronto won it against Ivan Nova (1-2).	"We got it to where we wanted to and we just didn't hold onto it," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.	Edwin Encarnacion opened the 10th with a single. After Jayson Nix and Yunel Escobar flied out, Snider drove a double to right-center, scoring Encarnacion with the winning run. Snider, who went 1 for 6, tossed his helmet away in celebration as the winning run scored.	Jon Rauch (1-1) pitched one inning for the win as Toronto snapped a three-game losing streak and won for the first time this season when trailing after eight innings.	Jose Bautista hit a solo home run for the Blue Jays, his fourth.	Mark Teixeira hit a two-run shot and Curtis Granderson added a solo drive for the Yankees, who lead the majors with 29 home runs.	Toronto trailed 5-3 to begin the ninth against Rivera, who hadn't allowed a run in 19 consecutive April appearances.	"Going in there I had it in mind that everything was going to be fine," Rivera said. "Today wasn't a good day."	Escobar led off with a double to center, took third on a grounder and scored on a wild pitch that was also ball four to Bautista.	"I held the ball too long," Rivera said. "I wanted to go away and it was way too away and ended up being a wild pitch. I was upset with that one."	Adam Lind followed with a single, putting runners on the corners for John McDonald, who drove in the tying run with a squeeze bunt up the first base line. Teixeira charged the ball and flipped to catcher Russell Martin, but too late to get the sliding Bautista.	"It's just a great play," Teixeira said. "That's why you run it because when it's run well, it's almost impossible to defend. I thought there might have been a chance to get him so I gave it a quick flip but it was a good play."	Jose Molina followed with a single, loading the bases for Corey Patterson, who grounded into a double play.	The rally snapped Rivera's streak of 17 1/3 scoreless innings in April, a run that stretched back to April 30, 2009.	"That's the thing about Mo, he's not perfect but he's close to it," Teixeira said.	Bautista got the Blue Jays started with a solo homer off Burnett in the first, his fourth, but the Yankees answered with a two-run second.	Nick Swisher and Eric Chavez opened the inning with walks, Jorge Posada hit an RBI single and a second run scored on Martin's double play grounder.	Toronto tied it in the third, taking advantage of a throwing error by A.J. Burnett. Bautista drew a one-out walk, took second on a wild pitch, then escaped from a rundown and advanced to third after Jeter couldn't handle Burnett's throw on Lind's comebacker to the mound. Aaron Hill followed with a sacrifice fly.	"I just got rid of it too early," Burnett said of his errant throw. "I could have run him all the way back to second, looking back on it."	After Granderson singled to open the sixth, Teixeira followed with a drive to center.	Toronto clawed one back in the bottom half. Hill singled and stole second but had to leave with tightness in his right hamstring, with John McDonald coming on to run. Jose Molina flied out and Corey Patterson walked before Encarnacion hit an RBI double.	Burnett left after walking Nix to load the bases, but Robertson fanned Escobar and Snider to escape the jam. A frustrated Snider broke his bat over his thigh, then slammed the pieces into the dirt after going down swinging to end the inning.	Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez was held out of the starting lineup for the second straight game because of a sore left side. Rodriguez said he expects to return Wednesday.	Game notes	 New York also leads the majors in multihomer games (10). ... Toronto activated RHP Frank Francisco (right shoulder) off the 15-day DL and optioned RHP Jesse Litsch to Triple-A Las Vegas. ... Yankees RHP Carlos Silva threw 40 pitches during his second bullpen session at New York's spring training complex in Tampa and could face hitters early next week. Silva, released by the Chicago Cubs in spring training, signed a minor league deal with New York on April 9. ... Yankees C Francisco Cervelli, coming back from a broken left foot, caught Silva. Cervelli is playing in extended spring training games.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

CINCINNATI --  Good thing for the Diamondbacks that Melvin Mora had a sore foot.	Ryan Roberts was a late addition to the starting lineup because of Mora's injury and hit two of Arizona's four homers off Sam LeCure, leading the Diamondbacks to a 5-4 victory over the slumping Cincinnati Reds on Tuesday night.	"It was one of those days where everything you hit seems to go," Roberts said. "I don't know how to explain it. It's a good thing I got in there tonight."	Roberts hit a solo drive and a two-run homer for his second career multihomer game. Kelly Johnson and Chris Young also connected against LeCure (0-1), helping the Diamondbacks pile up a season high in homers.	Armando Galarraga went six innings, matching the best start of his career at 3-0. J.J. Putz pitched the ninth for his fourth save in four chances, fanning Chris Heisey with a runner on second to end it. Putz opened the inning by hitting Jonny Gomes, putting himself in trouble.	"That's the one thing you never want to do, walk or hit a guy in a one-run game in the ninth inning," Putz said. "We were fortunate to get out of this one. Today was definitely a nerve-racking game for me."	The last week hasn't been so good for the Reds, who have dropped five of six. The defending NL Central champions are only one game over .500 (9-8) for the first time since they beat Milwaukee on Opening Day.	For the third game in a row, a Reds starter gave up at least five runs. LeCure lasted only 5 1/3 innings and gave up nine hits, including the career-high four homers. It was the most homers allowed by the Reds in a game this season.	A sore foot unexpectedly played a role.	Mora jammed his left foot while running the bases Sunday during a 6-5, 12-inning win over San Francisco. He tested it before Tuesday's game and felt some soreness, so manager Kirk Gibson made the lineup change as a precaution.	Turned out to be a fortunate break.	Roberts hit a solo homer in the first and a two-run shot in the fifth, when Arizona squandered a chance to pull away. The Diamondbacks had a single, a double, a triple and Roberts' homer in the inning, but managed only two runs.	Galarraga had a lot to do with it.	Juan Miranda opened the fifth with a double and Galarraga tried to sacrifice, but his bunt went right to LeCure, who was able to get the out at third. When Johnson followed with a single, Galarraga rounded second base too far and was caught in a rundown.	Roberts homered into the first row of seats in left field for a 4-3 lead. Justin Upton followed with a fly that deflected off the top of the wall in right field and came back, leaving him with a triple. The umpires reviewed the play and confirmed the call.	"I was trying to keep it down because if they got it up in the air, you just weren't sure," said LeCure, who hadn't given up a homer this season. "Every ball hit in the air I was scared about. Some of the balls they hit were down."	Galarraga did better on the mound than on the bases, giving up three runs, including Drew Stubbs' solo homer. Gibson wasn't happy with where he threw his pitches early and considered replacing him.	"The first three innings, he wasn't executing what we wanted him to do and we almost took him out," Gibson said. "He made the adjustment and threw the ball where he was supposed to throw it."	Galarraga got a better feel for his slider after the third inning.	"I got behind the ball more and the ball was moving," Galarraga said. "I got better results."	Brandon Phillips singled home a run off David Hernandez in the eighth.	Game notes	 Roberts' other multihomer game was Aug. 4, 2009, at Pittsburgh. ... Galarraga also won his first three decisions in 2009. ... Umpires took 2 minutes, 39 seconds to review Upton's triple in the fifth and uphold the call. Upton contended the ball had cleared the wall and bounced back. ... Putz is the first Diamondbacks pitcher to convert his first four save chances of the season. Mike Morgan converted three in a row in 2000. ... Reds manager Dusty Baker will let RHP Mike Leake start the final game of the series on Thursday as planned. Leake was arrested on a shoplifting charge Monday. ... Phillips was back in the Reds' starting lineup after missing four games with a sore groin.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK --  Throwing three pitches for strikes on a rainy night at Citi Field, Wandy Rodriguez was too much to handle for the punchless New York Mets.	The little lefty found his form Tuesday after three up-and-down starts, pitching seven sharp innings to lead the Houston Astros to a 6-1 victory.	"Wandy threw the ball extremely well. He was able to throw all of his pitches over the plate," Astros manager Brad Mills said. "He's good. So every time out we're expecting him to have a good start."	Michael Bourn and Carlos Lee sparked the offense as Houston won for the fifth time in nine games following a 1-7 start. The Astros have alternated wins and losses over those nine games.	Carlos Beltran homered for the Mets, who have dropped 11 of 13. They snapped a seven-game skid Sunday in Atlanta but followed it up with a sluggish effort in all facets of the game.	"We've got to stop it. I'm very concerned about it," manager Terry Collins said.	Jonathon Niese (0-3) walked five and threw 113 pitches in six innings as New York fell to 1-7 at Citi Field, losing its past six home games. In a matchup of the NL's two worst teams so far, it was the Mets who looked like more of a mess.	The frustration showed, too. David Wright fired his helmet toward the dugout after a first-inning flyout that would have been a home run in nearly every other ballpark. Collins argued a late call at second base.	"I didn't feel right," Niese said. "I felt a little off."	Featuring a deceptive curveball, Rodriguez (1-2) allowed only three hits and three walks, striking out a season-high seven. After signing a $34 million, three-year contract in January, he entered with a 7.31 ERA, allowing 26 hits over 16 innings in his first three starts.	"He was on. The difference was his changeup. He was able to throw all three of his pitches tonight, instead of just fastball-curveball," Houston catcher J.R. Towles said. "The rhythm was good. He's one of those guys who needs to work fast."	Fernando Abad and Jeff Fulchino finished the four-hitter.	Bourn opened the game with a single and moved to second on Angel Sanchez's sacrifice. Bourn then stole third and scored on Lee's single.	Lee also singled in the third and was shaken up on the bases.	Chris Johnson hit a grounder toward the hole and new Mets second baseman Justin Turner tried for a force play. His wild, off-balance throw went past second, so Lee took off for third. But Wright scooped up the ball and beat Lee in a race to third, diving to tag the slugger on a bang-bang play at the bag.	Lee was called out and stayed down for a moment before walking back to the dugout holding his arm. He hyperextended his left elbow on the slide as he collided with Wright, but Lee remained in the game until he was replaced in left field by Jason Bourgeois with a 6-1 lead in the eighth.	"Tough call," Lee said. "I'm fine. I think I'll be OK."	Brett Wallace singled to start the fourth and scored on a double by Towles, just back from a sprained left ankle. The eighth batter in the lineup, he finished 2-for-2 with a pair of walks to lift his average to .429.	"We got some key hits. A good game all-around," Lee said.	Sanchez drew a walk from Pedro Beato in the seventh and scored when left fielder Scott Hairston couldn't catch Lee's deep drive with two outs. The ball glanced off Hairston's glove just before his back slammed into the high fence and he was charged with an error.	"When the ball hits your glove, you've got to catch it," Hairston said. "It wasn't an easy play, but it's a play that's got to be made."	Beltran connected leading off the seventh to cut it to 3-1. All three of his homers this season have been hit right-handed at home. He has three home runs among his seven career hits against Rodriguez.	The Mets put two on with two outs but Rodriguez struck out pinch-hitter Chin-lung Hu with his 118th and final pitch.	"I had excellent location tonight. Everything was good," Rodriguez said. "I want to stay consistent, throw a lot of quality starts."	Houston tacked on three runs against New York's struggling bullpen in the eighth. Bobby Parnell was booed off the mound after balking in a run and allowing a two-run single to Sanchez.	Parnell said he's lacked feeling lately in the middle finger on his pitching hand.	Game notes	 Wright is hitless in his last 16 at-bats with seven strikeouts. ... Mets LF Jason Bay (strained left rib cage) went 4-for-4 with two homers, four RBIs and three runs scored in a rehab game with Class-A St. Lucie against Fort Myers. He was expected to come off the disabled list Thursday, but Collins said the team would discuss activating Bay on Wednesday. ... Bourn is 8-for-8 on stolen base attempts this year and has swiped 16 straight dating to last season. ... Astros SS Clint Barmes (broken left hand) said he felt no pain while taking soft-toss swings. He will be evaluated Friday and could then begin a minor league rehab assignment. The team wants him to have at least 10-12 at-bats in the minors before activating him from the DL.
