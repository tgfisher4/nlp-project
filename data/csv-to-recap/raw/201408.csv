NEW YORK --  Asked what pitch worked best against the New York Yankees, Carlos Carrasco gave a most obvious answer.	"Everything," he said.	Same goes for most everyone the Cleveland Indians are putting on the mound lately.	Carrasco rejoined the Cleveland rotation in fine fashion by throwing five scoreless innings and the Indians nearly tossed another shutout at Yankee Stadium in a 4-1 win Sunday.	Jacoby Ellsbury homered with two outs in the ninth off Indians closer Cody Allen, ending New York's season-worst scoreless streak at 19 innings. The shot let the Yankees avoid a dubious distinction -- not since 1999 had they been blanked in two straight games, STATS said.	"That was a really fun day to watch," Cleveland manager Terry Francona said. "Everyone came in and did their job."	Jason Kipnis got three hits and scored three runs as the Indians finished 4-3 against their fellow AL wild-card contender -- only twice in the last 22 years has Cleveland taken the season matchup.	A day after Cleveland pitchers combined on a five-hit shutout and struck out 15 Yankees, Carrasco (4-4) and four relievers dominated with another five-hitter.	"When you play the Yankees, you feel it in your body," he said. "You want to throw a shutout."	Carrasco allowed just two singles, walked none, struck out four and retired his last 11 batters. Pitching in place of the recently demoted Danny Salazar, Carrasco made his first start since being banished to the bullpen in late April.	Carrasco had gone 0-12 in 17 starts since 2011 -- shortly before his last win, he pitched seven scoreless innings at Yankee Stadium. He missed the 2012 season while recovering from Tommy John surgery.	The right-hander threw from the stretch all game, firing a 96 mph with his first pitch, and met catcher Yan Gomes for hand slaps and back pats outside the dugout after the final out in the fifth.	The Indians' longest shutout streak of the season left Yankees manager Joe Girardi without a guess on what went wrong.	"Not really sure," he said. "We just didn't swing the bats very well today."	Cleveland evened its record at 59-59 by taking advantage of a surprisingly shaky Hiroki Kuroda (7-8). Normally one of baseball's best control pitchers, he walked a season-high four, hit a batter and threw a wild pitch.	Kuroda issued his first bases-loaded walk since he was a major league rookie in 2008, STATS said. Gomes drew that walk for a 3-0 lead in the fifth and added an RBI single in the seventh.	Michael Brantley drove in Cleveland's first two runs with a single and a sacrifice fly.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: OF David Murphy (oblique) and DH-1B Nick Swisher (knee) went on the 15-day disabled list and OF Tyler Holt and INF-OF Zach Walters were promoted from Triple-A Columbus. Walters, acquired July 31 in the trade that sent shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera to Washington, started in left field in his Cleveland debut.	Walters went 0 for 3 with a walk and had little action in the outfield as the Indians pitchers stayed in control. "I picked some good daisies out there," he said.	Yankees: 1B Mark Teixeira returned to the lineup after missing three straight games because of an injured left pinkie. He went 1 for 4.	UP NEXT	Indians: In a scheduling quirk, Cleveland gets three off-days in the next eight days. The Indians host Arizona starting Tuesday night, with LHP T.J. House (1-3, 4.13) facing Diamondbacks RHP Josh Collmenter (8-6, 4.09). House has allowed three or fewer runs in seven straight starts.	Yankees: LHP Chris Capuano (1-2, 3.91) starts Monday night at Camden Yards as New York begins a six-game trip to AL East-leading Baltimore and division rival Tampa Bay. Capuano has pitched well since being acquired from Colorado last month, yet is winless in his last nine starts overall.	SPEEDING ALONG	Jacoby Ellsbury stole his 30th base, swiping second without a throw after a single in the Yankees first. He led the majors with 52 steals last year for Boston, and is a three-time AL stolen base champ.	WALK THIS WAY	Indians 1B Carlos Santana drew his majors-leading 82nd walk. He became the 22nd player in big league history to walk 400 times in his first five seasons, and the first since both Albert Pujols and Adam Dunn did it in 2005.	SHOPPING SPREE	Walters had a signed Derek Jeter jersey hanging in his locker after the game. Walters walked nine blocks -- "those blocks are really long here," he said -- on Saturday night to buy the souvenir at a store, then got it autographed Sunday by the Yankees star he called "an idol."	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

TORONTO -- As fans filed out of Rogers Centre following the longest game in Toronto Blue Jays history, Lionel Richie's "All Night Long" played over the sound system.	For a while, it looked like the "day" game might just go all night.	Jose Bautista's single in the 19th inning drove home the winning run as the Blue Jays rallied from a 5-0 deficit to beat the Detroit Tigers 6-5 on Sunday.	"It was a long day today and coming out on top is the only thing that matters," Bautista said.	Munenori Kawasaki singled off Rick Porcello (13-7) to begin the 19th and advanced to third when second baseman Ian Kinsler couldn't field an errant throw from Porcello on Jose Reyes' sacrifice bunt. Melky Cabrera was intentionally walked to load the bases for Bautista, who ended it with a single to right over the drawn-in outfield, sending his teammates streaming out of the dugout in celebration.	Porcello, who threw 110 pitches over seven innings against the Yankees on Thursday, and tossed a 30-pitch bullpen session Saturday, worked two-plus innings out of the bullpen as the Tigers used eight pitchers.	Porcello called the grounds crew out to work on the mound in the 17th because he was struggling with his landing spot on the well-worn dirt.	"The holes were so big," Porcello said. "I couldn't really get any kind of footing, I was falling on every pitch. There was nowhere to move around on the rubber. It was one big crater."	Led by a six-inning stint from Chad Jenkins (1-1), Toronto's bullpen threw 15 2/3 innings of scoreless relief. The Blue Jays also used eight pitchers.	"I was just out of gas," Jenkins said. "I haven't thrown six innings all year."	It was the second 19-inning game in as many days. The Los Angeles Angels beat the Boston Red Sox 5-4 on Saturday night. The last time there were two 19-inning games in the same month was July 1985.	Toronto had twice played 18 innings, doing it against the Angels on July 28, 2005, and Texas on June 8, 2013.	At 6:37, it was the longest game by time in Blue Jays history, easily surpassing a 5:57 game against the Yankees on April 19, 2001.	The lights at Rogers Centre were turned on in the 13th inning, fans rose for a 14th-inning stretch and the grounds crew came back out to clean the field for a second time as the marathon affair dragged on.	"A lot of things you don't see in everyday baseball seemed to all happen in this game," Tigers reliever Joe Nathan said.	The Blue Jays used 22 of the 25 players on their roster, with only starting pitchers R.A. Dickey, J.A. Happ and Drew Hutchison staying on the bench. Dickey did go to the bullpen and begin stretching in the 19th.	The Tigers, who didn't call up replacements for injured pitchers Anibal Sanchez and Joakim Soria, used everyone except pitchers Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander.	"We didn't think we could get them here," Detroit manager Brad Ausmus said of the decision not to bring in reinforcements from Triple-A Toledo. "Of course, if we knew we had until 7:00 to get them here, maybe we would have."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: First baseman Edwin Encarnacion (right quadriceps) started at DH and went 1 for 3 with an infield single in his first rehab game at Class-A Dunedin on Saturday night.	Tigers: Right-handers Sanchez (right pectoral strain) and Soria (left oblique) were placed on the 15-day disabled list before the game. Sanchez is expected to miss three to four weeks. Left-hander Robbie Ray will be promoted from Triple-A Toledo to start in Sanchez's place Wednesday against Pittsburgh.	ON DECK:	Blue Jays: Toronto begins a three-game series at Seattle on Monday, with Hutchison (8-9) facing Mariners righty Felix Hernandez (12-3). Hernandez is the third straight former Cy Young winner to pitch against Toronto, following Detroit's Scherzer and Price.	Tigers: Detroit begins a two-game series at Pittsburgh on Monday, with Verlander (10-10) facing Pirates left-hander Jeff Locke (3-3). Verlander is 4-0 with a 1.97 ERA in four career starts against Pittsburgh.	GOINS GOES DOWN	Toronto optioned second baseman Ryan Goins to Triple-A Buffalo following the game and will make a corresponding roster move Monday.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CINCINNATI --  Brayan Pena's tight hamstring gave Devin Mesoraco a chance to be the star.	Mesoraco homered twice, including his third grand slam of the season, and drove in a career-high six runs as the Cincinnati Reds salvaged the finale of a three-game series against the Miami Marlins with a 7-2 victory on Sunday.	Pena normally catches when Johnny Cueto pitches, but Reds manager Bryan Price determined he wasn't ready. So Mesoraco was in the lineup on Sunday afternoon after a night game.	"Devin took a foul ball off his arm yesterday but I had the good sense not to ask him about it before I made the lineup," Price said. "If there is any point in time that you run him out there, it is now when he's 26."	Brad Hand walked Todd Frazier with the bases loaded in the fifth to break a 2-all tie. Mesoraco followed with his second of the game and 20th of the season, a 371-foot drive into the left-field seats.	Mesoraco leads all major league catchers in home runs and the National League in grand slams. He is 6 for 7 (.857) with the bases loaded and is the sixth player in Reds history to hit three slams in one season -- the first since Chris Sabo in 1993.	"When guys are in scoring position, your focus gets a little better," Mesoraco said. "I saw that guys weren't giving into to him (Hand) and I was looking for a pitch that I could hit and not miss it."	The fifth-inning outburst gave Cueto (14-6) some breathing room. In eight innings, he allowed five hits -- two homers -- with two walks and nine strikeouts. He improved to 6-0 in his last seven starts.	Hand (2-4) allowed five hits and seven runs with three walks -- all in the fifth -- and two strikeouts.	"He just couldn't get through the fifth," Marlins manager Mike Redmond said. "It came down to offense from one guy."	Giancarlo Stanton, the NL's home run and RBIs leader, lined his 29th homer with two outs in the first for a 1-0 Miami lead.	Right-fielder Jay Bruce made a leaping catch in the eighth to rob Stanton of a second homer.	Mesoraco gave the Reds a 2-1 lead in the first with his first homer in 10 games since July 30, a 390-foot blast that bounced off the roof of the Cincinnati bullpen in left-center with Bruce on first and two outs.	Casey McGehee tied the game with his third homer of the year, a 383-foot shot to left with one out in the fourth.	ON DECK	Marlins: The Marlins, who took a series from St. Louis in early July for the first time since 2009, will try to make it two straight over the Cardinals. Their three-game set in Miami begins Monday with right-hander Tom Koehler taking the mound.	Reds: Right-hander Mat Latos tries to improve his career interleague record to 10-3 in 18 starts on Tuesday in the opener of a two-game home series against Boston.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: Pena's injury forced him out of Friday's game after two innings and limited him to a pinch-hit appearance on Saturday.	HOME RUN DERBY DROUGHT	Todd Frazier has not homered in his last 20 games and has just one home run since reaching the finals of the All-Star game Home Run Derby. Frazier has hit .310 in his last 14 games and doesn't feel the skills competition affected his swing. "If I was struggling I might think that," Frazier said. "Home runs come in bunches. I might hit three or four in a week. In Double-A in 2010 I went my first 115 at-bats without a home run and ended up with 17."	JOHNNY BEISBOL	Johnny Cueto, nicknamed "Johnny Beisbol" by his teammates, is 9-1 in his last 10 decisions.	REDS MENACE	Stanton's homer was his fourth of the season off Reds' pitching, the most against any opponent. He has hit two off Cueto.	WINLESS IN CINCINNATI	Marlins left-handed starters are 0-6 in Cincinnati since Dontrelle Willis beat the Reds on August 7, 2005.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

BALTIMORE -- Using their own brand of baseball, the St. Louis Cardinals showed power-hitting Baltimore they can score a bunch of runs, too.	Rookie Kolten Wong had four hits and scored twice, Peter Bourjos homered and St. Louis beat the Orioles 8-3 Sunday to avoid a three-game sweep.	After allowing nine home runs in losing the first two games of the series by a collective 22-5 score, the Cardinals amassed a season-high 17 hits -- 14 of them singles.	St. Louis came into the game with 80 home runs compared to 147 for Baltimore, but the Cardinals' style of little ball produced a big win.	"We walked in here today and that's all the conversation was, we've got to win this, we've got to figure out a way to get this one," manager Mike Matheny said. "We felt good about what our offense could do. The guys, they were taking good at-bats all day long. We got a couple big hits when we needed them; that's usually the difference."	Bourjos capped the barrage with a three-run drive in the ninth off Zach Britton, ending the left-hander's run of 27 straight scoreless appearances at home.	The additional runs seemed to be unnecessary, but against the Orioles it's hard to determine how much offense is enough.	"We saw what they can do the last couple nights and we had to keep pushing to keep pace with them and keep the lead," third baseman Daniel Descalso said.	Wong's four hits, all of them singles, matched a career high and lifted his batting average 11 points to .253.	St. Louis right-hander Lance Lynn (12-8) gave up three runs and nine hits over 5 2/3 innings, only the second time in his last 12 starts that he allowed more than two runs.	"They've got some guys that can hit the ball all the way up and down the lineup, and I knew that going in today it was going to be a grind," Lynn said. "I was able to make enough pitches when I needed to and get out of some jams."	Nick Markakis had four hits for the Orioles, who went 2 for 13 with runners in scoring position. Caleb Joseph's streak of consecutive games with a home run ended at five, one short of the club record.	Orioles manager Buck Showalter was ejected after a replay overturned an out call on a force play in the top of the seventh. His first ejection of the season was automatic after he came out to argue the result of a replay.	Baltimore starter Kevin Gausman (6-4) allowed three runs and eight hits in five innings.	"I like that he didn't let the game get away from him completely," Showalter said. "A lot of borderline pitches. It wasn't like he imploded."	The AL East-leading Orioles next host the New York Yankees for a three-game series that begins Monday night. New York trails by six games.	"We don't really look at it quite the way everybody else does," Showalter said. "It's significant because they're one of the teams we've got to be better than when the smoke clears."	St. Louis went up 4-2 in the sixth on an RBI single by Descalso, but Markakis matched that in the bottom half with a run-scoring single.	Successive doubles by Descalso and Matt Carpenter, off Andrew Miller in the eighth, made it 5-3.	Bourjos wrapped it up with his home run. He entered as a pinch runner in the seventh.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: Shortstop J.J. Hardy was a late scratch from the starting lineup with a sprained left thumb. "I was full uni, ready to go," Hardy said afterward. "I was planning on playing."	ON DECK	Cardinals: Right-hander Shelby Miller (8-8) seeks his 25th career victory Monday night in the opener of a three-game series in Miami.	Orioles: Baltimore looks to improve upon its 6-3 record against the Yankees when Bud Norris (9-7) faces New York's Chris Capuano (1-2) on Monday night.	STREAKS SNAPPED	Cardinals: Lynn hadn't allowed more than two runs in six straight starts before this one.	Orioles: Their eight-game run with at least one long ball ended. Baltimore is 56-25 when hitting a HR and 11-25 when it doesn't.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PHLADELPHIA --  After another game-ending RBI, teams might think twice about intentionally walking Chase Utley to get to Ryan Howard.	Howard singled with two outs in the ninth inning after pinch-hitter Marlon Byrd had a tying hit and the Philadelphia Phillies pulled out a 7-6 victory over the New York Mets on Sunday.	"You're not out of it until 27 outs," said Howard, who was mobbed by his teammates near first base after the hit. "It was a little hectic but, you know what? I'll take it."	Utley singled, tripled, homered and drove in three runs for the Phillies, who snapped a five-game skid against the Mets.	Lucas Duda and Travis d'Arnaud homered for New York.	The Mets appeared positioned for their 12th victory in the last 13 games against the Phillies in Philadelphia before the ninth.	Cody Asche led off with a double off Jenrry Mejia (5-5) and scored when Byrd lined a hit up the middle. Two outs later, Byrd stole second and, after getting the count to 3-2, the Mets intentionally walked Utley.	Howard followed with a single to right on a full-count pitch.	The beleaguered slugger, who recently was benched for three games, pointed skyward after rounding first before getting mobbed by his teammates near first base.	"That's big for his confidence," said Philadelphia manager Ryne Sandberg, who benched a slumping Howard for three days in late July. "He's been in these situations before. Right guy in the right place."	Ken Giles (1-0) pitched a scoreless ninth to cap four innings of scoreless relief by three Phillies bullpen arms.	It was the second time in six games Howard faced the scenario. The Astros walked Utley for Howard on Tuesday and the Philadelphia slugger singled home the winning run in Philadelphia's 2-1, 15-inning victory.	"I wasn't surprised at all," Howard said. "The winning run on second base and I didn't have any hits. I still have great confidence. I feel real good about my swing."	While Howard wasn't surprised, Mejia was.	"I want to finish (against Utley) but I'm not the manager," Mejia said. "I have to do whatever the manager wants me to do. A little bit surprised but I can't do anything. Terry Collins is the manager. I'm just the player. I have to do whatever he wants me to do."	Collins stood by his decision.	"I'm not going to let (Utley) beat me," he said. "Howard's been struggling. You've got to make him beat you. In my book, that's the way I look at it."	Zack Wheeler allowed three runs on three hits in six innings. He is 4-0 with a 1.94 ERA in his last eight games.	Kyle Kendrick extended his struggles this season. The right-hander was charged with six runs -- five earned -- on 10 hits in five innings.	"He struggled with balls over the plate," Sandberg said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: Prized prospect Jesse Biddle makes his second start for Class-A Clearwater on Monday since being shut down for a mental break on June 23. The 2010 Phillies first-round pick tossed five no-hit innings to earn the victory in Clearwater's 4-0 win last Wednesday against Daytona.	Mets: Rookie right-hander Jacob deGrom will be evaluated in New York on Monday after experiencing shoulder soreness in the days following Thursday's start against Washington. DeGrom, who is 6-5 with a 2.87 ERA in 16 starts, will not make his scheduled start on Tuesday against the Nationals. ... Mejia revealed after the game that he has been struggling with a hernia problem for the last three weeks. "Doctors say if it bothers me too much to let him fix it, but I don't want to let him know because I want to keep pitching," Mejia said.	UP NEXT	The teams close out the four-game series at 1:05 p.m. Monday when Phillies right-hander David Buchanan (6-5, 4.39) faces New York lefty Jonathon Niese (5-8, 3.51). Buchanan is filling in for injured lefty Cliff Lee, who is out for the season with an elbow strain. Niese has lost four straight games.	EXCELLENT EDGIN	Mets left-handed reliever Josh Edgin struck out all four batters he faced. Edgin is 1-0 with a 1.64 ERA with 19 strikeouts and three walks in 22 innings.	"He's done a nice job," Collins said. "He got us to the ninth inning with the lead, which is what you want."	BROWN'S MISCUE	After David Wright opened the third with a single and Duda flew out, d'Arnaud lifted a medium fly to left field that Brown appeared to pull up on too soon. Fans booed the left fielder, who has experienced offensive and defensive troubles this season.	"It appeared to be catchable," Sandberg said.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PITTSBURGH --  Tyson Ross gave up a leadoff single to Starling Marte and Gregory Polanco followed with a two-run home run.	Three batters later, Jordy Mercer singled. All three of Pittsburgh's early hits came at the expense of Ross' slider.	Even without his best pitch, Ross figured it out.	Ross recovered from a two-run first to pitch six strong innings, and Seth Smith hit a bases-loaded triple, leading the San Diego Padres to an 8-2 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Sunday.	"I just didn't have a good feel for my slider pretty much all day," Ross said. "I gave up three hits in the first inning, all on sliders that were up in the strike zone, and it's kind of out of the norm for me."	San Diego's win clinched a 14th-consecutive series victory at PNC Park.	Ross (11-10) allowed Gregory Polanco's two-run shot in the first then shut down the Pirates. He yielded six hits and walked two.	"I thought he battled without his best stuff and his best command," San Diego manager Bud Black said. "Hanging slider to Marte to lead off the game and then a hanging slider to Polanco, I think that kind of woke him up a bit."	Charlie Morton retired the first 10 batters he faced before Yangervis Solarte walked with one out in the fourth and scored Yonder Alonso's single.	"In the fourth inning, the sinker away to left-handers starting elevating," Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said. "A couple left-handers were able to get balls out over the plate and hit them to left field."	That happened when Morton left a 2-0 fastball over the plate and Smith tripled to left for three RBIs and scored on a wild pitch for a 5-2 lead.	Morton (5-11) was lifted after the fifth, responsible for five runs, five hits, a walk and five strikeouts.	"It was almost like two outings for him," Hurdle said. "One through three and then four and five, it's just two different sides of it."	Alonso added an RBI with a bases-loaded sacrifice fly in the seventh, and Jedd Gyorko singled in two more runs after Jeanmar Gomez walked three to load the bases in the ninth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: First baseman Tommy Medica was out after a pitch hit him in the head Saturday night. ... Shortstop Everth Cabrera was scratched shortly before first pitch with a left hamstring cramp.	Pirates: Second baseman Neil Walker (back spasm) was scratched from the lineup. He pinch-hit Saturday night and was slated to start Sunday. ... Center fielder Andrew McCutchen (rib) was out of the lineup for the sixth straight game. ... RHP Gerrit Cole gave up one hit in six shutout innings Sunday as he made his third rehab start for Triple-A Indianapolis.	ON DECK	Padres: San Diego returns to Petco Park to open a three-game set with the Colorado Rockies. RHP Jesse Hahn (7-3, 2.28 ERA) starts for the Padres against Colorado RHP Jordan Lyles (6-1, 3.72 ERA).	Pirates: Pittsburgh continues its eight-game homestand with a two-game interleague series against the Detroit Tigers. LHP Jeff Locke (3-3, 3.78 ERA) opposes Detroit RHP Justin Verlander (10-10, 4.57 ERA).	FRIENDLY ACCOMMODATIONS	Since PNC Park opened in 2001, the San Diego Padres have never lost a series in Pittsburgh. Their 14-series winning streak at PNC Park is the longest active streak against a single opponent in a single location in the league.	Overall, the Padres are 33-12 in Pittsburgh since 2001.	"We're just playing good baseball," Black said. "Maybe the times of the year we come in here, we're playing well and we're pitching well."	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Alex Gordon is eager for another marketing gimmick.	Gordon and Salvador Perez homered, Danny Duffy pitched into the seventh inning and the Kansas City Royals beat the San Francisco Giants 7-4 Sunday for their seventh consecutive victory.	The Royals gave out 10,000 Gordon bobbleheads for the series finale against San Francisco. Gordon, who played his college ball at Nebraska, also homered on Husker Night on Saturday.	"We've got to think of a promotion for tomorrow to keep it going," Gordon said.	The big weekend is part of a nice roll for Gordon, who is batting .350 (14 for 40) with three homers and seven RBIs in his last 11 games.	"Gordy is not swinging the bat well because it is Husker day or because it was bobblehead day," Yost said. "Gordy is swinging the bat well because he is seeing the ball well and putting good swings on it."	The Royals, who won 10 in a row in June, have put together two winning streaks of seven or more games this season for the first time since 1985, the last time they were in the playoffs.	They moved within one-half game of first-place Detroit in the AL Central. The Tigers lost 6-5 to the Toronto Blue Jays in 19 innings on Sunday.	Gordon hit a two-run shot off Tim Lincecum (9-8) in a four-run first. The inning also included Billy Butler's run-producing double and Perez scoring on a wild pitch.	"He was all over the board," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said of Lincecum. "When he threw a strike or threw an off-speed pitch it was up.  He regrouped, but it's tough when you get down four runs."	Perez homered off Juan Gutierrez with Nori Aoki aboard in a three-run fourth. Aoki reached base four times -- two walks and two singles -- and stole three bases.	Jarrod Dyson went 3 for 3 and also swiped a career-high three bases.	Duffy (7-10) allowed four runs and three hits in 6 2/3 innings in winning back-to-back starts for the first time this season. He walked two in the seventh and both scored on an Andrew Susac's double.	"You are really comfortable on the mound," Duffy said after the four-run first. "The offense just keeps doing their job. It's been a lot of fun to watch."	Lincecum, a two-time Cy Young Award winner, was roughed up for six runs and seven hits in 3 1/3 innings. Lincecum, who is winless since July 11, has a 10.59 ERA in his past four starts, giving up 20 runs and 28 hits in 17 innings.	"You just see how far you can go to give your team a chance to fight back and get in the game," Lincecum said.	Wade Davis pitched a scoreless eighth and Greg Holland worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the ninth while picking up his American League-leading 34th save in 36 opportunities.	ON DECK	Giants: After an off day Monday, right-hander Ryan Vogelsong, who has won his past two starts, will pitch Tuesday against the White Sox, the only big league team he has never faced.	Royals: Rookie Yordano Ventura starts the opener of a four-game series with Oakland. Ventura is 4-6 with a 3.39 ERA this season at home.	TRAINING ROOM	Giants: Michael Morse was a late scratch with an ingrown toenail. Gregor Blanco replaced him in left field.	Royals: Luke Hochevar, who had Tommy John surgery in spring training, will begin a throwing program on Sept. 10.	A GIANT MOVE	The Giants recalled first baseman Adam Duvall from Triple-A Fresno. Duvall was among the Pacific Coast League leaders with 26 homers, 84 RBIs and a .596 slugging percentage at the time of the promotion.	Outfielder Juan Perez was sent down to Fresno.	RUNNING ROYALS	The seven stolen bases were one shy of the Royals' record, set on Aug. 1, 1998, against Baltimore. Aoki and Dyson are the first Royals teammates to steal three bases in the same game.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MILWAUKEE -- Clayton Kershaw has set the bar so high for himself that a six-hit outing over eight innings qualifies as a subpar effort for the two-time Cy Young Award winner.	The Los Angeles Dodgers ace walked two and allowed leadoff hitters to reach base in four of his first five innings but still came away with his 11th straight victory in a 5-1 win Sunday over the Milwaukee Brewers. He struck out six, nearly five below his average per nine innings.	This equates to "struggling" for Kershaw.	"It was a struggle for him all day long. It felt like he was working hard but he kept battling and giving us chances," manager Don Mattingly said.	Nevertheless, Kershaw (14-2) lowered his league-leading ERA to 1.78 and tied for the NL lead in victories. Adrian Gonzalez drove in two runs and scored the go-ahead run in the fifth off Jimmy Nelson (2-3), and the Dodgers avoided a three-game sweep in a matchup of divisional leaders.	"It was a good one for us to bounce back and hopefully it gets us going in the right direction again," Mattingly said.	Kershaw also reached base three times and had an RBI single in the eighth. On the mound, Kershaw benefited from base-running blunders and aggressive play by the Brewers that went awry.	"It's fun to feel like a baseball player every once in a while," Kershaw said. "We get labeled as pitchers only sometimes so it's fun to get some dirt on your jersey every once in a while."	In the third, Nelson wasted his leadoff double after getting tagged out trying to advance from second on a grounder by Carlos Gomez. Later, Gomez was picked off first.	Rickie Weeks hit a leadoff double in the fifth. Two batters later, Jean Segura popped up a squeeze attempt caught by a charging Kershaw in front of the plate. He threw to third to easily double off Weeks.	"I think anytime you face a pitcher like Kershaw, if you try to just get stagnant, I don't think much is going to happen," manager Ron Roenicke said.	That strategy worked to perfection in the first. Gomez walked and stole second for his 25th steal of the year. Ryan Braun followed with an RBI single to stake Nelson to an early 1-0 lead.	But after a strong first couple innings, Nelson appeared to have trouble keeping his sinker down. Nelson allowed eight hits and two runs in six innings -- too many against Kershaw,	Gonzalez increased his season RBI total to 79. His run-scoring double in the seventh came after Carl Crawford singled and move to third following two throwing errors on a pickoff attempt.	JIMMY'S DAY	Nelson could be in line to start against Kershaw again on Friday when the Brewers start a three-game series in Los Angeles. Consider Sunday a learning experience for the Brewers rookie.	"It is the high-stress pitches you want to stay away from. You don't want to have to battle through three of your six innings," he said. "I just have to get the ball in the zone earlier in the count and force them to have early swings."	TRAINER'S ROOM	DODGERS: Shortstop Hanley Ramirez was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a strained right rib cage muscle retroactive to Saturday. Mattingly said the team was being overly cautious, and that Ramirez may need just the minimum time to recover.	BREWERS: Matt Garza, placed on the disabled list on Aug. 5 for a left rib cage muscle strain, won't start throwing again until he is "completely pain-free," Roenicke said. He added that Garza will likely need more than 15 days to return.	UP NEXT	DODGERS: Dan Haren (9-9) is the scheduled starter Monday in Atlanta, though Mattingly said newly-acquired right-hander Kevin Correia (5-13) would likely take a spot turn to give the rest of the rotation extra rest. Los Angeles is in the midst of a 20-day stretch without a day off.	BREWERS: Milwaukee assured itself of a winning homestand against top NL West teams San Francisco and Los Angeles after taking the first two games against the Dodgers. Roenicke promised the team's focus wouldn't change when a four-game series starts Monday against the last-place Cubs in Chicago. Yovani Gallardo (6-6) gets the start.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

HOUSTON --  The Texas Rangers never lost faith in rookie Nick Martinez even as his losing streak stretched to seven games.	And on Sunday against the Houston Astros they were pleased to see his work finally pay off with his first win since May 24.	Martinez pitched five solid innings and Adrian Beltre and Shin-Soo Choo both homered to lead the Rangers to a 6-2 victory over the Astros, snapping a seven-game skid against their in-state rivals.	"He's a strong kid," Rangers manager Ron Washington said of Martinez. "He works every day and he wants to be better. You've got to understand the kid is just out of A ball trying to get big league hitters out. He'll figure it out."	Martinez (2-8), who was pitching on five extra days' rest, allowed five hits and two runs with a season-high six strikeouts.	"I'm definitely relieved," he said. "It's nice to get that win. It wasn't easy. I had to battle out there."	He spent half of last season in Class-A and pitched just two games in Double-A this season before being called up after injuries decimated the Rangers' rotation.	"He's up here to win ball games," Washington said. "If we didn't have a tremendous feeling about the kid he wouldn't be up here ... we believe in him. We're going to give him all the opportunity that we can to continue to improve."	The Rangers trailed by two early before scoring twice in both the fourth and fifth innings to take a 4-2 lead. The 393rd homer of Beltre's career came off Dallas Keuchel in the sixth inning and Choo also had a solo shot in the seventh to make it 6-2.	Keuchel (10-8) allowed six hits and tied a season-high with five runs in six innings.	"I wasn't very good the last three innings, and that was the game," Keuchel said.	Jose Altuve had two hits for his 49th multihit game this season in his return after missing Saturday's game with a sore neck.	Chris Carter made it 1-0 in the first when he grounded into a force play that scored Robbie Grossman and left Altuve out at second. Carter was initially ruled out on the play, but manager Bo Porter challenged the call and it was overturned.	Altuve was plunked with one out in the third inning and added to his American League lead when he swiped second for his 46th steal. Jason Castro's single sent him home to make it 2-0.	Elvis Andrus singled to start the fourth inning and scored on a double by Alex Rios to cut the lead to 2-1. A two-out single by Adam Rosales allowed Rios to score and tie the game.	Robinson Chirinos doubled and Daniel Robertson singled to start the fifth inning. Chirinos scored and Robertson took third on a wild pitch by Keuchel to put Texas on top 3-2.	A sacrifice fly by Andrus scored Robertson to push the lead to 4-2.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: Rios left the game in the middle of the fourth inning after appearing to aggravate his sprained right ankle sliding into home in the top of the fourth inning. He had missed the previous two games because of the injury, but said after the game that he expects to play on Monday. ... Washington was encouraged by LHP Derek Holland's third rehabilitation start at Double-A Frisco on Saturday night. He struck out four in three scoreless innings. Holland, who hasn't played in the majors this season after left knee surgery, will start for Triple-A Round Rock on Thursday night.	Astros: Astros OF George Springer (quadriceps) said he felt OK on Sunday a day after taking batting practice and participating in drills on the field, but he isn't sure when he'll be able to come off the disabled list. "It's more frustrating than anything because I want to play and help," Springer said. "But ... I have to be smart about it."	UP NEXT	Rangers: Colby Lewis starts against Tampa Bay's Drew Smyly in the opener of a four game series on Monday. Lewis has gone 2-2 with a 2.30 ERA in four starts since the All-Star break and threw a complete game shutout in his last start.	Astros: Brad Peacock opposes Minnesota left-hander Tommy Milone when the Astros start a three game series with the Twins.

CHICAGO --  Anthony Rizzo was responsible for two of Chicago's 17 strikeouts Sunday. He also had the biggest hit of the game for the Cubs.	Rizzo hit a game-ending RBI single in the 12th inning, and the Cubs beat the Tampa Bay Rays 3-2 to avoid a three-game sweep.	Last-place Chicago struck out 44 times in the weekend series, setting a team record for three consecutive games, but Rizzo and touted rookie Javier Baez had two hits apiece to key a 13-hit attack in the finale. Carlos Villanueva (5-6) pitched a scoreless inning to earn the victory.	"We ran into three good pitchers, and their bullpen is very good, too," Rizzo said. "Obviously, we don't see them very often, so that makes it even tougher. Strikeouts are part of the game now. They happen."	Baez struck out in the 12th, but reached on a wild pitch that moved Ryan Sweeney to third. Baez moved to second on another wild pitch by Cesar Ramos (2-4) before Rizzo lined a single over a five-man infield and into right-center field.	"It didn't bother me," Rizzo said of the crowded infield. "I'm not a ground-ball hitter."	The Rays lost for only the fifth time in their last 23 road games. They trail Kansas City by 6 1/2 games in the race for the second AL wild card.	Tampa Bay grabbed a 2-1 lead in the seventh inning. Pinch-hitter Brandon Guyer got it started with a leadoff single against Neil Ramirez, who returned from the disabled list before the game. Guyer stole second and moved to third on a groundout before Desmond Jennings drove him in with a double.	The Cubs responded with a two-out rally in the bottom half against Grant Balfour. Sweeney doubled and scored on Chris Coghlan's triple.	Rays right-hander Alex Cobb pitched six innings of one-run ball. He allowed six hits, struck out six and walked none.	"Spectacular," Rays manager Joe Maddon said of his team's pitching in the series.	Travis Wood matched Cobb with a strong performance for the Cubs. The left-hander allowed an unearned run and four hits in six innings, but remains winless in his last 10 starts.	Wood, one of the best hitting pitchers in the majors, also helped himself with a one-out single in the fifth. He moved up on a groundout and scored on Baez's single to center.	Baez's run-scoring hit atoned for an error in the top half that allowed a run to score.	Curt Casali started the inning with a double for the Rays' second hit of the game. Logan Forsythe walked with one out before Jennings hit a slow roller to second base. The charging Baez retrieved the ball in time to make the play, only to have his off-balance throw sail wide of first base.	SO FAR	Baez, who was promoted from Triple-A Iowa on Tuesday, hit .276 with three homers and five RBIs in his first five major league games. The 21-year-old Baez also was charged with two errors in the field.	"We want him to trust his skill set," manager Rick Renteria said. "We also don't him to feel that he has to carry the team."	NO RELIEF IN SIGHT	Renteria conceded that bullpen management has been his greatest challenge as a first-year manager, a task made even greater by a slew of close games. Cubs relievers began the day with the third-most innings in the majors this season.	"That's one of the reasons why we carry eight relievers," Renteria said. "It has kind of worked out for the most part, but it is challenging, and we'll continue to do the best we can."	ON DECK	Rays left-hander Drew Smyly (6-10) is scheduled to open a four-game series at Texas on Monday night. Cubs right-hander Jake Arrieta (6-3) will take the mound for the start of a four-game set versus the Brewers on Monday.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Yoenis Cespedes and the Boston Red Sox rebounded from an exhausting 19-inning loss with an energizing victory.	Cespedes hit a three-run homer in the eighth inning, Rubby De La Rosa pitched five-hit ball into the eighth and the Red Sox won their first series in three weeks with a 3-1 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Sunday.	The teams had to go right back to work about 12 hours after a 6 1/2-hour epic won 5-4 by the Angels on Albert Pujols' homer well after midnight. Most position players were exhausted, and neither team scored in the first seven innings on a hot day at Angel Stadium.	Cespedes broke it open with his first homer for his new team, driving a pitch from Joe Smith (4-1) into the Boston bullpen in left.	The Cuban slugger went 1-for-7 in the marathon, and the former Oakland All-Star was 0-for-3 in the series finale before he hurt Smith and the Angels again with his first homer in eight games for the defending World Series champions.	"I knew I hit it well, but I didn't know it was going to be a home run," Cespedes said through a translator. "(The power drought) doesn't bother me or make me worry. I'm just putting good swings on the ball."	Smith has been outstanding for the Angels, but Cespedes has either scored or driven in seven of the 14 runs he has allowed this season. Smith hadn't allowed a run in 23 straight appearances over 23 2/3 innings before Cespedes connected to cap a rally started by first baseman Efren Navarro's error.	Smith said he missed his location on the fateful slider by "a lot. About 428 feet, I think. ... Every time I miss, he's on it. That's what good hitters do. I missed, and he got me. We'll battle again in about a week."	Mike Trout hit his 27th homer in the eighth for the Angels, matching his total from last season.	Both teams needed strong starts, and both pitchers came through.	Hector Santiago threw six scoreless innings of two-hit ball for the Angels, allowing just one runner to reach third.	De La Rosa (4-4) was even better in his first victory in four starts. With Dan Butler making his major league debut at catcher, De La Rosa had eight strikeouts and blanked the Angels until Trout's homer on his 110th pitch.	"I had a rhythm and I was really confident," De La Rosa said.	Koji Uehara pitched the ninth for his 25th save, striking out pinch hitter Josh Hamilton with a runner on as Boston took two of three from the powerful Angels.	GET SOME SLEEP	De La Rosa got more rest than his teammates because he left the ballpark while the 19-inning game was still going. He didn't put it on television at the hotel, either. "I fell asleep," he said.	STRUGGLING	The Angels (68-49) still have the majors' second-best record despite losing five of six, but their .223 batting average since the All-Star break is the American League's worst.	"There's some improvement that we need from players," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "A lot of this is cyclical. We have a lot of guys that are obviously struggling right now, and we need to just keep pushing forward. We need some hits to fall in. We've just been grinding."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: Kelly Johnson made his Boston debut, playing first base. The former Yankees third baseman was activated from the disabled list Thursday.	Angels: Left-hander Tyler Skaggs has elected to undergo Tommy John surgery, likely sidelining him until 2016.	ON DECK	Red Sox: Joe Kelly (0-0, 1.29 ERA) opens an interleague series in Cincinnati on Tuesday.	Angels: Struggling C.J. Wilson (8-8, 4.82 ERA) will start Tuesday against Philadelphia because Matt Shoemaker had to pitch three hitless innings of relief Saturday.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- Leave it to a pair of former Oakland Athletics to end one of the worst skids the Minnesota Twins have ever had against another club.	Kurt Suzuki hit a tiebreaking double and Josh Willingham added two-run homer in the eighth inning, and the Twins snapped a 12-game losing streak to Oakland by beating the A's 6-1 on Sunday.	"They've had their way with us," said Willingham, who played for the A's in 2011. "If we would've come in here and lost today, that would've been a very big disappointment. We needed to get this win."	Brian Dozier connected for his 20th homer in the first before Suzuki and Willingham each had a big hit against Luke Gregerson (2-2) in the eighth. Minnesota scored two more in the ninth to avoid a four-game sweep with its first win over the A's since last September.	Only 13-game losing streaks to the New York Yankees (2002-2003) and Texas Rangers (1998-1999) top the Twins' skid to Oakland.	"It's just one of those things," Suzuki said, struggling to find an explanation.	Phil Hughes (12-8) allowed four hits in seven innings for his second straight victory. He came out because of a cracked nail on his right index finger, which he glued back on in the clubhouse -- something he said he has done throughout his career and shouldn't keep him from making his next start.	Stephen Vogt's RBI single in the first accounted for the A's only run. The poor offensive effort wasted a second straight superb start from Jason Hammel, who gave up four hits and one run in 6 1/3 innings.	Hammel, who beat Tampa Bay his last time out, had lost his first four starts with Oakland after being acquired in a July 4 trade with the Chicago Cubs that also sent Jeff Samardzija to the AL West leaders.	"This is the best he's pitched from what I've seen," A's manager Bob Melvin said.	After they each allowed a run in the first, Hammel and Hughes quickly corrected most of the mistakes they made the rest of the way. But the biggest blunder might have been a self-inflicted one by the Twins.	With two runners on in the seventh, Jordan Schafer whiffed at a bunt and Eduardo Nunez was tagged out between third and home. Fernando Abad struck out Schafer on the next pitch.	Minnesota more than made up for the mistake in the eighth and ninth innings.	LOST IN THE SUN	Suzuki, who was a catcher for the A's from 2007-12 before returning for 15 games late last season, should know more than anybody on the Twins about how difficult the sun can be in Oakland during day games.	Instead, Suzuki provided one of Sunday's best bloopers when he never turned to catch Josh Reddick's popup that bounced off the warning track behind the plate in the fourth. Reddick drew Oakland's only walk off Hughes in the at-bat.	"They said I missed it. But I didn't think I missed it because I didn't even try to go for it," Suzuki joked. "It doesn't count as a miss."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Twins: First baseman Joe Mauer, who has been out since July 1 with a strained muscle on his right side, is expected to be activated at Houston on Monday. Infielder Trevor Plouffe (sore left foot) and outfielder Oswaldo Arcia (lower back pain) sat out. Both are day to day.	Athletics: Shortstop Jed Lowrie got the day off to rest his bruised right index finger, which sidelined him for three games last week. He's expected to start Monday at Kansas City.	UP NEXT	Twins: Minnesota will call up former A's lefty Tommy Milone from Triple-A Rochester to start Monday in Houston. Milone was dealt to the Twins at the July 31 trade deadline for outfielder Sam Fuld after going 6-3 with a 3.55 ERA for Oakland this season.	Athletics: Sonny Gray (12-5, 2.87 ERA), the AL Pitcher of the Month for July, tries to rebound from back-to-back losses in August when he goes in the opener at Kansas City.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SEATTLE --  Austin Jackson is starting the settle in with the Seattle Mariners.	Acquired in a trade with the Detroit Tigers before the deadline, Jackson matched a career-high with four RBIs to lead the Mariners to a 4-2 victory over the Chicago White Sox on Sunday.	Jackson joined the Mariners in Baltimore on Aug. 1 and has started all 10 games since the trade. Now back in Seattle, Jackson is beginning to feel comfortable in his home clubhouse.	"Once we arrived here and got that first game here under our belts. We kind of settled in a little bit," Jackson said of himself and fellow deadline acquisition Chris Denorfia. "Just seeing that we're close (to a playoff spot), I think that gives us a lot of extra motivation to go out there and get those wins. I don't think we could have gotten traded to a better team."	Logan Morrison began a two-out rally for the Mariners in the second inning off Chicago's John Danks (9-8) with a hard line drive single off the wall in right field. Infield singles by Chris Taylor and Jesus Sucre loaded the bases for Jackson.	A career .400 hitter against Danks, Jackson doubled down the left field line to give the Mariners a 3-0 lead. He finished 3 for 4.	"I can't escape him," Danks said. "I've thrown everything I know how to. I thought about taking my glove off and firing one in there right-handed just to give him another look. ... He's hit some good pitches off of me and definitely made me answer to some mistakes I made."	Seattle starter Erasmo Ramirez was pulled mid-batter in the fifth inning as Dominic Leone entered to face Gordon Beckham with a 2-1 count. Leone got Beckham to ground into a double play to end the inning.	Leone (5-2) picked up the victory and Fernando Rodney earned his 33rd save.	Taylor drew a leadoff walk in the seventh inning and moved to second on a sacrifice bunt by Sucre. Jackson singled to left as Taylor beat the throw home from Alejandro De Aza to give Seattle a 4-0 lead.	"He swung the bat extremely well. That's the type of hitter he can be," manager Lloyd McClendon said.	Tyler Flowers homered off Tom Wilhelmsen to lead off the seventh for Chicago.	Rodney allowed the first two runners to reach in the ninth. After two strikeouts, Conor Gillaspie singled to center to drive in Alexei Ramirez. Rodney then hit Flowers to load the bases before striking out Jordan Danks to seal the victory.	BECKHAM WEB GEM	Beckham made a diving stop of a grounder from Dustin Ackley to end the second inning. The second baseman laid out to his left and likely saved a run as Jackson was set to score from second if the ball had made its way into right field.	LINDSTROM READY	White Sox closer Matt Lindstrom is set to return after nearly three full months on the disabled list. Lindstrom will be recalled from Triple-A Charlotte for Tuesday's game against San Francisco. Lindstrom has been on the 15-day DL since May 20 with a dislocated tendon in his right ankle. Chicago optioned reliever Eric Surkamp to Triple-A after the game to clear space for Lindstrom.	RAMIREZ OPTIONED	The Mariners optioned Erasmo Ramirez back to Triple-A Tacoma following his start against the White Sox. The team will make a corresponding move on Monday to add a position player to the roster.	UP NEXT	Chicago: Left-hander Chris Sale (10-2, 2.14 ERA) is set to open the White Sox two-game series with San Francisco on Tuesday. Sale took the loss for only the second time this season in his last outing against Texas on August 6.	Seattle: Mariners ace Felix Hernandez (12-3, 1.97 ERA) opens a key series in the race for the second wild card against Toronto. Hernandez is riding a major league-record 15 straight starts of at least seven innings pitched with two runs or less allowed.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PHOENIX --  Corey Dickerson entered Sunday's game with eight hits in his last 15 at-bats. But until the 10th inning, the Colorado Rockies outfielder was hitless.	That changed quickly when Dickerson drove a two-out, 0-1 pitch into the pool deck beyond the right field fence for the tiebreaking home run in the Rockies' 5-3 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks.	"I try to take the barrel straight to the ball. I don't try to do too much with it," Dickerson said.	The Rockies avoided a seventh straight loss to Arizona and snapped a three-game skid overall with just their second win in 10 games.	Dickerson's 14th homer of the season came off Oliver Perez (2-2), who made a mistake with a hanging slider over the middle of the plate as he tried to use a quick-pitch.	"Going through the at-bat I went up there looking for something out over the plate," Dickerson said. "He slide-stepped that second pitch and I just used my hands in reaction."	Wilin Rosario, whose throwing error allowed the Diamondbacks to take a 3-2 lead in the fourth, hit a solo home run to tie the game in the sixth. Rosario singled in a run in the 10th to pad the Rockies' lead.	Ben Paulsen, called up Sunday to replace the injured Carlos Gonzalez on the roster, hit his first major league home run in the second, evening the score at 2.	"The home run beat us," Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson said. "We had a lot of pressure on them, we had a lot of opportunities. We were 2 of 14 with guys in scoring position."	Mark Trumbo doubled down the right field line in the first off Franklin Morales to drive in Ender Inciarte and Aaron Hill and give Arizona the lead.	Diamondbacks starter Wade Miley struck out eight in six innings, allowing three runs on five hits with two walks. Morales was also fairly sharp, allowing two earned runs on five hits in six innings.	Matt Belisle (3-6) got one out by working out of a bases-loaded jam in the bottom of the ninth for the win. LaTroy Hawkins picked up his 18th save by striking out the side in the 10th.	"We're in a position where we can't play it safe. Take chances," Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. "That's where we're at."	INCENDIARY INCIARTE	Inciarte's first-inning infield single gave him an 11-game hitting streak. Since July 12, Inciarte has hit safely in 18 of 19 games and reached base via a walk or hit in 20 of the last 21.	BROTHERS GETS VOTE OF CONFIDENCE	The Rockies' Rex Brothers gets some credit for his team's win. In the ninth with the scored tied at 3, Brothers threw out the speedy Didi Gregorius at second base on a fielder's choice, preventing runners from being on first and second with no outs. After loading the bases with a walk and single from Hill, Brothers induced a groundball to shortstop from the hot-hitting David Peralta for the second out, then gave way to Belisle. "It was kind of an instinctual play," Brothers said of throwing out Gregorius.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rockies: Gonzalez was placed on the 15-day disabled list Sunday with knee and ankle injuries. ... Pitcher Brett Anderson, on the DL since Aug. 6, will see a spine surgeon Monday morning regarding a bulging disk in his lower back.	Diamondbacks: Catcher Miguel Montero isn't injured but got a second straight day off to rest. Manager Kirk Gibson said Montero will play less over the course of the season, spelled more often by Tuffy Gosewich. ... Pitcher Daniel Hudson (second Tommy John surgery) is pitching one inning in rehab outings and could pitch an inning in the majors in September. ... Shortstop Chris Owings (left shoulder) took groundballs during infield practice Sunday and could be back by September 1.	ON DECK	Rockies: Right-hander Jordan Lyles makes his second start since returning from two months on the disabled list with a broken left hand. He's 6-1 in 13 starts and faces the San Diego Padres on the road on Monday. Lyles has allowed nine runs in 8 1/3 innings over two starts against the Padres this season.	Diamondbacks: Right-hander Josh Collmenter (8-6) starts in Cleveland on Tuesday. He's allowed three runs or less in six of his last eight outings.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ATLANTA -- A visit from the Washington Nationals came at just the right time to fire up the Atlanta Braves.	Alex Wood said he and his teammates enjoy the playoff atmosphere that comes whenever they face Washington.	Wood set a career high with 12 strikeouts in 7 1/3 innings, and the Braves beat Washington 3-1 on Sunday night to continue their recent success against the Nationals.	Atlanta won two of three in the series to cut Washington's lead to 3 1/2 games in the National League East. The Braves are 9-4 against the Nationals this season and 22-10 over the past two years.	"It's almost like a playoff game when we play them, no matter when it is," Wood said. "I think we've got some guys that are gamers in here and really enjoy that challenge and enjoy rising to that occasion."	Wood (8-9), who allowed five hits, set another career high by throwing 124 pitches.	Justin Upton homered for the Braves, who had lost nine of their previous 10.	Ian Desmond's fourth-inning homer was the only run allowed by Wood.	With the game tied 1-all, Emilio Bonifacio led off the fifth with a bunt single, despite a creative defensive effort by Gio Gonzalez (6-9). The pitcher fielded the ball with his back to first base and flipped the ball between his legs to Adam LaRoche. Bonifacio was safe despite a collision with LaRoche.	With two outs and Bonifacio on third, Jason Heyward hit a grounder to second baseman Danny Espinosa. LaRoche broke for the grounder, leaving first base uncovered because Gonzalez started running for the bag and then stopped before taking off again too late. Heyward was safe with the single as Bonifacio scored the go-ahead run.	"I should have gotten over," Gonzalez said. "There's no excuse. You've got to get over on that ball, keep your team in the game."	Nationals manager Matt Williams said Gonzalez "got caught watching the play."	"We had a shot at getting (Heyward) at first base, certainly," Williams said. "There was nobody there. Ultimately, that's the difference in the game."	Pinch hitter Evan Gattis hit a single to right field off Jerry Blevins in the eighth to drive in Chris Johnson, who walked.	Craig Kimbrel, pitching on the third straight night, had a perfect ninth to earn his 34th save.	Gonzalez gave up two runs, six hits and four walks in 4 2/3 innings. He has lost four straight starts.	Desmond led off the fourth with his 19th homer to right field. Upton tied the game in the bottom of the inning with his 21st homer.	Upton collected two career milestones with the line-drive homer. It was his 1,000th hit and gave him 500 career RBIs.	STREAKING SPAN	Denard Span's fifth-inning double to right field gave him a 14-game hitting streak. He also doubled in the seventh and has reached base in 36 consecutive games since June 28 -- seven shy of the Nationals' record set by Ryan Zimmerman from April 8 to May 25, 2009.	RESPECT THE A	Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez said he thought the fuss over Bryce Harper scuffing the "A" in the dirt behind home plate with his cleat in Saturday night's game was "silly."	The Braves' Twitter account posted during Saturday's game: "#RespectTheA."	Harper crossed the "A" on Saturday night by walking behind the umpire to the left-handed batter's box. On Sunday night, he took a more direct route to the box by walking in front of catcher Gerald Laird. Even so, Harper was booed by Braves fans before every at-bat. He was 0-for-4.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: Outfielder Steven Souza, who hurt his shoulder in a collision with the right-field wall Friday, was placed on the 15-day disabled list. Outfielder Michael Taylor was called up from Triple-A Syracuse. ... Werth started in right field after missing two straight starts with a sore right shoulder.	Braves: Gonzalez said shortstop Andrelton Simmons (sprained left ankle) might play Tuesday, take Wednesday off and then be ready for regular work.	UP NEXT	Nationals: Washington is off Monday, and right-hander Doug Fister will start in Tuesday night's game at the Mets. Fister will try to extend his successful record -- 5-0, 1.80 ERA -- when pitching with at least an extra day of rest.	Braves: Right-hander Julio Teheran will face Kevin Correia as the Braves open a four-game series against the Dodgers on Monday night. Teheran took the loss despite allowing only two runs in eight innings at the Dodgers on July 31.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PHILADELPHIA --  Anthony Recker snapped out of his slump in a big way.	Recker hit a tiebreaking, three-run homer, Jonathon Niese pitched seven sharp innings and the New York Mets beat the Philadelphia Phillies 5-3 Monday.	Recker was in an 0-for-18 skid when he connected off reliever Justin De Fratus, who had retired 17 straight batters before allowing a single to the first batter he faced after replacing David Buchanan in the seventh.	"It felt great. I needed it real bad," Recker said.	The backup catcher is from nearby Allentown, but his family and friends didn't see him play this weekend.	"They were here (Sunday)," Recker said. "They came to the wrong game."	Darin Ruf hit a two-run shot for the last-place Phillies.	Niese (6-8) gave up two runs on five hits to earn his first win since June 28. The lefty was 0-4 with a 6.04 ERA in his previous five starts.	"It seems that I lose with my good stuff and win with my bad stuff," Niese said.	Buchanan (6-6) allowed three runs and four hits in six-plus innings.	Buchanan ran into trouble when he walked Juan Lagares to start the seventh. Matt den Dekker lined an RBI double to right-center to tie it at 2. De Fratus entered and gave up a single to Wilmer Flores.	"That late in a game, you can't walk guys to start an inning," Buchanan said.	Recker then hit a full-count fastball 424 feet into the left-center field stands to make it 5-2.	With two outs in the Phillies ninth, pinch-hitter Chase Utley lined a 1-2 pitch off Jeurys Familia deep to right. A fan reached over with his cap and lifted the ball into the air and into the stands. The hit was initially ruled a two-run homer, but was overturned to an RBI double following a replay.	Ben Revere then flied out to end it.	The Mets took three of four in the wraparound series and are 13-3 in their last 16 games in Philadelphia.	The Phillies' bullpen had allowed one earned run in 24 2/3 innings before Recker, a .187 hitter, took De Fratus deep.	Daniel Murphy led off the fourth with a double to right and David Wright followed with an RBI single up the middle to give the Mets a 1-0 lead.	Ruf hit a two-run homer into the bushes behind the center-field wall to make it 2-1 in the bottom half.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: Manager Terry Collins said closer Jenrry Mejia will continue to pitch despite a hernia. Mejia is taking medication for the hernia and hopes to wait until after the season to have it repaired. ...  Rookie right-hander Jacob deGrom is likely headed to the disabled list because of tendinitis in his shoulder. He was examined in New York on Monday after experiencing shoulder soreness following his last start against Washington. DeGrom is 6-5 with a 2.87 ERA in 16 starts.	Phillies: Former Phillies catcher Darren Daulton was treated and released from a nearby hospital Sunday after falling ill at Citizens Bank Park. Daulton, who was diagnosed with brain cancer last year, participated in the team's alumni weekend.	UP NEXT	Mets: New York returns home to open a three-game series against NL East-leading Washington on Tuesday night. Rafael Montero (0-2, 5.40) will be called up from Triple-A Las Vegas to start in place of deGrom.	Phillies: Philadelphia visits the Los Angeles Angels for a two-game interleague series. Right-hander Jerome Williams, claimed off waivers Sunday, will start Tuesday night against left-hander C.J. Wilson (8-8, 4.82). Williams was 2-5 with a 6.71 ERA for Texas and Houston this season. He set career highs in games (37), starts (25), innings pitched (169 1-3) and strikeouts (107) last season with the Angels.	SHOWING OFF THE ARM	Center fielder Lagares made a perfect throw to the plate to prevent Domonic Brown from scoring on Ben Revere's single with two outs in the seventh. Brown, who doubled as a pinch-hitter, was out by several feet on Lagares' one-hop throw.	GLOVE WORK	Phillies second baseman Andres Blanco made an excellent play to rob den Dekker on a hard one-hopper in the fourth. The ball was already past Blanco on the right-field grass when he made a diving stab, got up and threw him out.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

ATLANTA --  Kevin Correia has been living a dream since he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers by the Minnesota Twins over the weekend.	The Southern California native grew up cheering for the Dodgers, and after 344 major league games, Correia finally got to pitch for his favorite childhood team.	Correia won in his debut, outpitching All-Star Julio Teheran and leading Los Angeles over the slumping Atlanta Braves 6-2 on Monday night.	"I haven't had that feeling I don't think since being called up," he said. "I come in and I have a locker next to the best pitcher on the planet (Clayton Kershaw). I couldn't be happier with the spot that I'm in right now."	Los Angeles has won four of six to increase its NL West lead to five games over San Francisco. The Braves have dropped 10 of 12 and are four games behind NL East-leading Washington.	Correia was tied for the major league lead in losses with a 5-13 record when he was traded on Saturday for a player to be named or cash. He excelled for Los Angeles, giving up one run and four hits in six innings, striking out five and walking one.	Correia did well at the plate, too. He began the day with a career .115 batting average, but went 2 for 2 and scored a run.	"Like I've always said about hitting, luck is better than skill most of the time," he said. "I kind of proved that today."	Teheran (10-9) allowed five runs and nine hits in 7 1/3 innings.	Carl Crawford got three hits and drove in two runs for Los Angeles.	The Dodgers scored three times in the eighth for a 6-1 lead. After Matt Kemp's double moved Yasiel Puig to third and chased Teheran, Crawford hit an RBI single off James Russell.	Reliever Juan Jaime then walked Justin Turner to load the bases. The next batter, A.J. Ellis, reached when shortstop Ramiro Pena threw errantly to first on a double-play attempt, and two runs scored.	Jaime and catcher Evan Gattis combined for two wild pitches and one passed ball in the eighth. Jaime, who threw 32 pitches and got two outs, also issued a second walk.	It was one of the ugliest innings that Atlanta manager Fredi Gonzalez has watched his team play this season.	"We don't throw the ball over for strikes and we had some miscommunication on some signs there with Jaime," Gonzalez said. "It's one of those things that the game got away from us."	The Braves went ahead 1-0 in the fourth on Justin Upton's RBI single.	Los Angeles scored three runs in the sixth to take a 3-1 lead.	Correia, Dee Gordon and Puig singled to load the bases, and Adrian Gonzalez and Crawford followed with RBI singles. Turner's groundout drove in a run on a ball that could've been a double play, but was bobbled by second baseman Emilio Bonifacio.	Brian Wilson faced the minimum in the seventh, and Jamey Wright struck out the side in the eighth for Los Angeles. Carlos Frias gave up Gattis' RBI single in the ninth.	Gonzalez went 2 for 5 and is hitting .357 with 20 RBIs in 84 at-bats since the All-Star break.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: With SS Hanley Ramirez on the disabled list because of a right oblique strain, his roster replacement -- Darwin Barney -- grounded out as a pinch-hitter in the seventh.	Braves: 2B Tommy La Stella hurt his right hamstring in the second inning and left the game, but said afterward that he will be ready to play on Tuesday. Pena took his place in the lineup, moving to shortstop while Bonifacio moved to second. ... SS Andrelton Simmons, sidelined by a sprained left ankle, jogged before the game and took infield and batting practice. Gonzalez said he might return in the next day or two.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: RHP Dan Haren, who starts Tuesday night vs. the Braves, was 0-5 with a 10.03 ERA in five starts before winning at the Angels 2-1 last Wednesday. In four career starts and one relief appearance at Turner Field, He is 3-1 with one save and a 5.04 ERA.	Braves: LHP Mike Minor is 2/3 with a 7.33 ERA in his last 10 starts. In five career starts against the Dodgers, Minor is 1-1 with a 2.32 ERA.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

BALTIMORE -- It was a night when both teams lamented a potentially devastating loss.	The satisfaction the Baltimore Orioles derived from beating the New York Yankees 11-3 Monday was dampened by the possibility that third baseman Manny Machado could be headed toward the disabled list with a sprained right knee.	"We'll just wait for the results," Machado said in front of his locker, where a pair of crutches stood. "Hopefully it is on the good side other than the bad."	He will have an MRI on Tuesday morning determine the severity of the injury and whether a stint on the DL is necessary.	"There's a chance we may have dodged a bullet," manager Buck Showalter said.	The Yankees had a far different problem to cope with. Their third straight defeat dropped them a season-high seven games behind the AL East-leading Orioles with 44 games remaining.	"This is the team we have. We've got to go win with the guys that we have," New York captain Derek Jeter said. "You can't sit around and be negative. We have to stay optimistic. You've got to have a lot of faith in your teammates and then you're going to get the job done."	With each loss to the Orioles, the deficit increases. There are two games left in the series that concludes Wednesday.	"I really don't think it makes a difference who you're playing," Jeter said. "We've got to find ways to win games. It's not like you can exhale when you're playing a team that's not in front of us."	Machado, a 2013 All-Star third baseman, sprained his right knee in the third inning while hitting a broken-bat grounder to shortstop. He dropped on his back in the batter's box and needed help getting off the field.	He was replaced by Chris Davis, who came up in the fifth against Chris Capuano (1-3) with a man on and New York leading 3-2. With the count full, Davis hit a drive over the right-field scoreboard for his 21st home run.	"Chris Davis was the big at-bat in the game," Capuano said. "Obviously Chris Davis is the guy you don't want to beat you. I would've liked to have that pitch a little more down in the zone, probably expand it a bit, but I left it up and it caught too much of the plate."	Nelson Cruz connected with a man on in the seventh and Jonathan Schoop added a three-run shot in the eighth to turn the game into a rout. Cruz now has 31 homers, tied for the major league lead with rookie Jose Abreu of the White Sox.	Bud Norris (10-7) gave up three runs and five hits in five innings, and the Orioles won despite committing three errors -- including two on one wacky play.	With the score tied at 1 in the top of the second inning, Carlos Beltran walked and took third on a single by Chase Headley. With Martin Prado at the plate both runners broke. As Headley got caught in a rundown, Beltran strayed off third. He headed home after Machado got the ball, and the third baseman's throw hit Beltran in the helmet. After Beltran crossed the plate, Headley came around to score after the ball bounced off the backstop.	Beltran and Headley received credit for a double steal, and Machado and Norris received errors on the play -- Norris for dropping the ball in a desperate bid to tag the sliding Headley at the plate.	New York got one hit after the second inning, a double by Jeter.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: RHP Michael Pineda (shoulder) will come off the DL and start Wednesday. Also, RHP Masahiro Tanaka (right elbow) threw from 90 feet 50 times Monday. Manager Joe Girardi said the next step for Tanaka will be throwing 120 times.	Orioles: SS J.J. Hardy missed a second straight game with a sprained left thumb.	UP NEXT	Yankees: Rookie RHP Shane Greene makes his second career start against Baltimore. On July 12, he blanked the Orioles on four hits over 7 1/3 innings.	Orioles: LHP Wei-Yin Chen vies for his 13th win, a single-season career high. He's 2-3 with a 5.76 ERA in eight starts against New York.	GOING DEEP	Yankees: For only the fourth time in 17 games, New York failed to hit a home run.	Orioles: Baltimore leads the majors with 150 home runs and is 34-10 when connecting more than once.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Pirates already had a four-run lead over an ailing Justin Verlander when Travis Snider threw out a runner at the plate in the second for an inning-ending double play.	"It very well could've been one of those things you talk about as a momentum-changer," manager Clint Hurdle said.	Snider not only saved runs, he created them.	Snider hit a pair of home runs and drove in four, Starling Marte added three RBIs and the Pirates coasted to an 11-6 victory over the Detroit Tigers on Monday night.	Gregory Polanco also threw out a runner at the plate, when Rajai Davis tried to score from second on Miguel Cabrera's single in the eighth. Even with a five-run lead at the time, the game could've become much closer.	"They left as many men on base as we did," Hurdle said. "They were a swing of the bat from being right back in the game three times tonight."	Verlander (10-11) gave up five runs on four hits and walked two before he was removed after pitching one inning with right shoulder soreness.	"Just didn't feel great," Verlander said, "and disappointing on a night that the team really needed me."	The loss, coupled with Kansas City's 3-2 win over Oakland, dropped the Tigers a half-game behind the now first-place Royals in the AL Central Division.	Pittsburgh loaded the bases against Verlander with one out in the first inning, and Marte cleared them with a triple down the left-field line. Snider drove Marte home when his grounder to first took an odd hop, and Victor Martinez couldn't glove it.	Verlander threw 40 pitches and bunted in the second before he was removed. He is scheduled to undergo an MRI in Detroit on Tuesday.	"I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little nervous," Verlander said. "I've never been through this before."	Verlander added there was no sharp pain in his shoulder, but manager Brad Ausmus removed him from the game to risk any further injury.	Snider knocked in two more in the eighth inning off Phil Coke with his eighth homer, a two-run, opposite-field shot.	Martin hit his sixth home run of the year in the sixth inning, and Ike Davis followed with his eighth.	Snider was 3 for 5 and scored three runs.	"Just another day," Snider said. "For me, it's nice to contribute offensively, and defensively, and help this team win."	Detroit scored three runs in the sixth to get within 8-4 and knock Pittsburgh starter Jeff Locke out of the game.	Cabrera, Martinez and Torii Hunter started the inning with consecutive hits, and Cabrera scored on Hunter's double. Alex Avila drove Martinez home with a single, and Hunter scored when Don Kelly hit into a fielder's choice.	Locke (4-3) was responsible for four runs, eight hits and four walks in five-plus innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: Detroit placed RHP Joakim Soria on the 15-day disabled list with a left oblique strain, retroactive to Sunday.	Pirates: Pittsburgh placed CF Andrew McCutchen on the 15-day disabled list because of a broken rib. The move is retroactive to Aug. 4. ... 2B Neil Walker (back) was out of the starting lineup for the sixth straight game. ... RHP Gerrit Cole returned to Pittsburgh after making his third rehab start Sunday. He has been on the DL since July 5 with a strained right lat. There is still no timetable for his return to action.	ON DECK	Tigers: LHP Robby Ray (1-1, 4.70 ERA) will be recalled from Triple-A Toledo to start on Tuesday in Detroit's second of two games in Pittsburgh. In one start this season against Minnesota on May 11, Ray pitched six shutout innings.	Pirates: RHP Edinson Volquez (9-7, 3.70 ERA) starts for the Pirates after allowing one hit in seven shutout innings against Miami on Thursday. Volquez hasn't fared well against Detroit in two career starts, allowing eight runs in 9 2/3 innings.	STAFF SHAKEUP	In addition to Soria's placement on the disabled list, the Tigers optioned left-handed relievers Patrick McCoy and Blaine Hardy to Triple-A Toledo. Taking their places are RHP Justin Miller and LHP Ian Krol.	The Tigers also purchased the contract of RHP Kevin Whelan from Toledo and unconditionally released LHP Casey Crosby.	Detroit's relievers have compiled a 4.38 ERA this season, the fifth-worst in the majors.	In the starting rotation, RHP Rick Porcello's start has been pushed pack to Friday. Detroit will start RHP Buck Farmer on Wednesday and RHP Max Scherzer is slated to start Thursday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

MIAMI -- Giancarlo Stanton led the Miami Marlins to a victory with his bat and his glove.	Stanton hit two home runs and made a spectacular diving catch in right field to help the Marlins beat the St. Louis Cardinals 6-5 on Monday night.	"He was definitely trying to take that game over not only with his bat, but with his glove," Marlins manager Mike Redmond said.	Stanton's 13th multihomer game established a franchise career record and he tied Hanley Ramirez for second place on the club's home run list with 148. Stanton hit a two-run homer in the first and a solo shot in the third to give him 31 on the season and five in his last five games.	"Just feeling better and having better at-bats and pitch selection is a little better," Stanton said of his recent surge.	Marlins starter Tom Koehler (8-9) allowed three runs and eight hits in five innings.	Steve Cishek escaped the ninth to record his 30th save in 33 chances. With two outs, Cishek allowed an RBI triple by Kolten Wong and an RBI single by Matt Holliday, allowing the Cardinals to pull within 6-5. Cishek struck out Matt Adams to end the game.	Jon Jay hit a two-run homer, Holliday had four hits, and Shelby Miller (8-9) allowed five runs in five innings for the Cardinals, who have lost three of four.	"We had plenty of hits, they just had bigger ones," Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said.	Stanton's diving catch to his left on the warning track took a hit away from Wong in the fifth inning.	"I was more trying to protect myself and slide on grass as opposed to dirt and make sure I secure it at the same time," Stanton said.	The catch prompted the home crowd into giving him a standing ovation, with two homers already to his credit.	"That was really cool that they appreciate things like that," Stanton said.	Koehler and the Marlins also benefited from key defensive plays by Jordany Valdespin, Christian Yelich, and Adeiny Hechavarria.	"I don't think I've had that many top-notch plays in a course of a season, that was unbelievable," Koehler said. "If you watch 'SportsCenter' tonight, there's no reason why we shouldn't have all 10 (top plays)."	The Cardinals were 2 for 11 with runners in scoring position.	The Marlins led 3-0 after Stanton's homers, but the Cardinals tied it with three runs in the fourth.	"I made some pitches, but when it came down to the best hitter on their team I threw two of the worst pitches I've probably thrown all night," Miller said.	Hechavarria and Yelich drove in runs in the bottom of the inning to put the Marlins up 5-3.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins hard-throwing right-hander Carter Capps, who has been out since May 25 with a right elbow sprain, could make his return to the team as early as September.	"He's feeling good and from what I've heard, everything is going great, he's feeling great," Redmond said.	UP NEXT	Cardinals right-hander Adam Wainwright (14-6, 2.28) will take the mound Tuesday against Marlins right-hander Jarred Cosart (0-1, 6.75). Wainwright will be making his first start against the Marlins in four years and Cosart will be making his return to the mound after being scratched from his last start with a sore left oblique.	CISHEK IN RARE COMPANY	Cishek became only the third pitcher in Marlins history to record back-to-back 30-save seasons, joining Juan Carlos Oviedo (2010-11) and Robb Nenn (1996-97).	JAY SHOWING POWER	Jay has hit two home runs in his last three games after going homerless in his previous 93 games. The Miami native was able to hit his third homer of the season in front of a number of friends and family members in attendance.	"It's always fun to come back home, but I'm here trying to win some games," Jay said.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Drew Smyly was well on the way to his first win since joining the Tampa Bay Rays in the trade that cost them David Price.	The left-hander wanted to get it without allowing any runs, and he did thanks to a little help.	Smyly allowed three hits and struck out the final batter he faced in his only shaky inning, Matt Joyce had a two-run single and the Rays beat the Texas Rangers 7-0 on Monday night.	Smyly struck out nine in a career-high 7 2/3 innings to beat the Rangers for the second time this season. The left-hander hasn't allowed Texas an earned run in three appearances, including a start and a relief outing when he was still with Detroit.	Smyly (7-10), who lost at Oakland five days after the Price deal at the non-waiver trading deadline July 31, got Shin-Soo Choo swinging for the second out with runners at second and third in the eighth.	"He was so good," Rays manager Joe Maddon said. "He was in command of everything. He was still throwing 92 when he punched out Choo at the end."	Reliever Joel Peralta preserved the shutout by getting Jim Adduci on a bases-loaded grounder.	Before Adrian Beltre's line-drive single to left center in the seventh inning, the only hit for the Rangers was a bunt by Daniel Robertson in the third. Rougned Odor had a bloop double off Smyly in the eighth.	"It was the longest game of my career, so it might have been my best," Smyly said. "Some days you're really feeling it."	Colby Lewis (8-9) couldn't build on the momentum of his second career shutout, giving up five runs in five innings.	Just two of the runs were earned because Tampa Bay's three-run second inning was sparked by the Texas right-hander's throwing error trying to get Cole Figueroa at third on a sacrifice bunt attempt by Curt Casali. Lewis also had four walks and hit a batter.	"Beat myself, that's all there is to it," Lewis said. "That can be your guys' quote. I really don't have much more than that."	Lewis had a chance to escape the second with a 1-0 deficit before Joyce's two-out, bases-loaded hit for a 3-0 lead. The sharp single to right field came after Joyce ripped a line drive that was just foul and struck a security guard in the face. The man was bleeding as he was led off the field.	"Colby threw some tough pitches," said Joyce, who walked twice and was hit by a pitch. "I fought off a tough one. Then I finally got one I could handle."	SHARING THE WEALTH	Figueroa, Desmond Jennings, Ben Zobrist and Evan Longoria each had a run-scoring hit for Tampa Bay. Figueroa also had a double and scored twice. Zobrist was the other Tampa player with two hits and has reached base 16 times in 25 plate appearances over five games.	TIMES HAVE CHANGED	Tampa Bay played its first game at the Rangers since beating them 5-2 in a playoff for the second wild-card spot last season. That was after Texas beat the Rays in AL Division Series in 2010 and 2011 on the way to the first two World Series appearances for the franchise. Now the Rays are on the fringe of the wild-card race and the Rangers are 26 games under .500.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: RF Kevin Kiermaier left the game in the seventh inning with tightness in his lower back. The move was precautionary. Wil Myers, on the disabled list since June 1 because of a fractured right wrist, played right field Monday night on a rehab assignment with Triple-A Durham.	Rangers: RF Alex Rios was out after aggravating his sprained right ankle with a slide into home Sunday against Houston. The MRI revealed no significant damage and he could return Tuesday night. Rios originally injured the ankle July 19 at Toronto.	ON DECK	Rays RHP Jeremy Hellickson (1-1, 2.61) makes his fourth start since returning from right elbow surgery. Tampa's oldest starting pitcher at 27 years, 126 days, Hellickson is 0-3 with a 5.03 ERA against the Rangers. Texas RHP Nick Tepesch (4-7, 4.46) faces the Rays for the first time since beating them in his major league debut last season.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

CHICAGO -- Up and down and side to side, Yovani Gallardo threw his fastball right where he wanted it to go. It made a big difference for the right-hander.	Gallardo pitched seven sparkling innings and Khris Davis had a tiebreaking RBI double, leading the Milwaukee Brewers to a 3-1 victory over the Chicago Cubs on Monday night.	Gallardo bounced back nicely from a sluggish outing against San Francisco, allowing one run and six hits while improving to 9-3 with a 3.00 ERA in 18 career starts against Chicago.	"Just command, to be honest," he said when asked about the difference from his previous start. "I was able to command the fastball to both sides of the plate. I was able to go up and out of the zone whenever I needed to."	Scooter Gennett had two hits, including an RBI single in the ninth, and Mark Reynolds connected for his 20th homer as Milwaukee opened a seven-game trip with its fourth victory in five games.	Coming off his worst start of the year, Jake Arrieta gave up two runs and five hits in 7 1/3 innings for the Cubs. The right-hander was hit hard in a loss at Colorado on Wednesday, allowing season highs of nine runs and 13 hits in five-plus innings.	"It was a little better from start to finish, a little better consistency with everything down in the zone, a lot of ground balls, a lot of early outs," he said.	Arrieta (6-4) retired 13 in a row before Ryan Braun started the seventh with a single to center. Braun was cut down at the plate when he tried to score from second on Gennett's one-out double, but Davis followed with a liner into the left-field corner to give the Brewers a 2-1 lead.	"That was huge," Brewers manager Ron Roenicke said. "You hate when you lose an opportunity to score, and he turns around and drives the guy in."	It was more than enough for Gallardo (7-6), who retired his last seven batters. He struck out six and walked none in only his second victory in his last nine starts for the NL Central leaders.	Will Smith pitched a perfect eighth and Francisco Rodriguez finished the seven-hitter for his major league-best 36th save in 40 opportunities.	Reynolds connected with two out in the second, ending a 1-for-18 slump since his previous homer on Aug. 3 at St. Louis.	Reynolds' deep drive to left on Arrieta's first pitch was gloved by a Cubs fan in the back row of the bleachers, earning a loud ovation from the crowd of 28,927. He quickly grabbed an older ball from his seat and threw it on the field, drawing another round of applause with the common trick in the outfield stands at Wrigley Field.	Chicago tied it at 1 in the fifth on Chris Coghlan's two-out double.	WHAT A BATTLE	Rodriguez and Anthony Rizzo faced off in a battle of All-Stars in the ninth, with the closer striking out the first baseman on the 13th pitch of the at-bat. Rodriguez said he threw every pitch he had to the slugger.	"Pretty good young hitter," Rodriguez said. "So I respect him."	HOSTILE RECEPTION	Braun was booed every time he came to the plate and heard chants of "Steroids! Steroids!" and "You're a cheater!" He was suspended for the final 65 games of last season for violating Major League Baseball's anti-drug agreement.	UP NEXT	Milwaukee RHP Wily Peralta (14-6, 3.42 ERA) tries for his sixth consecutive win when he takes on rookie RHP Kyle Hendricks (3-1, 2.10 ERA) in the second game of the four-game series. Peralta is 10-1 with a 4.06 ERA in his last 12 starts, but is winless in two career outings at Wrigley. Hendricks has won each of his last two starts for Chicago.	---	Jay Cohen can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/jcohenap	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Alcides Escobar pumped his fist. Jarrod Dyson did a backflip. And for the first time in more than a decade, the Kansas City Royals were in first place in mid-August.	Yordano Ventura outpitched Sonny Gray in a matchup of talented young starters Monday night, and Escobar drove in the go-ahead run as Kansas City beat the Oakland Athletics 3-2 to take over the AL Central lead from Detroit with its eighth consecutive victory.	"You want to be in first place. Our goal was to get back to first place," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "Now our goal is to stay in first place."	The Royals trailed the Tigers by eight games on July 21, but their 16th win in 19 games wiped away the deficit and gave them the lead at the latest point in a season since 2003.	"We're playing great," said Escobar, who drove in a run in the second inning before his two-out single off Gray (12-6) in the seventh gave Kansas City the lead for good.	Ventura lasted through six innings before giving way to Kelvin Herrera (3-2), who tossed a spotless seventh. Wade Davis breezed through the eighth and Greg Holland worked the ninth for his 35th save, though it didn't come without a little drama.	Josh Donaldson led off the ninth with a single, the first hit by the Athletics since the second inning, and Brandon Moss drew a walk. But after a brief conference on the mound, Holland got Derek Norris to bounce into a double play and Stephen Vogt to fly out to end the game.	"He has the ability to focus pitch to pitch, which good closers can do," Yost said. "You get first and second with his stuff, you just have a feeling he's going to get out of it."	Kansas City put pressure on right from the start, when Dyson and Omar Infante opened the game with back-to-back singles. Gray might have escaped the jam, though, if right fielder Josh Reddick hadn't flubbed a routine throw to the infield after Infante's hit. It allowed Dyson to reach third base easily, and he scored on Salvador Perez's double-play groundout.	"It's pretty embarrassing," Reddick said, "especially since it cost us a run. And we end up losing by one run, so it doesn't make your feel any better."	After Escobar made it 2-0 in th second, Oakland answered with some help from Ventura, who worked to overcome command problems most of the night. John Jaso led off with a single, Coco Crisp worked a walk and Donaldson earned another free pass to load the bases with two outs.	Moss hit a full-count pitch up the middle to score both runners and knot the game.	Yost pulled Ventura after a double play got the rookie right-hander through the sixth. And when Gray faltered in the seventh and Kansas City took the lead, one of the stingiest bullpens in baseball made sure the smallest of margins was enough.	"Those three guys at the end are as good as you get," A's manager Bob Melvin said. "They don't worry about righty-lefty. They feel when they get to the seventh inning with a lead, they feel pretty good about it."	LEADERS OF THE PACK	The Royals have not trailed since the first inning of Thursday's game in Arizona, a span of 44 innings. "There's just a real confidence right now when we step on the field," Yost said.	BULLISH BULLPENS	Herrera has worked 17 1/3 consecutive scoreless dating to June 27. That's the third-longest stretch in the majors behind Davis, who has gone 17 2/3 innings, and the A's Ryan Cook, who has gone 19 innings.	GRAY AREA	Gray struck out a career-low two batters while losing to Kansas City for the second time in his young career. The only other team he's lost to twice is Baltimore.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: SS Jed Lowrie was back in the starting lineup. He's missed time recently with a bruised right index finger.	Royals: 1B Eric Hosmer continues to wear a brace on his right hand after breaking his third metacarpal. He hopes to return in September.	UP NEXT	LHP Jon Lester, who beat the Royals in his first start with Oakland, tries to move to 3-0 since arriving from Boston in a July 31 trade. Kansas City counters with RHP Jeremy Guthrie.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

HOUSTON --  Monday was a day of ups and downs for Joe Mauer.	Luckily for Minnesota's star first baseman the long day ended on a positive note.	Mauer had two hits in his return from the disabled list, including a go-ahead RBI single in the ninth inning, to help the Twins to a 4-2 win over the Houston Astros on Monday night.	Mauer was elated to rejoin his team after a 34-game stint on the disabled list with a strained muscle in his right side. But his excitement was tempered when Josh Willingham, one of his best friends on the team, was traded to the Royals just before the game.	"I was on a high coming in and seeing everybody and then to see one of our guys go out that was pretty tough," he said. "But then to win the ballgame was a good way to end it."	A pair of walks by Josh Fields (2-5) left runners at first and second with two outs in the ninth when Mauer hit a groundball single to left field that scored Jordan Schafer. Brian Dozier also scored on the play when rookie left fielder Domingo Santana held the ball for several seconds before throwing it in.	"I just panicked," Santana said. "I was just trying to throw the ball to the cutoff man, but I just panicked."	Mauer, who doubled in the third inning, extended his hitting streak to 13 games in his first game since July 1.	"This guy, I've always said he can get right out of bed and hit," Minnesota manager Ron Gardenhire said.	Brian Duensing (3-2) got the last two outs of the eighth inning for the win and Glen Perkins pitched a scoreless ninth for his 29th save.	Chris Carter and Jose Altuve both had solo homers for Houston and Jake Marisnick had a career-high four hits. Carter connected for his 26th homer to make it 2-2 in the fifth inning.	Tommy Milone allowed eight hits and two runs in his debut with the Twins after being traded from Oakland for Sam Fuld on July 31.	"Good to get the first one out of the way," Milone said. "Obviously going out there with a new team you want to pitch well and I felt like I did that."	Houston starter Brad Peacock allowed seven hits and two runs in five innings.	Eduardo Escobar was at third with two outs in the fourth when an error by Peacock on a pickoff attempt at first base allowed him to score and make it 2-1. First baseman Jon Singleton crashed into first base umpire Bill Welke and knocked him to the ground as he chased the ball. Welke was OK but got up slowly and kept trying to brush the dirt off his uniform for more than an inning.	The Twins took a 1-0 lead in the first on Plouffe's fielder's choice.	The Astros tied it up in the bottom of the inning on Altuve's homer.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Minnesota: RHP Ricky Nolasco (elbow) made his second rehabilitation start for Class A Cedar Rapids on Sunday and Gardenhire said that he should make his next start for the Twins.	Houston: OF Alex Presley (strained right side) will begin a rehabilitation assignment with short-season Class A Tri-City on Tuesday. Presley expects to come off the DL sometime during Houston's upcoming road trip to Boston and New York.	UP NEXT	Houston's Collin McHugh opposes Yohan Pino when the series continues on Tuesday night. Pino is looking for his first win since July 10 and McHugh will try to snap a six-game skid.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

SEATTLE -- For all that Felix Hernandez has done in his career, pitching meaningful games in the final two months of the season has been a rarity.	With Seattle in the thick of the wild-card chase in the American League, Hernandez got the Mariners' most anticipated home series since 2007 off to an electric start Monday night.	Hernandez allowed one run in seven strong innings, extending his major league record streak, and Robinson Cano provided a jolt of run support as Seattle romped to an 11-1 win over the Toronto Blue Jays.	Hernandez twirled another gem, making his 16th straight start of at least seven innings while allowing two earned runs or fewer. Hernandez needed just 96 pitches to get through seven, and his only mistake was Jose Bautista's solo home run in the fourth.	And he did it before a buzzing crowd of 41,168 as Seattle remained one game back in the chase for the second wild-card spot.	"That was unreal. That was pretty good," Hernandez said. "We're fighting. We're going to continue to fight and do the little things."	For a change, Hernandez wasn't left wondering whether Seattle would score enough.	Cano ignited a seven-run sixth inning with his 10th homer of the season for a 3-1 lead.	That was just the beginning of Seattle's biggest inning since an eight-run outburst May 3 against Houston. Mike Zunino followed with an RBI triple, and an RBI double by Endy Chavez ended the night for Toronto starter Drew Hutchison (8-10).	Brad Miller lined an RBI triple, and Dustin Ackley brought home two runs with a single. Cano came up again, and after stepping out of the box while a lightning bolt and thunder crackled outside the stadium, he just missed a second homer in the inning by inches with an RBI double off the wall.	"Everything I saw was away ... so I was just trying to go the other way, but I wasn't trying to hit a homer," Cano said.	A day after going 19 innings to beat Detroit at home and not arriving to Seattle until 12:30 a.m. local time, Bautista's 23rd homer was the only highlight for Toronto. The only other Toronto batter to get a hit was Colby Rasmus, who had two and is now 7-for-10 against Hernandez.	King Felix struck out eight, walked none and lowered his ERA to 1.95 for the season. He is 9-2 with a 1.41 ERA during the 16-game streak.	"With Felix out there, you give those guys a lead, they put it away," Toronto manager John Gibbons said.	WEB GEMS	Cano cut down a potential scoring opportunity for Toronto in the second. After Rasmus doubled, Dioner Navarro hit a grounder to second. Cano threw to third and got Rasmus trying to advance. Hernandez then got a double-play grounder from Danny Valencia to get out of the inning.	Cano later added an over-the-shoulder basket catch running down the right-field line.	2K KING	Hernandez became the first pitcher since Dwight Gooden to reach 2,000 innings during or before his age-28 season. Hernandez, 28, reached the mark when he completed the second inning.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: First baseman Adam Lind (foot) is expected to join the team Tuesday in Seattle, and 1B Edwin Encarnacion (quad) is still on track to rejoin the team Friday in Chicago.	Mariners: Outfielder Michael Saunders (oblique) will have his rehab assignment delayed by a few days. He was set to leave Triple-A Tacoma to be with his wife for the birth of their child.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays: J.A. Happ (8-6) has thrown at least seven innings in each of his past two starts but has just one victory since June 26. He has given up three earned runs combined in his past two starts, and the Blue Jays have lost both games.	Mariners: Chris Young (10-6) is 5-2 with a 2.79 ERA in his past 10 starts. Young has reached 11 victories only twice in his career.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

SAN DIEGO --  The Colorado Rockies didn't have a chance against the San Diego Padres' bullpen.	Three relievers combined to strike out nine of the final 12 batters, including the last seven, and Yangervis Solarte hit a go-ahead, two-run home run in the seventh inning of a 4-3 Padres victory Monday night.	"That's awesome to do that," said Nick Vincent (1-2) who earned the win with two perfect innings, including three strikeouts. Kevin Quackenbush struck out the side in the eighth and Joaquin Benoit struck out the side in the ninth for his sixth save in seven chances.	"It shows the fight we have in this club," Vincent said.	Rookie starter Jesse Hahn didn't have his best stuff and left trailing 3-1 after allowing Corey Dickerson hit a three-run homer in the sixth.	But Solarte's homer and the bullpen assured he wouldn't be tagged with the loss.	"That was awesome. I was in here watching it. It was just an unbelievable job by the guys," Hahn said.	Since stats started being tracked during the 1974 season, the Padres are the fourth major league team to end a game with seven or more consecutive strikeouts.	"The bullpen has been really solid all year," manager Bud Black said. "Look at the performance the guys have put out there. There's a lot of guys under the radar, not known nationally. But in the industry, you look at what a number of those guys have done during their major league service time."	Dickerson said the Padres relievers "were in kind of a zone. They got a lead and the back of their bullpen is pretty good and they pounded the strike zone. We didn't put together any good at-bats. We put three balls in plays, but not enough."	Yonder Alonso hit a solo homer in the fourth for the Padres, who improved to 14-8 since the All-Star break. They've won nine of their last 12 games.	Solarte homered to left with one out in the seventh on a 1-0 pitch from Boone Logan (2-3), who came on to start the inning. Pinch-hitter Abraham Almonte hit a leadoff double and was sacrificed by Will Venable ahead of Solarte's shot. It was his third with the Padres and ninth overall this year.	Nick Vincent (1-2) pitched two perfect innings for the win.	Dickerson hit a high, arching shot to right on a 2-1 curveball into the seats in right to chase Hahn in the sixth. Justin Morneau and Nolan Arenado were aboard on singles. It was Dickerson's 15th. He hit a tie-breaking homer in an extra-inning win at Arizona on Sunday.	"I was looking for a fastball," Dickerson said. "They threw in a couple of times and moved my feet. I was just trying to get my foot down for the fastball and he hung it and I recognized it and put a good swing on it."	Hahn failed to get out of the sixth for the second straight start. He allowed three runs and five hits in five-plus innings, struck out three and walked three.	Rockies starter Jordan Lyles allowed two runs and four hits in 5 1/3 innings, struck out four and walked three.	Alonso homered on a 1-0 pitch from Lyles with one out in the fourth, his seventh.  The Padres had a chance to add another run but Jedd Gyorko was thrown out trying to score from first on a double to center by Yasmani Grandal.	The Padres loaded the bases with one out in the sixth but scored only one run, on a sacrifice fly by Rymer Liriano.	NEW GUY	Liriano was making his big league debut after being promoted earlier in the day from Triple-A El Paso. Liriano started in right field and went 0 for 2 with the sac fly and was hit by a pitch.	NEW GUY II	A.J. Preller, hired as the Padres' general manager on Wednesday, met with the players before the game and then watched them in person for the first time. Preller said before the game that it's been such a whirlwind that he hopes he can remember where in Texas he left his car. He had been the assistant general manager of the Texas Rangers.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: RHP Andrew Cashner, who's been on the disabled list since June 21 with a sore right shoulder, is scheduled to make rehab starts for Triple-A El Paso on Wednesday and Monday. Manager Bud Black said Cashner needs to build up his pitch count after throwing 24 pitches in a rehab start	UP NEXT	Rockies: Rookie Yohan Flande (0-4, 5.77 ERA) is still looking for his first victory. Tuesday night will be his seventh start and eighth appearance.	Padres: RHP Odrisamer Despaigne (2-3, 3.10) looks to win consecutive starts for the first time since June 23 and 29, which were his first two big league starts.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PITTSBURGH --  Clint Hurdle did his best to ignore the doubters when the Pittsburgh Pirates took a $5 million flier on Edinson Volquez.	"That's why they call it noise," Hurdle said.	Funny, it's quiet now.	The resurgent right-hander continued his career resurrection on Tuesday night, limiting the Detroit Tigers for six effective innings in a 4-2 victory. Volquez (10-7) allowed two runs on five hits, striking out five against two walks. His best play, however, wasn't a pitch but a slick behind-the-back grab of a chopper by Victor Martinez in the first inning that kept the Tigers from extending an early 1-0 lead.	"The ball got me," Volquez said. "I got lucky on that one."	Maybe, but Volquez isn't ruling out karma either.	There were times over the last five years when that ball would find its way to centerfield and Volquez would crumble. Not this time. The former All-Star turned reclamation project has been one of the few constants in a pitching rotation that's seen top end starters Francisco Liriano and Gerrit Cole spend significant time on the disabled list.	"He's been fun to watch," Hurdle said. "From the time we got him he showed up wanting to get better and wanting to learn."	Travis Snider went 2 for 4 with an RBI for the Pirates. Gaby Sanchez and Ike Davis added RBI doubles and Jordy Mercer chipped in a run-scoring single. Mark Melancon worked out of a two-on, one-out jam for his 22nd save as Pittsburgh improved to 5-3 without star centerfielder Andrew McCutchen, who is on the disabled list with a rib injury.	Alex Avila hit his ninth homer of the season for Detroit.	Robbie Ray (1-2) gave up four runs in five-plus innings while making a spot start for the weary Tigers. Detroit has lost six of seven as it battles surging Kansas City for the lead in the AL Central.	"We've got to make our own opportunities," Detroit manager Brad Ausmus said. "We've got to take advantage of those opportunities and we're not doing that."	Detroit's best chance came in the first.	Ian Kinsler drove home Ezequiel Carrera with an RBI-single in the first and Miguel Cabrera followed with a single to put runners at the corners. Martinez smashed a grounder up the middle that Volquez somehow grabbed with his glove while reaching behind his back. Kinsler was tagged out in a rundown between third and home and the big inning was avoided.	It was the only reprieve Volquez needed.	Sanchez and Snider delivered consecutive RBI doubles in the second off Roy to put the Pirates in front.	Mercer drove home Josh Harrison in the third to make it 3-1. Avila hit a long home run to center to pull Detroit within one but pinch hitter Ike Davis doubled to the gap in right-center to score Starling Marte and push the lead to 4-2.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: Officially placed RHP Anibal Sanchez on the 15-day disabled list retroactive to Aug. 9 with a right pectoral strain and recalled left-handed reliever Blaine Hardy from Triple-A Toledo.	An MRI on Cy Young winner Justin Verlander's sore shoulder on Tuesday revealed no major structural damage, though Ausmus called it "unlikely" that Verlander would make his next scheduled start on Sunday against Seattle.	Pirates: The team continues to take a cautious approach with Cole, who has been on the disabled list since July 5 with a right lat injury. The former No. 1 pick will start for Triple-A Indianapolis on Sunday. Hurdle said the team would like to see Cole get one more start under his belt without any setbacks before making his return.	Pittsburgh second baseman Neil Walker's bad back kept him out of the lineup on Tuesday, though Hurdle said Walker is making significant progress.	ON DECK	The interleague series between the two clubs moves to Detroit on Wednesday.	Rookie Buck Farmer will make his major league debut for the Tigers. The fifth-round pick in the 2013 draft went 10-5 with a 2.60 ERA in 18 starts for Class A West Michigan and went 1-0 in two starts with Double-A Erie.	Vance Worley (5-1, 2.30 ERA) will start for Pittsburgh. Worley is 3-0 with a 0.96 ERA in his last four starts.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ATLANTA --  The Dodgers are getting solid performances out of their starting pitchers.	Pretty good hitting, too.	Dan Haren pitched six innings and sparked the go-ahead rally with a single, leading Los Angeles to another win over the skidding Atlanta Braves, 4-2 on Tuesday night.	It was the second night in a row the Dodgers got production out of the ninth spot in the order. The previous night, Kevin Correia had two hits and scored a run.	"I was hoping I didn't get thrown out," Haren (10-9) quipped about his hit to right-center field. "It takes me about eight seconds to get to first."	After allowing a fourth-inning homer to B.J. Upton that put the Braves up 2-1, Haren reached base with one out in the fifth. Carl Crawford followed with a double, sending Haren to third, and the pitcher scored the tying run on Yasiel Puig's grounder to third.	"Puig hit the ball and I wasn't sure if it was going to the pitcher," Haren said. "I just went!"	Matt Kemp hit a little blooper to right that just got over the glove of second baseman Tommy La Stella, bringing home Crawford.	That was enough for the Dodgers.	Mike Minor (4-8) matched his longest outing of the past month after being skipped his previous turn in the rotation. The Atlanta lefty went 6 2/3 innings, allowing eight hits and three runs.	Kenley Jansen earned his 33rd save.	The Braves lost for the 11th time in their last 13 games, including two straight to the Dodgers.	With Los Angeles up 1-0, Upton drove his ninth homer of the season deep into left-field seats. It was his sixth career homer off the Dodgers right-hander; Upton has no more than three homers against anyone else.	Minor came into the game with a 5.42 ERA, having surrendered nine hits, two homers and five runs in his most recent start Aug. 1, a 10-1 loss at San Diego.	"I changed some things mechanically, with some of my grips. I thought my stuff was moving better," Minor said. "It was encouraging."	The Dodgers padded their lead in the ninth without a hit. Braves shortstop Emilio Bonifacio botched an easy grounder, and Darwin Barney hustled all the way to second on the error. Barney moved to third on a groundout, and scored on David Hale's wild pitch.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: 2B Dee Gordon didn't start because manager Don Mattingly wants to make sure the slender infielder doesn't get too worn down in the heat of summer. "Trying to keep him at 170 (pounds), basically," Mattingly said before the game. Gordon struck out as a pinch hitter in the seventh.	Braves: SS Andrelton Simmons took grounders before the game and continues to show improvement from a sprained left ankle. But he missed his sixth straight game, with Bonifacio starting in his place. La Stella, who had to leave Monday's game in the second inning, was back in the lineup after his right hamstring cramped because of dehydration.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: LHP Hyun-Jin Ryu (13-5) goes for his fifth straight win. Since July 13, he has allowed only seven earned runs in 33 innings (1.91 ERA) while limiting opposing hitters to a .198 average. He has 32 strikeouts and only four walks during his winning streak.	Braves: Ervin Santana (11-6) will also be looking to stretch his winning streak to five in a row. He has worked at least six innings in his last 13 starts, and hasn't gone less than five innings in any start this season.	YOU GOT IT, NO YOU GOT IT	After the Braves tied the game in the third, Jason Heyward popped up right beside the batting circle for the apparent third out. But catcher A.J. Ellis backed off at the last second, apparently thinking first baseman Scott Van Slyke would take it. Van Slyke had stopped a few feet away, however. The ball fell in foul territory between the two players, who just stared at each other in disbelief. The miscue didn't hurt the Dodgers; Heyward flied out to left to end the inning.	---	Follow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

CINCINNATI --  After being brushed back, Yoenis Cespedes got payback.	One pitch after ducking away from Jonathan Broxton's high-and-inside fastball, Cespedes launched a no-doubt, 433-foot drive to center field with two outs in the eighth inning, lifting the Boston Red Sox to a 3-2 win over the Cincinnati Reds on Tuesday night.	"A lot of times when pitchers throw high and tight, they think the batter backs off and gets flustered," Cespdes said after the game through a translator. "That's not how I am. I get more focused."	Manager John Farrell pointed out that the eighth-inning, go-ahead homer was Cespedes's second in two games, giving Boston back-to-back victories for the first time since a five-game winning streak from July 13-20. Cespedes hit a three-run homer in the eighth inning of Sunday's 3-1 win over the Angels.	"Broxton stood him up, then he got a fastball out over the plate, and (Cespedes) showed how strong he is," Farrell said. "I'm not saying it was intentional."	Cespedes hit his 19th homer of the season. He has reached base at least once in all nine games he's played for the Red Sox since they acquired him from Oakland in a trade.	Broxton's approach was the same used by the Reds all night, manager Bryan Price said.	"I have no regrets about Broxton," Price said. "He went right after (Cespedes). We jammed him the first two times up. We were trying to come inside on him."	Tommy Layne (1-0) got the final out of the seventh inning for the win. Broxton (4-1) was the loser.	Kojo Uehara pitched the ninth for his 26th save.	Boston starter Joe Kelly opened the interleague game with seven straight balls. When he finally threw a strike to Jay Bruce, Billy Hamilton stole second and went to third on catcher Christian Vazquez's throwing error.	Kelly walked Bruce, setting up Todd Frazier's RBI single. Devin Mesoraco, who hit a grand slam and two-run homer while setting a career high with six RBIs in Cincinnati's 7-2 win over Miami on Sunday, followed with a run-scoring hit.	Mat Latos retired 11 straight batters before Daniel Nava led off the seventh with a double. Xander Bogaerts snapped a 0-for-15 slump with an RBI single.	Latos gave up five hits and one run with one walk and five strikeouts in seven innings.	Kelly allowed five hits and two runs with three walks and four strikeouts in six innings as the Red Sox improved to 4-3 on their eight-game road trip.	LONG DROUGHT	Kelly's first career stolen base in the third inning was the first by a Boston pitcher since Bill Landis in 1969.	CUBAN CONNECTION	Cuban RHP Raisell Iglesias, 24, was in Cincinnati on Tuesday for the first time since signing a seven-year contract on June 27. Fellow Cubans and current Reds Brayan Pena and Aroldis Chapman encouraged Iglesias to sign with Cincinnati, he said.	UP NEXT	Red Sox: RHP Anthony Ranaudo makes his second major league appearance and first against a National League team when he starts at Cincinnati on Wednesday.	Reds: RHP Mike Leake makes his second start of the season against Boston on Wednesday. He left with a 3-2 lead but the Reds lost 4-3 at Fenway Park on May 7.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: Farrell is pleased with the progress shown by C David Ross and RF Allen Craig as they increase baseball activities. Both have been on the DL since August 2, Ross with right planter fasciitis and Craig with a left foot sprain.	Reds: RHP Homer Bailey's sore elbow prompted the Reds to push his next scheduled start from Wednesday against Boston to Saturday at Colorado.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

NEW YORK --  Michael Taylor's parents planned to come see him this weekend, so they missed his smashing start. At least the rookie had a proud souvenir to show them -- barely.	Taylor homered in his big league debut, setting off a silly sequence to retrieve the keepsake, and the Washington Nationals backed Doug Fister with four long shots Tuesday night in a 7-1 romp over the New York Mets.	"Definitely better than I imagined," Taylor said, his cell phone buzzing every few seconds with happy messages.	Bryce Harper homered early, then Anthony Rendon, Ian Desmond and Taylor connected in the sixth inning as the NL East leaders won their ninth straight at Citi Field.	Promoted from Triple-A over the weekend, Taylor singled in his first at-bat and later hit a two-run drive the opposite way at one of the majors' most spacious parks.	A ball boy ran out to right field to pick up Taylor's home run ball, but mistakenly tossed it to a young fan in the stands. Alerted to his error, the ball boy and a couple of security guards quickly worked out a trade of another ball to reclaim the prize.	Taylor said he heard about the scramble, but didn't see it. He admitted he was "kind of numb" standing at first base after his first hit, and was "just trying to breathe and relax and enjoy it" after his home run.	The balls from both moments were in his locker following the game.	Taylor finished 2 for 4. The 23-year-old outfielder hit a combined .315 with 22 homers and 35 stolen bases in the minors this season, almost all of it at Double-A.	Taylor got to start while star outfielder Jayson Werth got an MRI on his aching right shoulder. The team didn't have the results on that exam right after the game.	Fister (12-3) came back from a 25-minute rain delay and pitched seven shutout innings. He gave up seven hits, walked none and struck out three. Fister also hit a single for good measure after a 1-for-30 start at the plate this year.	"Doug throws what he wants when he wants and where he wants," Mets manager Terry Collins said. "When you go up there, especially when you're looking at our lineup four through nine, they're all pretty young, and he can carve you up and he does."	Fister sounded more excited about Taylor's performance than his own.	"He'll always remember Day 1," the veteran pitcher said, adding, "as a young guy, you've got to rag him a little bit."	Fister was on deck when Taylor homered. As Taylor passed by on the way back to the dugout, Fister wisecracked to him: "Oh, it's that easy, huh?"	Asdrubal Cabrera hit two doubles and a single as the Nationals improved to 23-4 at Citi Field dating to 2011. The only Washington starter who didn't get on base was leadoff man Denard Span, ending his 14-game hitting streak and his string of reaching safely at 36 games.	Rafael Montero (0-3) was tagged for three homers and five runs in five-plus innings. He was called up from Triple-A Las Vegas earlier in the day after impressive rookie Jacob deGrom went on the disabled list with rotator cuff tendinitis.	Mets star David Wright singled twice, giving him an 11-game hitting streak.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: Manager Matt Williams said Werth's shoulder was "inflamed and sore," yet added, "I don't think it's a DL situation."	UP NEXT	Fresh off his 200th career win, Mets RHP Bartolo Colon (11-9, 3.97) starts Wednesday night vs. Nationals RHP Jordan Zimmermann (7-5, 3.06). Desmond has tagged Colon, going 3 for 6 with two homers lifetime against him. Zimmermann is 1-1 in his last six starts.	DES-TINY	Desmond hit his 20th home run, the third straight year he's reached the mark. He connected as the Nats hit three homers in an inning for the first time since Sept. 5, 2012.	HOME AWAY FROM HOME	This was the fifth time that the Nationals have hit at least four home runs in a game at Citi Field, all in the last two seasons. The Mets have had a total of five games with at least four homers at Citi Field since the park opened in 2009.	STRIKE FORCE	Williams led the majors with 43 homers for the Giants on Aug. 12, 1994, when a players' strike started and wound up wiping out the rest of the season and the World Series. Williams was on a pace for nearly 61 home runs, which would've matched the then-record held by Roger Maris. Williams said the strike was painful at the time, but that the effects helped benefit the game in later years. As for his own chance at history, "To say I felt like I had a lost season isn't accurate," Williams said. So, does he think he would've reached 61? "I don't think so," he said. "No way."	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

MIAMI -- The drive down the left-field line took a surprising path, clanging off the foul pole for a homer by a batter who rarely hits them against a pitcher who rarely gives them up.	That narrow margin loomed large because of the way Jarred Cosart pitched against Adam Wainwright. Cosart went seven innings Tuesday to earn his first victory for the Miami Marlins, who beat Wainwright and the St. Louis Cardinals 3-0.	Wainwright (14-7) missed a chance to become the first 15-game winner in the majors. He went seven innings and allowed three runs, with two coming on a fourth-inning home run by Donovan Solano -- only the sixth homer allowed by the Cardinals' ace.	"I thought for sure the ball was going foul," Solano said.	He wasn't the only one.	"That ball was 10 feet foul and it came back fair. It was just the craziest ball flight I've ever seen," Wainwright said. "He thought it was foul, the umpire thought it was foul, I thought it was foul, everyone in the park thought it was foul. And then the ball started having this ball flight back to the pole, and it ended up hitting the pole. You can't do anything about that."	It was stunner coming against Wainwright, who began the game with the best innings-to-homers ratio among all major league starters. The homer was Solano's first ever at Marlins Park in 133 games.	His only other homer this year came against another All-Star, David Price.	"You can book Donovan for every ace in the league from here on out," Marlins manager Mike Redmond said with a giggle.	Cosart allowed three hits and one walk to win for the first time since July 7. The victory came in his second start for Miami after being acquired from Houston in a trade for prospects.	"I think that's why I got traded -- they had confidence in my ability that I can help this team," Cosart said. "I have the utmost confidence in my own ability that I can come in here and help these guys win games and help make a playoff push."	He's 1-1 with the Marlins and 10-7 overall this year.	Casey McGehee led off the Marlins' fourth and hustled for a double when left fielder Matt Holliday was slow getting the ball back into the infield. Jarrod Saltalamacchia singled home the game's first run, and Solano pulled an inside sinker for his homer.	"I think I got so caught up trying to stuff it in there that I didn't juice it like I wanted to," Wainwright said. "That may be why he got to it. You've got to tip your hat sometimes. It obviously looks ridiculously stupid that I gave up a two-run homer there, but the sad thing is it probably wouldn't have mattered because their guys pitched very good and we didn't score."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cosart, who missed his last turn because of a sore lower back, decided not to risk aggravating the injury at the plate. He took six strikes in two at-bats.	FIRST SAVE	With closer Steve Cishek given the night off, Mike Dunn came on with two on and two out in the ninth and earned his first save by retiring Matt Adams. The Marlins improved to 15-10 since the All-Star break.	MVP?	Marlins RF Giancarlo Stanton is aware of the buzz building that he deserves MVP consideration.	"You understand what the possibilities are," he said, "but I'm not typing MVP on Google every night."	Stanton came into the game tied for the major league lead with 31 home runs, and he led the NL in RBIs, total bases and walks. He walked twice but also grounded into two double plays.	UP NEXT	Justin Masterson, who got only six outs in his most recent outing, starts for the Cardinals against Nathan Eovaldi in the final game of the series Wednesday. Masterson has an 11.25 ERA in two starts since joining the Cardinals, but manager Mike Matheny said he was encouraged by the way the right-hander threw in his most recent bullpen session.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  All Adam Rosales had to do was watch four pitches miss their mark.	Tampa Bay's Cesar Ramos walked Rosales with two outs in the 14th inning to force in the winning run and the Texas Rangers beat the Rays 3-2 on Tuesday night.	Ramos (2-5), the Rays' seventh pitcher, walked Rosales on four pitches, allowing pinch-running pitcher Nick Martinez to score.	"That's just unacceptable on my part," Ramos said.	Texas' sixth pitcher, Scott Baker (1-3) earned the victory with two scoreless innings. The Rangers had lost all 20 games in which he appeared before Tuesday.	"Baker got the job done, and now he's got a win," Rangers manager Ron Washington said.	Geovany Soto reached on third baseman Evan Longoria's error with one out in the 14th. Martinez entered and advanced on singles by Rougned Odor and Shin-Soo Choo.	"I just kind of went off Elvis' (Andrus) at-bat," Rosales said. "He really didn't give Elvis too many good pitches to hit, so I figured `You've got to be really patient with this guy."	Rays manager Joe Maddon said, "Just throw a strike there. Give us a chance."	In contrast, Texas' pitchers allowed no walks.	Rangers starter Nick Tepesch allowed no hits until Sean Rodriguez singled to lead off the fifth inning.	Texas tied the score 2-all in the seventh against reliever Joel Peralta. Odor's sacrifice fly and a double by Choo drove in the runs.	Rays right fielder Kevin Kiermaier then threw out Choo trying to score on Andrus' single.	Desmond Jennings and Matt Joyce tripled and scored for the Rays' two runs in the sixth.	Tampa Bay's Jeremy Hellickson pitched six scoreless innings, allowing six hits. He preserved the Rays' 2-0 lead in the sixth after Texas put runners on second and third with one out.	Tepesch allowed four hits and no walks in seven innings. Texas' bullpen went another seven innings without allowing a walk -- and only two hits.	"Outstanding," Washington said. "The biggest one was (Roman) Mendez coming in and getting Longoria (with two out in the eighth)."	Said Rosales: "Thank goodness our pitching staff really kept us in it."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: RF Alex Rios (sprained right ankle) wasn't in the lineup for the second consecutive game, but pinch hit in the 13th inning. ... RHP Tanner Scheppers, out for the season with an inflamed elbow, said he would be a reliever next year.	Rays: Kiermaier, who left Monday's game because of tightness in his left lower back, returned to the lineup.	UP NEXT	The teams will play the third game of a four-game set Wednesday night.	Tampa Bay: RHP Chris Archer (7-6, 3.33) hasn't pitched in Arlington, and is 0-0 with a 2.77 career starts against Texas.	Rangers: RHP Miles Mikolas (1-4), who has lowered his ERA from 10.05 to 6.57 in his last four starts, will face the Rays for the first time.	SNAPPING A SLUMP	Texas CF Leonys Martin, hitless in his previous 12 at-bats, singled four times for his first career four-hit game. He had been 6-for-54 in his previous 16 games.	CHALLENGING	The Rays won a fifth-inning challenge and lost one in the 10th.	First, Martin was called safe on a slide at second base, but after review he was out. In the 10th, replay confirmed that Zobrist was out at first.	PERFECT ANNIVERSARY	Before the bottom of the second inning, Ivan Rodriguez represented the Rangers in recognizing retired LHP Kenny Rogers. He had the only perfect game in franchise history, on July 28, 1994. Rodriguez caught Rogers that night.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

CHICAGO --  Working quickly all night long, Kyle Hendricks pitched like a veteran. It's easy to see why the Chicago Cubs feel so comfortable when the rookie right-hander is on the mound.	Hendricks pitched 7 1/3 innings of six-hit ball in his third consecutive win, and Chicago cooled off Wily Peralta and the Milwaukee Brewers with a 3-0 victory on Tuesday.	"He threw really well," Cubs manager Rick Renteria said. "He repeated his outings in terms of execution, and the calmness he shows out there."	Hendricks struck out five and walked one, continuing an impressive opening run for his major league career. The right-hander is 4-1 with a 1.01 ERA in five starts since he got a no-decision in his debut at Cincinnati on July 10.	"Every time I'm going out there I just feel confident that I can make pitches," said Hendricks, who was acquired in the July 2012 trade that sent Ryan Dempster to Texas. "It grows each start, and it's going to keep growing hopefully."	Anthony Rizzo hit his 26th homer for Chicago, which had lost three of four. Arismendy Alcantara had two hits and drove in a run after going 1 for 14 through the first four games of the Cubs' seven-game homestand.	Trying for a major league-high 15th win, Peralta allowed three runs and seven hits in 6 1/3 innings. The right-hander had won each of his last five starts and was 10-1 with a 4.06 ERA in his previous 12 games coming into the night.	Peralta (14-7) has lost each of his three starts this season against last-place Chicago. He is 6-0 with a 1.10 ERA in seven games against the rest of the NL Central.	"For some reason, they put together good at-bats against me," Peralta said. "As a group, they're a young team and they have big league hitters. I think I'm gonna get another chance to face them and I just want to get a win."	The Cubs grabbed the lead on Justin Ruggiano's RBI single in the second, and Alcantara added another run-scoring single in the fourth. Alcantara's hit drove in Starlin Castro, who reached on a leadoff double to extend his hitting streak to 11 games, the best such streak for the Cubs this year.	Rizzo then led off the sixth with a towering drive to left for his first homer since July 22.	"It was supposed to be down and away and I got it up," Peralta said. "When you work behind this guy, he's a pretty good hitter and he's gonna make you pay for it."	Pedro Strop replaced Hendricks (4-1) with the bases loaded in the eighth and got Jonathan Lucroy to ground into an inning-ending double play. Hector Rondon then worked a perfect ninth for his 15th save in 19 chances.	The Brewers had won four of five. They had their NL Central lead trimmed to 1 1/2 games over Pittsburgh, which won 4-2 at Detroit.	Milwaukee center fielder Carlos Gomez made a great leaping grab on the warning track in the first, taking extra bases away from Javier Baez. Gomez then was hit by a pitch on his right wrist in the third, but stayed in the game.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: INFs Jean Segura and Scooter Gennett are playing with quad injuries. Manager Ron Roenicke said Segura is doing a lot better, but Gennett "is still a little bit limited."	Cubs: LHP Felix Doubront (strained left calf) struck out seven while pitching four-plus innings in his first rehab appearance with Triple-A Iowa. He was charged with three runs and four hits. ... Castro said he tweaked his left knee, but should be fine. ... Ruggiano was removed after seven innings due to "leg fatigue," Renteria said.	UP NEXT	Brewers RHP Kyle Lohse (11-6, 3.33 ERA) and Cubs LHP Tsuyoshi Wada (1-1, 3.25 ERA) are slated to start the third game of the series Wednesday night. Lohse is 2-0 with a 1.69 ERA in two starts against Chicago this season, including a three-hitter in a 9-0 victory on June 1. Wada is making his first appearance against Milwaukee and his sixth career start overall.	---	Jay Cohen can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/jcohenap	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The Oakland Athletics' combination of Jon Lester and Josh Donaldson was too much for the Kansas City Royals.	Lester pitched six strong innings and Donaldson homered twice and drove in four runs as the Athletics won 11-3 Tuesday night, snapping the Royals' eight-game winning streak.	Lester (13-7) has won all three of his starts since joining the A's in a trade from Boston in a deadline deal on July 31 that sent All-Star outfielder Yoenis Cespedes to the Red Sox. Lester struck out nine and allowed three runs on six hits and two walks.	The timing of the trade was bad for the Royals, having to face Lester twice in 10 days.	"I'd rather face Cespedes four times in a game than face Lester one game," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "That's just me. That's not taking anything away from Cespedes. He can beat you with one swing of the bat."	The Royals have won 11 of 13, with both losses coming against Lester -- who improved to 9-3 with a 1.84 ERA in 13 career starts against Kansas City.	Donaldson homered in the seventh and eighth off left-hander Bruce Chen for his third multihomer game of the season. He also added an RBI double in the first and a sacrifice fly in the fifth.	"It helps when you have contributors up and down the lineup," Donaldson said. "We believe that it's going to happen more times than not. We had some balls that were hit hard for outs, and then we had a lot of balls that fell in for us tonight."	Brandon Moss had four hits, matching his career high, as the A's finished with a season-high 20 hits.	"He looked like Wade Boggs up there," A's manager Bob Melvin said.	Royals starter Jeremy Guthrie (8-10) allowed six runs on 11 hits in 4 2/3 innings.	"Obviously, we would have loved to gone out there and had a better performance from myself and the pitchers to keep us in the game," Guthrie said. "We play 162 of these and you take them for what it's worth. They strung together a bunch of hits and they had a tough pitcher and won the game."	Salvador Perez and Lorenzo Cain doubled in the Royals' three-run fifth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: SS Jed Lowrie has a fractured right index finger, which was detected by a MRI Tuesday. He injured it Aug. 4 and it was originally believed to be a bruise as an X-ray showed no break. Lowrie, who played four days with it, is hopeful he can avoid the disabled list, but may need extra days off.	Royals: LHP Scott Downs went on the DL with a stiff neck.	ON DECK	Athletics: LHP Scott Kazmir goes Wednesday. He has held opposing batters to a major league best .071 average with runners in scoring position and two out.	Royals: LHP Jason Vargas has not walked a batter at home in 26 1/3 innings since an intentional pass to Yadier Molina on June 4.	OUT OF A SLUMP	Moss was in a 5-for-46 skid before collecting four hits against the Royals. Moss has four RBIs in the first two games of this series after driving in just one run in his previous 14 games.	COOKING UP ZEROES	A's reliever Ryan Cook tossed a perfect seventh to extend his scoreless streak to 20 innings, the longest active streak in the majors.	BEHIND EARLY	When the A's scored in the first inning, it was the first time in 44 innings the Royals had trailed. The A's are 48-11 when scoring first. The A's 20 hits were a season-high against Kansas City pitching.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

HOUSTON --  Chris Carter has been the hottest hitter in the majors since July 1.	Houston's slugger is certainly happy with his recent streak but wishes he'd been able to get on track earlier in the season.	"I feel like I can do more," he said. "Like I can do this the whole season instead of just a little part of the season."	Carter homered twice and matched a career high with five RBIs to lead the Astros over the Minnesota Twins 10-4 on Tuesday night.	The game was tied in the third inning when Carter's two-out, two-run drive to the Crawford Boxes in left field put Houston up 3-1.	Carter connected again on his next at-bat with a three-run shot in the fifth which chased Minnesota rookie starter Yohan Pino (1-5).	Carter leads the majors with 15 homers since July 1 and his six multihomer games this season ties a franchise record set by Lance Berkman in 2006. Tuesday was his second multi-homer game in a week and his 28 home runs are third in the American League and just one shy of his total in 2013.	His recent streak has upped his batting average to .230 from a season-low .181 on July 1. He's powered the Astros offense while starters George Springer and Dexter Fowler have been on the disabled list.	"He had it in spurts last year," Porter said. "So you would say to yourself, `At some point, when it all comes together and everything clicks and we start to get consistency to this, it can be scary.' And that's what we're seeing right now."	Carter insists he hasn't changed anything and that things have simply started clicking for him. Despite hitting .350 this month, he still believes he can improve.	"I feel like there's still more to be done and I'm not just going to settle with this right now and just sit right here," he said.	Collin McHugh (5-9) allowed four hits and a run in six innings for the win.	Oswaldo Arcia homered twice for the Twins for his first career multihomer game. He gave Minnesota a 1-0 lead in the second inning and added a two-run shot in the ninth.	Jake Marisnick, who finished with two hits, tied it with a solo homer to start Houston's third before Carter's first home run put Houston on top.	Minnesota's Joe Mauer singled in the first to extend his hitting streak to a season-high 14 games in his second game back from the disabled list.	Pino allowed a season-high seven runs on seven hits in 4 1/3 innings for his third straight loss.	"We just didn't pitch well enough (Tuesday)," Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said. "They made us pay every time we made a bad pitch in some bad situations."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Minnesota: RHP Ricky Nolasco (elbow) is scheduled to come off the disabled list to start for the Twins on Friday. Gardenhire said they'll likely limit him to 80-85 pitches.	Houston: Manager Bo Porter said CF Dexter Fowler (back) will come off the DL and start on Wednesday. Fowler hasn't played since June 26. Fellow outfielder George Springer (quadriceps) had a setback in his rehabilitation and will be shut down for two weeks. Springer has been out since July 19.	UP NEXT	Houston LHP Brett Oberholtzer opposes Kyle Gibson. The Astros have won the last five games started by Oberholtzer. Gibson pitched seven scoreless inning in a win over the Astros on June 7.	SOME KIND OF LUCK	Tim Pinkard went from having never caught a home run ball to grabbing two of them on Tuesday night. Pinkard, who was visiting from Washington, D.C., caught both of Carter's homers. Decked out in Astros' gear, a beaming Pinkard raised his hands with a ball in each of them after snagging the second one. He texted his wife to tell her what happened and she didn't believe him until he sent pictures. "I wanted to sit in the Crawford Boxes because I know it's one of the intricacies of this park, and I knew a lot of home runs get hit here," Pinkard said. "I knew this was home run territory, but I honestly didn't expect to catch anything."	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Whatever had been bottling up the Los Angeles Angels' offense finally got dislodged during one remarkable inning.	Kole Calhoun homered and had an RBI single during a seven-run sixth, and the Angels' struggling offense rebounded for a 7-2 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Tuesday night.	David Freese had a two-run double during the lengthy rally, which propelled Los Angeles to just its second win in seven games. Calhoun bookended the rally with two of his three hits for the Angels, who had scored just nine runs in the previous 61 innings for a club that led the majors in scoring at the All-Star break.	"It's nice to bust out like that, and it hopefully gets us rolling," said Calhoun, who has four straight multihit games. "This is a talented offense up and down. It's going to turn around."	Calhoun sneaked his first homer since July 20 inside the right-field pole leading off the sixth, and Howie Kendrick drove home Albert Pujols with a tying single off Antonio Bastardo (5-6).	Marlon Byrd then badly overran pinch-hitter Collin Cowgill's fly down the line, allowing it to bounce behind him for a ground-rule double.	"I think the wall came into play there," Philadelphia manager Ryne Sandberg said. "He had to go so far and it was sneaking up on him. It's right up there in the corner, not much room. It was a tough spot for him."	Chris Iannetta and Calhoun capped the rally with two-out RBI singles.	The Angels made it comfortable for C.J. Wilson (9-8), who pitched into the seventh inning of his first victory since June 24, yielding seven hits and two walks. He was winless in his last five starts, with an injury absence in the middle.	"It's still not there," Wilson said. "I was just trying to control the rhythm of the game and not overthrow it."	Jerome Williams pitched five-hit ball into the sixth inning of his Phillies debut, but the former Angels right-hander's bullpen couldn't hold back his old teammates.	Williams was resilient in his first start for his seventh major league team. Philadelphia picked him up off waivers Sunday from Texas. He spent the past three seasons with the Angels, revitalizing his major league career.	"I don't think that it's like an audition or anything like that," Williams said. "All I'm thinking about is going out there and performing, and whatever the team wants me to do, I'll do."	Byrd and Ryan Howard drove in early runs for the last-place Phillies, who dropped to 4-9 in interleague play after allowing their second-worst single inning of the season.	The Angels (69-49) bounced back from a week of mostly miserable hitting. After reaching the All-Star break as the majors' top-scoring team, they had managed nearly two fewer runs per game since the break, undermining their chances of catching Oakland atop the AL West.	RARE TRIP	The Phillies visited Anaheim for the first time since 2003, and they're likely grateful they don't make it to the Big A regularly. Philadelphia has lost eight straight to the Angels over the last 12 seasons, getting outscored 37-14 by a team known as the Anaheim Angels back when the streak started. The skid is the Phillies' longest against any opponent.	TROUT CAUGHT	Not everything went well in the sixth for the Angels. Mike Trout struck out twice, extending his 4-for-25 homestand struggles. He has high-priced company, too: Josh Hamilton is in a 2-for-23 slump on this homestand, while Pujols is 5 for 26.	TRAINER'S ROOM:	Angels: Reliever Mike Morin threw a bullpen session. He could return from the disabled list Saturday.	UP NEXT:	Phillies: A.J. Burnett (6-12, 4.29) starts the series finale.	Angels: Jered Weaver (12-7, 3.68) pitches two days after his daughter's birth.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SEATTLE -- When the Mariners arrived back in Seattle for an important nine-game homestand, they knew if they wanted to stay in the playoff conversation they could no longer be underachievers at home.	After winning seven of eight, the Mariners are more than in the conversation. They are over .500 at home and tied with Detroit for the second wild-card spot in the American League.	Kyle Seager and Kendrys Morales hit solo home runs, Dustin Ackley added a key two-out two-run single, and the Mariners beat the Toronto Blue Jays 6-3 on Tuesday night.	"It's awesome. It's a whole new ballgame when it means something and you get in here and you're pumped and you look and see what everyone else is doing and where you stand," Ackley said. "It's a lot more fun. Baseball is always fun but it makes it that much more enjoyable when you're actually in it."	Seattle (64-55) matched its season high of nine games over .500, getting another solid performance from veteran Chris Young, who earned his 11th victory. The Mariners also continued their recent offensive punch.	Seager's 18th homer gave Seattle a 2-1 lead in the fourth. Ackley followed an inning later, going to the opposite field to drive in a pair.	Morales capped the night with his first homer since being acquired by the Mariners in a trade with Minnesota in late July. It was Morales' first homer since June 24, snapping a career-high, 41-game drought without a long ball.	"The one thing we talked about coming home off the road is we need to start protecting our house," Seattle manager Lloyd McClendon said. "We just had not been very good at home. I think the guys were conscious of that."	Young (11-6) pitched six strong innings, allowing just two hits. He yielded a first-inning run after walking Jose Reyes on four pitches and giving up Melky Cabrera's RBI double to start the game. Young retired 14 straight after Cabrera's double, the streak snapped when Juan Francisco doubled in the fifth.	Young struck out three and walked two, and won his third straight decision.	Charlie Furbush got four outs with ease but Brandon Maurer gave up three hits in the eighth, capped by Jose Bautista's RBI double. Toronto added another run on Nolan Reimold's sacrifice fly, but Francisco Rodney pitched the ninth for his 33rd save.	Logan Morrison extended his hitting streak to 13 games, with a single in the third, and scored on Austin Jackson's hit-and-run single that Colby Rasmus misplayed in center field. Morrison doubled in the fifth, but was caught in a rundown between third and home on Jackson's grounder. Morrison stayed in the rundown long enough for Chris Taylor and Jackson to get into scoring position, and Ackley plated both with a single to left field on a pitch he probably would have missed earlier in the season.	"It came down to Ackley's hit right there," Toronto manager John Gibbons said. "They have a good pitching staff and we have to score for ours."	Toronto starter J.A. Happ (8-7) gave up seven hits and struck out only one in six innings after recording 12 strikeouts in his last start.	MR. 400	McClendon earned his 400th career win as a manager. He was presented the game ball by Robinson Cano in the clubhouse and then was showered by his players in celebration.	THREE OR LESS	Seattle extended its club record with an 11th straight game giving up three runs or less. Seattle is 8-3 during the stretch with a staff ERA of 1.93.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: Adam Lind (foot) was activated off the 15-day disabled list and batted fourth. Lind went hitless in three at bats.	Mariners: LHP Roenis Elias was optioned to the minors recently in an effort to control his innings. Elias will throw a few innings later this week at Triple-A Tacoma and likely rejoin the Seattle rotation next week in Philadelphia.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays: RHP R.A. Dickey (9-11) got a no decision in his last start against Detroit despite allowing just two earned runs. Dickey's last win came on July 28 against Boston.	Mariners: RHP Hisashi Iwakuma (10-6) is looking to continue a strong stretch. Over his last eight starts, Iwakuma is 5-2 with a 2.04 ERA and he has pitched at least seven innings in his past seven starts.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN DIEGO --  With as many pitches Odrisamer Despainge throws, sometimes he forgets about the most basic one: a fastball.	Not Tuesday night.	Despainge leaned on it in helping the San Diego Padres to a 4-1 win over the Colorado Rockies.	By limiting his assortment of off-speed offerings he won for the first time in over a month.	"His stuff is pretty good," San Diego manager Bud Black said. "He got back to stuff instead of deception."	Despaigne pitched five-hit ball for seven innings, leading the Padres to their fourth straight win. Despaigne (3-3) struck out eight and walked two for San Diego, which has won 10 of 13.	Chris Nelson drove in two runs in the eighth inning for the Padres.	Alexi Amarista and Abraham Almonte also drove in runs. Yasmani Grandal had two of the Padres' six hits.	The Padres fielded a starting lineup with seven players from Latin America for the first time in franchise history.	Yohan Flande (0-5) went six innings and gave up four hits and two runs as Colorado lost for the fifth time in six games.	It was Despaigne's first win since June 29 against Arizona, when he won in the second of his first two major league starts.	"He had better use of the fastball and threw it with a little more convention and that set up the other pitches," Black said. "That is something we talked about in between starts. That was great to see that he took a pitching plan and into the ballgame and executed it based on our conversation of fundamental pitching."	Despaigne allowed 10 runs in his last two outings before rebounding against Colorado, the major's worst road team at 18-43 and worst overall at 46-73.	"In the big leagues, hitters make adjustment if they see a guy doesn't have command with the fastball, they are not going to swing at the breaking ball," Despaigne said through a translator. "Today I threw all the pitches for the strikes and I was aggressive with fastball."	Colorado's run came on Corey Dickerson's ninth-inning homer, his third in three games.	"He had good stuff and kept a lot of people off balance tonight," Dickerson said.	Almonte put the Padres up 2-0 in the fourth when his sacrifice fly scored Rymer Liriano. Liriano reached on his first major league hit -- an infield single.	The Padres opened the scoring in the second when Yonder Alonso scored on Amarista's fielder's choice.	Alonso left in the fourth with a right forearm strain and was to undergo an MRI.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: SS Everth Cabrera was placed on the disabled list, retroactive to Sunday, with a strained left hamstring. . RHP Andrew Cashner, who's been on the DL since June 21 with a sore right shoulder, is scheduled to make two rehab starts for Triple-A El Paso. Black said Cashner will be limited to four innings/60 pitches in the Wednesday's outing. On Monday, Cashner will be extended to five innings/75-80 pitches.	Rockies: LHP Brett Anderson, who's been on the disabled list since Aug. 6, will undergo surgery on Thursday to repair a disk in his lower back. Manager Walt Weiss said he expected Anderson to be ready for spring training.	UP NEXT	Rockies: LHP Tyler Matzek (2-7, 3.52 ERA) will be looking to snap a three-game losing streak in making his first appearance at Petco Park.	Padres: RHP Ian Kennedy (8-10, 3.51), who lost his last time out, at Pittsburgh, has gone at least six innings in 18 of his 24 starts this season.	OLD TRICK	When Liriano got his first major league hit, the ball was flipped to the Padres' dugout for safekeeping. Hitting coach Alonzo Powell retrieved the memento and quickly flipped a decoy baseball he had stashed in his pocket into the crowd as a bewildered Liriano looked on.	YO, FLANDE HITS	Flande reached on his first two plate appearances, with the second one resulting in his first major league hit. It wasn't clear if Flande was fooled like Liriano, but he had this in common with Liriano: both of the first-time hits were of the infield variety.	MULTIPLE MORNEAU	Justin Morneau had a multihit outing for the sixth straight game, which ties a career high. Morneau was 2 for 3 with a walk.	27,188 PLUS 2	Right after the night's attendance was announced, two more people entered the stands. Nelson made a great catch of a pop fly in the eighth inning while falling into the stands. That was followed by 1B Tommy Medica doing likewise in the seats behind first base.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Chris Sale wasn't too upset that the White Sox blew a two-run lead in the ninth inning, costing the All-Star left-hander a sure win. He's kind of getting used to it.	If anything, he seemed a bit giddy after Gordon Beckham's game-winning hit in the 10th inning.	Beckham's two-out RBI single helped lift Chicago to a 3-2 win over the San Francisco Giants on Tuesday night.	Sale struck out 12 in eight solid innings but left with his seventh no-decision of the season.	"Anytime you leave a game like that you want to win but we ended up winning," said Sale, who allowed four hits over eight scoreless innings. "It's not who gets it, it's how we get it."	One batter after Jordan Danks was thrown out trying to score from third on a fielder's choice, Beckham hit an 0-1 pitch from San Francisco reliever Santiago Casilla (1-2) past shortstop Brandon Crawford into left field. Sierra, who entered the game as a late defensive replacement, scored easily.	Beckham had made two stellar defensive plays including one in the ninth before he bailed out the White Sox bullpen with his only hit in five at-bats.	"I guess I didn't give in and was able to eke out that last hit," said Beckham, who was hitting just .136 over his previous 30 games. "I'll get satisfaction out of anything positive after my last couple months."	Zach Putnam (4-2) pitched 1 1/3 innings for the win while Adam Dunn hit a two-run home run in the first for Chicago, which wasted another strong start by Sale when reliever Jake Petricka gave up four hits in the ninth.	Pablo Sandoval, Mike Morse and pinch-hitter Travis Ishikawa singled to load the base with no outs in the ninth. Joe Panik grounded into a 4-6-3 double play to score Sandoval before Crawford's two-out single tied it.	It wasn't enough to keep San Francisco from falling a season-high six games behind the Dodgers in the AL West. The Giants led the division by 9 1/2 games on June 8 but have gone just 20-36 since.	Before their rally in the ninth, the Giants hadn't done much at all.	Hunter Pence tripled with one out in the first but was thrown out by White Sox shortstop Alexei Ramirez while trying to score on Buster Posey's fielder's choice. Ramirez's throw home was wide but Pence had to leap over Posey's bat which was lying across the base path. That gave catcher Tyler Flowers just enough time to make the tag.	"I had to dodge the bat and couldn't slide right in, but it didn't affect the outcome of the play," Pence said. "I was going to that side to avoid the tag anyway."	HOME SWEET HOME?	San Francisco has sold out 306 consecutive games at AT&T Park, the longest such streak in the majors. But the Giants are just 7-22 in their past 29 games at the waterfront ballpark, a major reason they've fallen out of contention.	BULLPEN BLUES	The White Sox won despite the bullpen blowing a save for the 18th time this season, tied with the Pirates for third most in the majors.	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox: RHP Matt Lindstrom was reinstated from the disabled list for the first time since undergoing surgery on May 23 to repair a torn sheath in his left foot. Lindstrom (2-1, six saves) pitched in five games on his rehab assignment. He takes the roster spot of LHP Eric Surkamp, who was optioned to Triple-A Charlotte on Sunday.	Giants: RHP Matt Cain underwent season-ending surgery to remove bone chips in his pitching elbow. Recovery is expected to take three months of rehabilitation. ... C Hector Sanchez (concussion) has resumed his rehab with Triple-A Fresno.	NEXT UP	White Sox: LHP Jose Quintana (6-8), who has one loss over his previous 10 starts, makes his first career appearance against San Francisco in the final half of this brief two-game series.	Giants: RHP Jake Peavey, winless in three starts with the Giants, allowed one run over six innings against Chicago on April 15 when he was still with Boston.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

CINCINNATI --  Mike Napoli had the perfect scenario. He didn't waste it.	Napoli hit a two-run homer and drove in three runs to help the Boston Red Sox wrap up their first winning road trip of more than three games this season with a 5-4 win over the Cincinnati Reds on Wednesday.	"It was nice to have a winning road trip," the Boston first baseman said. "We're playing better baseball. I thought there were a couple more games we could've had."	Napoli took advantage of a 2-0 fastball from Reds starter Mike Leake in a ballpark known for yielding home runs.	"He got a fastball down and away, and he's a pretty good opposite-field hitter," Red Sox manager John Farrell said. "In this ballpark, that's a decisive combination."	Right-hander Anthony Ranaudo became the first Boston rookie to start his career 2-0 since Justin Masterson won his first three in 2008 and the Red Sox finished their eight-game trip with five wins.	Skip Schumaker and Cincinnati starting pitcher Mike Leake each hit their second home runs of the season, but the Reds still ended their seven-game home stand with a 3-4 record after opening by sweeping a two-game interleague series against in-state rival Cleveland.	"It is certainly frustrating," Schumaker said. "Mike gives us a chance to win every time out. It would have been nice to give him a chance or take him off the hook."	Burke Badenhop and Junichi Tazawa each pitched one perfect inning before Edward Mujica overcame back-to-back leadoff singles in the ninth for his third save.	Schumaker and Leake each hit solo home runs in the bottom of the fourth to give the Reds a 3-2 lead. The Red Sox immediately responded with two outs in the fifth on Yoenis Cespedes' RBI single and Napoli's 361-foot, opposite-field homer to right, his 15th homer of the season and second of the trip.	Ranaudo allowed eight hits and four runs with one walk and one strikeout in six innings.	Leake (9-11) lasted five innings, his shortest outing in 11 starts since going five innings on June 15 at Milwaukee. He allowed eight hits and five runs with one walk and three strikeouts.	Boston reached Leake for two runs with just one hit in the first. Leake's wild pitch set up Daniel Nava's RBI single, and Nava later scored on Napoli's slow grounder to third baseman Todd Frazier, whose throw home was too late to get the runner.	FINALLY	Boston CF Jackie Bradley Jr. snapped a 0-for-35 slump with a second-inning single.	OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS	Boston is 24-23 in one-run games. The Red Sox were tied with Miami for the most one-run decisions in the majors going into Wednesday's games. The Reds slipped to 17-28 after going 27-22 last season.	DANGEROUS BAT	Leake's home run was the fourth of his career and raised his career hit total to 65, more than any major league pitcher since his debut in 2010.	UP NEXT	Red Sox: RHP Allen Webster makes his first career start against Houston on Thursday as Boston opens its second 11-game home stand of the season.	Reds: RHP Alfredo Simon takes a 0.00 ERA in 3 2/3 innings over three games at Coors Field into his first career start on Thursday in Colorado, where the Reds open a seven-game road trip.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: Cespedes left the game after six innings with a right hand contusion after Farrell said he got jammed in his last at bat.	Reds: RF Jay Bruce was scratched from the Reds' original starting lineup due to illness. ... RHP Logan Ondrusek and 2B Brandon Phillips are scheduled to begin rehabilitation assignments with Triple-A Louisville on Friday.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

HOUSTON --  On a day when he had everything going, the only thing that frustrated Minnesota pitcher Kyle Gibson was he had to leave the game.	The Twins' right-hander was dominant in a 3-1 win against the Houston Astros, allowing six hits and one run in 7 2/3 innings on Wednesday.	Gibson, who struck out four and walked two, took a shutout into the eighth before Chris Carter drove home Jose Altuve with s single.	"It's never too frustrating when you win a game but I definitely wanted it that's for sure," Gibson said. "That last inning I knew every pitch was important to keep the pitch count down and be able to go back out there for the ninth.	"That infield single that just didn't get hit hard enough and a bloop that just didn't get hit hard enough cost me the opportunity."	Gibson (11-9) was well under 100 pitches going into the inning and nursing a 3-0 lead thanks to a sixth inning home run by Joe Mauer and a two-run RBI single in the seventh by Kennys Vargas.	"I was sitting right there with him," said Twins manager Ron Gardenhire. "I said `If he gets through the eighth inning under 100 pitches we let him go back out there and take a shot at it. He's earned that.' Unfortunately they got a run on him and we had to get him out of there. I was thinking right along with him. I thought he was in control of the game."	Mauer gave Gibson some cushion when he hit a 2-2 pitch into the right field bullpen in the sixth inning to break up a scoreless tie.	Mauer, who extended his hitting streak to 15 games with a first inning single, drove the Brett Oberholtzer (4-8) pitch on a line to give the Twins a 1-0 lead.	"I'd like to have that back," Oberholtzer said of the pitch Mauer hit out. "Hindsight's 20-20 but it's a two-two count and I challenge there with nobody on to start the inning and he made me pay for it."	Glen Perkins pitched a perfect ninth inning to earn his 30th save of the season.	Oberholtzer pitched well over seven innings. The left-hander allowed six hits and struck out four.	"Oberholtzer threw the ball well, "Astros manager Bo Porter said. "He did a tremendous job, and offensively we didn't swing the bats. So he ends up being the tough luck loser."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: First baseman Jesus Guzman will begin a rehab assignment Thursday with Triple-A Oklahoma City. Guzman was placed on the 15-day disabled list August 3rd with back spasms.	Twins: Ricky Nolasco is on schedule to make his first start since going on the disabled list July 8th after a second successful rehab outing August 10th. Gardenhire said after the game that right-hander Anthony Swarzak sprained his ankle on the last pitch of Tuesday 10-4 Astros win. The manager said the pitcher is day-to-day.	UP NEXT	Astros: Scott Feldman will look to extend his August win streak to three against Boston Thursday against Red Sox right-hander Allen Webster.	Twins: After two rehab starts, Nolasco is scheduled to come off the disabled list Friday to face Kansas City and will be looking for his third win against the Royals in 2014.	MAUER AND OBERHOLTZER CONTINUE STREAKS	Mauer's hitting streak is one shy of his career high of 16.  Oberholtzer's streak of quality starts is four.	FOWLER RETURNS TO LINEUP	Dexter Fowler was back in the Astros lineup for the first time since June 26th and went 1-for-4 with a walk and a single. The club optioned Domingo Santana to Triple-A to make room for his return.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Depending on the clubhouse, the response to the latest overturned call at home under baseball's expanded replay system was as debatable as the rule itself.	The Giants scored seven runs in the seventh inning after the replay official overturned an out call at home because they said Chicago catcher Tyler Flowers illegally blocked Gregor Blanco's path to the plate, and San Francisco went on to beat the White Sox 7-1 on Wednesday.	"We'll take it," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said.	With one out in the inning, first baseman Jose Abreu fielded Joe Panik's broken-bat grounder to throw out Blanco by at least six feet. Bochy challenged the play, and umpires ruled Flowers' left leg was illegally blocking the plate before the ball arrived.	White Sox manager Robin Ventura argued the call and was immediately ejected, setting off an epic protest in which he repeatedly kicked dirt on the plate.	"If you look at the spirit of the rule of what they are trying to do and what it's actually doing it's a joke," said Ventura, who unsuccessfully challenged a similar call at the plate in Chicago's 3-2 win Tuesday night in San Francisco. "They don't take into consideration that the guy was out by a longshot."	San Francisco snapped a five-game losing streak as Jake Peavy (1-3) won for the first time since April 25 with Boston. Peavy had lost 12 consecutive decisions, the longest skid of his career.	Peavy's friend and former White Sox teammate, Jose Quintana (6-9), took the loss.	"Catching those breaks, feels like I haven't caught one on my day with any team I've pitched for," Peavy said.	Adam Dunn hit his 19th homer of the season into McCovey Cove in the fourth for Chicago's only run. It was one of just four hits Peavy allowed in seven innings.	Peavy even changed his uniform number from 43 to 22, which he wore for his high school in Mobile, Alabama. He wore 44 with the San Diego Padres, White Sox and Boston Red Sox.	Perhaps the new look changed his luck.	San Francisco took advantage of the new rule, 7.13, that prohibits catchers from blocking the plate until possessing the ball so runners don't barrel into them. The rule gained traction after Giants catcher Buster Posey's gruesome injury in May 2011 ended his season blocking the same plate at AT&T Park.	Blanco said Flowers was "definitely" blocking the plate but admitted it's a tough call. Flowers believes replay officials need to have some flexibility when they make the decision.	"Apparently they are interpreting this extremely black and white with no context," Flowers said.	The review lasted 4 minutes and 55 seconds, and umpires also allowed Adam Duvall to advance from first to third. But even after being ejected, Ventura came back out to challenge that decision. The play was reviewed again, and umpires told Duvall to go back to second.	Angel Pagan added a two-out, two-run single, and Hunter Pence and Posey each hit RBI singles. The Giants scored two more runs when center fielder Jordan Danks and Dunn also got tangled up in right-center going for Pablo Sandoval's fly.	Quintana was charged with four runs and four hits in 6 2/3 innings. Reliever Ronald Belisario was tagged for three runs, one earned, and three hits without recording an out.	DUNN'S DINGER	It was the second time this season Dunn homered off Peavy. The pitcher said if anybody was going to take him deep, he was glad it was his friend. "But I'm sure I'll have to hear about it," Peavy said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox: Pitching coach Don Cooper, who did not make the road trip because of a recurrence of vertigo-like symptoms, is expected to rejoin the team in Chicago on Friday.	Giants: Backup C Hector Sanchez (concussion) was scheduled to start behind the plate Wednesday with Triple-A Fresno for the first time during his rehab assignment.	NEXT UP	White Sox: After a day off Thursday, RHP Hector Noesi (6-8, 4.67 ERA) starts the opener of a three-game home series against Toronto on Friday.	Giants: The team has a day off Thursday before LHP Madison Bumgarner (13-9, 3.22) takes the mound in the opener of a three-game series against Philadelphia on Friday.

CLEVELAND -- Zach Walters' one-out homer in the ninth inning gave the Cleveland Indians a 3-2 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks in the first game of a doubleheader on Wednesday.	Walters, acquired at the trade deadline from Washington for Asdrubal Cabrera, hit a 1-2 pitch from Randall Delgado (1-3) that narrowly cleared the wall in right field.	Walters was called up from Triple-A Columbus on Sunday when outfielder David Murphy and designated hitter Nick Swisher went on the disabled list with injuries. The home run was the fourth of his career.	Cody Allen (4-2) worked around a two-out walk in the ninth.	Trevor Bauer, pitching against the team that took him with the third pick of the 2011 draft, allowed two runs and struck out nine in a career-high eight innings.	Bauer didn't allow a hit until the sixth when Arizona scored to break a scoreless tie. Michael Brantley's two-run single put Cleveland ahead in the bottom of the inning, but the Diamondbacks tied the game in the seventh on Aaron Hill's RBI groundout.	Bauer faced the minimum 15 batters through five innings before running into problems in the sixth. Jake Lamb drew a leadoff walk before Xavier Paul lined a clean single to right, putting runners on first and third. Lamb scored when Jordan Pacheco hit into a double play.	Bauer clashed with both Arizona management and teammates, leading to a short tenure with the Diamondbacks. The right-hander was 1-2 with a 6.06 ERA in four starts for Arizona in 2012 and was traded to the Indians in December.	Vidal Nuno retired the first eight hitters, striking out five, before Tyler Holt recorded his first major league hit, a two-out single in the third.	Nuno allowed two runs in 5 2/3 innings.	Tuesday night's game was postponed in the top of the fourth after a 3 hour, 40 minute rain delay, forcing the team to play a doubleheader. The Diamondbacks announced Tuesday that left-hander Andrew Chafin would make his major league debut in the first game, but manager Kirk Gibson opted to go with Nuno.	Chafin is the scheduled starter in Game 2 against Cleveland's Josh Tomlin.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: OF A.J. Pollock (broken right hand) is expected to resume his rehabilitation assignment at Triple-A Reno over the weekend. Pollock returned to Phoenix after being hit by a pitch on the same hand during his rehab debut in the Class A Arizona League, but tests showed no additional damage.	Indians: DH Nick Swisher (sore right knee) will be examined by Dr. Neal S. ElAttrache, the team physician for the Dodgers, on Tuesday in Los Angeles. A determination on whether Swisher needs surgery could be made at that time.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: After the doubleheader, Arizona continues its 10-game road trip with a four-game series in Miami on Thursday. Arizona RHP Chase Anderson (7-4) takes on RHP Brad Penny (1-0). Anderson is unbeaten in his past five starts, posting a 2-0 record with a 1.74 ERA over 31 innings.	Indians: Cleveland is off Thursday, but continues its five-game homestand Friday against Baltimore. Cleveland RHP Corey Kluber (13-6) faces LHP Wei-Yin Chen (12-4). Kluber is tied for the American League lead in wins and ranks third with a 2.46 ERA and 187 strikeouts.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

SAN DIEGO --  In his third big league game, Rymer Liriano showed off his raw power in one of the more impressive ways possible at Petco Park.	Liriano's first big league homer was a two-run shot that helped the San Diego Padres beat the Colorado Rockies 5-3 Wednesday to tie their season-high with their fifth straight win. It traveled an estimated 427 feet and landed in the top deck of the Western Metal Supply Co. brick warehouse in the left-field corner.	"It felt great," said Liriano, who was promoted from Triple-A El Paso on Monday. "I felt excited when I crushed the homer."	That, he did. It was the 14th homer hit to the top balcony of the Western Metal building since Petco opened in 2004, and the eighth by a Padres player.	"Third level Western Metal, that's always a good one," manager Bud Black said. "I like the fact he got to an inside fastball. The Rockies the first two days got him with some fastballs in. He turned on that one. We know that he's got the raw power. That showed up today on a fastball from a pitcher that was pitching inside pretty effectively all day. That was good to see."	Said Liriano: "I feel really comfortable when I get a fastball in. I'm excited. Some people say I don't ever hit a fastball in. I feel really good right now to hit a fastball."	Abraham Almonte also homered and Jedd Gyorko tied his career-high with four hits. The Padres are 16-8 since the All-Star break, including winning 11 of 14. The Padres swept a series for the third time this year, all at home.	The Rockies, who have the worst record in the majors at 18-44, struck out 13 times against Ian Kennedy (9-10) and four relievers, giving them 66 in their last six games.	"We've been striking out entirely too much lately," manager Walt Weiss said. "It's about competing when you get to two strikes."	Liriano's shot came off left-hander Tyler Matzek (2-8) and gave San Diego a 3-1 lead. Chris Nelson was aboard on a leadoff single.	Almonte homered to left with one out in the sixth, his first since being acquired in a trade with Seattle on July 31.	"The one to Liriano, I thought it was a good pitch," Matzek said. "He turned on it. It looked like he was sitting on that pitch. The one to Almonte, I was trying to go away and left it over the middle. That was probably a mistake pitch. He made me pay for it."	Kennedy struck out eight in six innings while allowing three runs and six hits, with two walks. Joaquin Benoit pitched the ninth for his seventh save in eight chances.	The Rockies tied it the score 3-3 in the fourth with a leadoff homer to left by DJ LeMahieu, his fourth, and an RBI double to left by Justin Morneau.	The Padres popped back ahead on Yasmani Grandal's sacrifice fly in the fifth that brought in Gyorko, who hit a leadoff double.	San Diego got a run in the bottom of the first with some help from replay. Yangervis Solarte originally was called out on a grounder to shortstop. Manager Bud Black appealed and the call was overturned, giving Solarte an infield single. He scored on Rene Rivera's one-out single.	Matzek allowed five runs and eight hits in six innings, struck out a career-high nine and walked two.	Gyorko raised his average to a season-high .199. He struggled after signing a $35 million contract extension two weeks into his second season. He later spent 44 games on the disabled list with plantar fasciitis.	WHIFFS	Padres pitchers set a franchise record for strikeouts in a three-game series with 37. The previous record was 35 during a series at the Chicago Cubs July 22-24.	NICE TRY	Liriano, the right fielder, almost had the Padres' third diving catch into the stands in two games, but couldn't hold onto a foul ball as he tumbled into the seats. On Tuesday night, 3B Chris Nelson and 1B Tommy Medica made nice catches of foul balls while tumbling into the stands.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rockies: All-Star SS Troy Tulowitzki, leading the majors with a .340 average, will have surgery on his left hip Friday in Vail, Colorado, ending his season.	Padres: SS Solarte strained a muscle in his left side making an errant throw in the seventh and was replaced by Alexi Amarista. 1B Yonder Alonso will go on the DL with a right wrist injury.	UP NEXT	Rockies: LHP Jorge De La Rosa (11-8, 4.34) starts at home Thursday vs. Cincinnati. He's made nine straight starts of at least six innings.	Padres: LHP Eric Stults (5-13, 4.76) has allowed three or fewer runs earned runs in eight of his last nine starts going into his assignment Thursday at St. Louis.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.	Jhoulys Chacín has agreed to a guaranteed $1.25 million, one-year contract with the Rockies.

BALTIMORE -- Limited to three hits over seven innings, the Baltimore Orioles turned to their reliable, standard weapon -- the home run -- to pull out a comeback victory over the New York Yankees.	Jonathan Schoop and Adam Jones connected in a four-run eighth inning, and Baltimore completed a two-game sweep of the rain-shortened series with a 5-3 win Wednesday night.	The Orioles lead the majors with 152 home runs, are 35-10 when hitting more than one and 58-25 when going deep at least once.	After Schoop tied it with a drive off Dellin Betances, Shawn Kelley (2-4) gave up a single and a walk before Jones hit a shot into the bullpen area beyond the center-field wall.	"When we're down by one we always feel we're just one pitch away," Jones said. "So that happened, and once we tie the game all the marbles are up. First one to score one wins."	Jones made it happen. As the ball dropped over the fence for his 23rd home run, he raised his right arm in triumph as he rounded first base.	"Big spot, big home run," Jones said. "Nothing wrong with showing a little emotion here and there."	Darren O'Day (4-1) worked the eighth and Zach Britton gave up a run in the ninth en route to his 25th save.	It was the eighth straight series win for the AL East-leading Orioles, who increased their margin over the fading third-place Yankees to eight games. Baltimore is 8-3 against New York this season, outscoring the Yankees 60-31.	"It's tough right now because they are hitting very good," New York's Francisco Cervelli said. "They've got a couple of hitters who are really hot right now."	Yankees manager Joe Girardi missed the finish after being ejected in the seventh inning by home plate umpire Gerry Davis. Girardi was furious after Davis called New York's Stephen Drew out for running in the baseline on his way to first base.	"Yeah, well, Gerry was wrong," Girardi said.	Girardi's second ejection of the year came with New York ahead 2-1 on the strength of Cervelli's second home run of the year, a two-run drive in the third inning off Chris Tillman.	The lead didn't stand up, and now the Yankees are stuck in a four-game skid and scrambling to stay in the playoff hunt.	"We've got to start winning series again," Girardi said. "We have not won the last two series and we put ourselves in a little bit of a hole."	Making his first appearance in the big leagues since April 23, New York starter Michael Pineda retired the first 12 batters he faced before Nelson Cruz doubled to open the fifth.	Pineda allowed one run and two hits over five innings. After being suspended for 10 games for using a foreign substance on the mound in April, the right-hander went on the disabled list with a shoulder muscle injury. He left after throwing 67 pitches.	"We thought he started getting the ball up a little bit," Girardi said.	Baltimore played without its two starters on the left side of the infield. Third baseman Manny Machado was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a sprained right knee ligament and shortstop J.J. Hardy missed a third straight game with a sprained left thumb.	Tillman gave up two runs and five hits in seven innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: After throwing fastballs off flat ground, RHP Masahiro Tanaka (elbow inflammation) said through an interpreter, "I feel good because everything is progressing in the way that I want it to." Girardi said, "Our hope is he'll pitch in September."	Orioles: Machado said his injury is "not as bad as we thought." Hardy hopes to return for the weekend series in Cleveland.	UP NEXT	Yankees: After taking Thursday off, the Yankees open a three-game series in Tampa Bay. Girardi has opted to start Hiroki Kuroda on Sunday instead of Chris Capuano.	Orioles: Baltimore gets a day off before facing the Indians to launch a nine-game road trip that includes a week's stay in Chicago, where it will face the White Sox and Cubs.	BEAST IN THE EAST	The Orioles are 30-19 against AL East foes, the best in-division record in the AL. New York is 21-25 in the division, which goes a long way toward explaining its deficit in the East.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

DETROIT --  Victor Martinez drove in three runs to help Detroit to a much-needed win, then offered a bit of a plea to Tigers fans who have been losing patience with the AL Central favorites.	"It's not fair when people out there are thinking that we've got to win this division by 10, 15, 20 games," Martinez said. "We're not playing Little League teams. We're trying. It's too long of a season. At some point you're going to struggle. Every team struggles at some point.	"As a fan, if you're going to be with us when we're doing good, we really need the fans when we're struggling too."	Martinez had three hits, and Nick Castellanos homered and tripled to lead the Tigers to an 8-4 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Wednesday night.	Detroit rallied from a 4-1 deficit and snapped a four-game losing streak, but the Tigers remained a half-game behind first-place Kansas City.	The Tigers are suddenly facing adversity amid mounting injuries. They had to send Buck Farmer to the mound to make his major league debut, and he allowed four runs in five innings.	Blaine Hardy (2-1) followed with two scoreless innings of relief, lowering his ERA to 2.05. He's been a rare bright spot in a bullpen that's been unreliable.	"He's done an excellent job, really," manager Brad Ausmus said. "He's not strictly a lefty-lefty guy. He's got the ability to get right-handed hitters out, which gives me a lot of flexibility in the middle innings."	Castellanos put Detroit ahead 5-4 with a solo homer off Vance Worley (5-2) in the sixth. Martinez added a bases-loaded single in the seventh.	The Tigers returned home after going 2-7 on a road trip against the New York Yankees, Toronto and Pittsburgh. A 19-inning loss to the Blue Jays stretched the pitching staff thin, and Anibal Sanchez and Justin Verlander are nursing injuries.	The game was tied at 1 in the fourth when Pittsburgh's Jordy Mercer hit an RBI triple and Travis Snider followed with a two-run homer. The Tigers tied it with three runs in the fifth.	Alex Avila led off with a homer to make it 4-2, and after a single by Eugenio Suarez, Ezequiel Carrera hit a grounder to second. Jayson Nix tried to make a tough throw to second to get the lead runner, but his throw was poor, and the error helped Detroit to a big inning. Miguel Cabrera eventually hit a sacrifice fly, and Martinez tied it with a two-out RBI single.	Castellanos hit his ninth homer of the year with one out in the sixth.	"I think the pitches that hurt were the home runs," Worley said. "Couple of guys who I got behind -- had to throw good pitches."	Worley allowed five runs -- three earned -- and nine hits in 5 1/3 innings.	TOUGH SPOT: Farmer has spent most of this season at Class A West Michigan, and he was called up from Double-A Erie to make this start for the Tigers. He made it through the order the first time without allowing a hit, but the Pirates scored a run in the third and three in the fourth.	He allowed six hits and a walk and struck out four, and the Tigers were able to rally after he left the game.	OUTFIELD PROBLEMS: Pittsburgh center fielder Starling Marte made a diving attempt on Castellanos' hit in the second, and the ball got past him for a triple. Right fielder Gregory Polanco couldn't handle Torii Hunter's double in the fourth, and Polanco's long run to right-center in the seventh was for naught when he was unable to make the catch on Carrera's drive, which went for a triple.	FOR THE BIRDS: Worley and Cabrera both seemed distracted by two birds that settled in between the mound and the plate while Cabrera was batting in the first. Cabrera stepped out and waved his bat at them, then Worley rolled a ball to the plate, trying to shoo them away.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: Pittsburgh was once again without 2B Neil Walker, who has been limited to only three games this month. Walker has been bothered by a bad back.	Tigers: Detroit 2B Ian Kinsler stayed in the game and seemed to be OK after a pitch by Stolmy Pimentel bounced weirdly and hit him in the side of the head.

ATLANTA --  The Atlanta Braves needed six tries to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers this season.	Justin Upton thinks the Braves took too long.	"We've battled them hard and we've let some games get away late," Upton said. "It's nice to get a win. We had to work for this one, so it was nice to see."	Ervin Santana won his sixth straight start at Turner Field, Upton drove in the go-ahead run in the fifth inning and the Atlanta Braves snapped a two-game skid with a 3-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Wednesday night.	Andrelton Simmons returned to the lineup after missing six games with a sprained left ankle and had two RBIs for the Braves, who had lost 11 of 13.	Hyun-Jin Ryu (13-6) left the game with a right gluteus muscle injury after allowing six hits and three runs with two walks and seven strikeouts in 5 2/3 innings.	"I don't think it's something serious right now," Ryu said through a translator. "It's not like my arm blew out. I think I can jump right back on the mound. I just want to be cautious of it as well."	The victory allowed second-place Atlanta to stay five games behind Washington in the NL East.	Los Angeles, which leads San Francisco by five games in the NL West, was trying to earn a sixth straight win over the Braves for the first time since Sept. 20, 1987-April 16, 1988.	Santana (12-6) improved to 5-0 with a 2.70 ERA in his last six starts overall, giving up eight hits, two runs and two walks with nine strikeouts in six innings. The right-hander improved to 8-2 with a 3.48 ERA at Turner Field this year.	Atlanta closer Craig Kimbrel got the last three outs to earn his 35th save in 39 chances. He walked the first batter he faced, pinch-hitter Andre Either, and the next batter, Dee Gordon, reached on a bunt single.	Kimbrel struck out Yasiel Puig for the first out and gave up a single to Adrian Gonzalez to load the bases before Matt Kemp grounded into a double play to end the game.	"The moment doesn't get away from him," Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez said of Kimbrel. "He has the maturity of being in situations closing big games, but he doesn't get rattled a lot."	The Dodgers took a 2-0 lead in the second on RBI singles by Carl Crawford and Miguel Rojas.	The Braves cut the lead to 2-1 in their half of the second when Evan Gattis doubled, moved to third on a bunt and scored on Simmons' RBI groundout.	Chris Johnson, who was hitting .434 against left-handers this season, decided on his own to move over Gattis with a rare sacrifice against Ryu.	"Whatever it takes to win ballgames, whatever it takes to runs, we've got to do that," Johnson said. "We can't sit on our ego or anything like that. If I have to bunt, I have to bunt."	Simmons' bloop RBI single in the fourth tied the score 2-2.	Atlanta went up in the fifth. Jason Heyward, batting leadoff for the first time since June 17, singled, advanced when Freeman was hit by a pitch and scored from second on Upton's RBI single.	Puig went 0 for 4 with four strikeouts and one walk.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: Ryu grabbed the back of his top right leg after as he stood in front of the mound after walking B.J. Upton in the sixth and motioned for a trainer. He walked off the field under his own power. The Dodgers are listing him as day to day.	Braves: Simmons, who went 1 for 4, appeared to run and field with no ill effects after missing the last six games with a sprained left ankle.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: RHP Roberto Hernandez (6-8) will make his second start since arriving in an Aug. 8 trade with Philadelphia, has a 2.87 ERA and a .189 opponents' batting average in his last eight games.	Braves: RHP Aaron Harang (9-6) didn't receive a decision in his last five starts despite a 2.81 ERA.	SMILES IN THE USA: Atlanta bullpen coach Eddie Perez, a native of Venezuela, said before the game that he took a U.S. oath of naturalization in the morning with his family in attendance. Perez, the 1999 NLCS MVP and a Braves coach since 2005, was shown on the video board before the start of the fourth inning and waved to the cheering crowd.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

NEW YORK --  Despite three untimely errors, the Washington Nationals found a way to win at Citi Field. They always do.	Asdrubal Cabrera hit his first home run for Washington and tumbled over a retaining wall to make a terrific catch, leading the Nationals past the New York Mets 3-2 Wednesday night for their 10th straight victory in Queens.	"We're going to have games like this every once in a while. The fact that we were able to overcome it is key," manager Matt Williams said. "We were fortunate tonight."	Rafael Soriano held on in the ninth following Travis d'Arnaud's leadoff homer, getting the final two outs after the Mets put a pair of runners in scoring position.	Matt den Dekker was thrown out at home on pinch-hitter Eric Campbell's grounder to shortstop -- and the call was upheld after a replay review to determine whether catcher Wilson Ramos blocked the plate illegally. Curtis Granderson hit a comebacker on the next pitch, giving Soriano his 27th save in 31 tries.	"We've got the best bullpen in the game," starter Jordan Zimmermann said.	Bryce Harper and Kevin Frandsen each hit a sacrifice fly in the seventh to make a winner of Zimmermann (8-5), who did not permit an earned run or a walk in 6 1/3 innings.	Drew Storen pitched out of a bases-loaded jam in the bottom half, and the NL East leaders won for the 24th time in their last 28 road games against the Mets dating to Sept. 12, 2011. They haven't lost in Queens since June 29 last year.	"Come out of here kind of feeling like you stole one," Adam LaRoche said. "Luckily our pitchers in a few innings made some big pitches when we needed them. Kind of bailed our defense out, which has been pretty solid."	Washington has outscored the Mets 70-20 during the winning streak at Citi Field, which ties a franchise record for the longest at one venue away from home. The Montreal Expos won 10 road games in a row against the Chicago Cubs from 1982-83.	"This is a tough one because they gave us a chance to beat them tonight," New York manager Terry Collins said.	Coming off his 200th career win last Friday, Mets starter Bartolo Colon (11-10) allowed two runs -- one earned -- in seven innings.	Leading 1-0, Colon gave up a leadoff double in the seventh to LaRoche. LaRoche stopped at third on a single to center by Ian Desmond, who advanced to second when Juan Lagares' high throw ticked off the glove of cutoff man Lucas Duda for an error.	That ended up hurting the Mets. Harper tied it with a sacrifice fly, Ramos singled and Frandsen put the Nationals ahead with another sacrifice fly.	"One bad pitch and they took advantage," Colon said through a translator.	Cabrera connected in the eighth off Jeurys Familia. The two-time All-Star hit nine home runs for Cleveland this season before he was dealt to Washington at the July 31 trade deadline.	In the bottom half, Cabrera bolted from his spot at second base and made a running catch of Granderson's foul pop just before hitting a retaining wall and going head over heels.	Frandsen handed New York its first run when he dropped d'Arnaud's fourth-inning fly in front of the left-field warning track.	"It's not being lazy or anything -- just dropped it. That stuff happens," Frandsen said. "Especially after screwing up and making a huge mistake, you've got to redeem yourself."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: RF Jayson Werth sat out again and will remain sidelined for at least a couple of days after receiving a cortisone injection for his sore right shoulder. Williams said Werth has a sprained AC joint, but an MRI showed no structural damage.	Mets: RHP Matt Harvey (elbow) threw 27 pitches during a bullpen session at the team's complex in Port St. Lucie, Florida. ... RHP Daisuke Matsuzaka (right elbow inflammation) is scheduled for another rehab outing Saturday with Double-A Binghamton.	UP NEXT	Looking for a three-game sweep, Washington sends Stephen Strasburg (8-10, 3.68 ERA) to the mound Thursday night against Dillon Gee (4-4, 3.54), who is 7-3 with a 3.23 ERA in 13 career starts against the Nationals.	DIFFERENT STORY	Michael Taylor, who homered in his major league debut Tuesday, went 0 for 4 with three strikeouts for the Nationals. Taylor started in center field and batted leadoff, his regular spot in the lineup at Double-A this season. Center fielder Denard Span was rested before entering on defense in the eighth.	BUSY MAN	Mets star David Wright extended his hitting streak to 12 games with a first-inning single. But the crowd groaned as he tried to stretch it to a double and was thrown out easily by Frandsen, who also made a sliding grab on Wright's drive in the sixth.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Tampa Bay right-hander Chris Archer got his only two walks out of the way against the first three Texas hitters.	Then Archer started piling up the strikeouts. The hard-throwing right-hander got into such a groove that he didn't realize he struck out six Rangers in a row at one point in the Rays' 10-1 victory Wednesday night.	"It's just one of those situations where you get in the zone and you black out," Archer said. "Your hard work and practice takes over."	Archer (8-6) had a career-high 12 strikeouts in seven innings and Matt Joyce hit the first of Tampa Bay's three early home runs. After those two walks, Archer got out of the first when Alex Rios went down swinging to start the strikeout streak.	"When he struck out Rios," I felt a lot better," manager Joe Maddon said. "That was the real deep slider that we're used to seeing. I liked that. `'	It was Archer's third career game with at least 10 strikeouts, and two have come against the Rangers. He struck out 11 against Texas in a home game on Sept. 8, 2012, in his third career start.	After Joyce homered in the first, Sean Rodriguez and Brandon Guyer hit two-run shots in the second off righty Miles Mikolas (1-5).	"I think it was kind of nice to jump out in front with the big hit like that," Joyce said. "The guys seemed to be aggressive with the ball in the zone and up in the zone. Just really driving the ball."	James Loney drove in two runs with his three singles for Tampa Bay, which extended its AL record by allowing three runs or less in 17 consecutive road games. Only the 1908 Chicago Cubs had a longer stretch -- 21 in a row.	Texas got its run when Leonys Martin had a leadoff double in the fifth and came home on Jim Adduci's sacrifice fly.	Left-hander Alex Claudio, whose contract was purchased from Triple-A Round Rock earlier Wednesday when Rangers ace Yu Darvish went on the disabled list, retired all three batters he faced in his major league debut.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: CF Desmond Jennings didn't play because of a sore shoulder, a night after slamming hard into the wall while making an incredible running catch. Jennings could be back in the lineup Thursday.	Rangers: Darvish was placed on the 15-day disabled list because of right elbow inflammation and won't start the series finale Thursday as scheduled. The move was retroactive to Sunday, a day after Darvish lost his last start. INF Jurickson Profar, out all season because of a torn muscle in his shoulder, took some grounders without making any throws.	UP NEXT	Rookie RHP Jake Odorizzi (8-9) pitches for the Rays, who wrap up a 10-game road trip. Tampa is 5-4 on this trip, and 20-6 away from home since June 15. LHP Robbie Ross (2-4) is set to be recalled from Triple-A Round Rock to start in Darvish's spot. Texas has lost 20 of its last 27 home games.	ANOTHER NAME TO THE LIST	Claudio, who didn't arrive at the ballpark until about an hour after the game began, became the club-record 56th different player and 17th rookie used by the Rangers this season. He was also the record 34th pitcher, and that became 35 in the ninth when catcher J.P. Arencibia pitched in the majors for the first time, allowing one hit in a scoreless ninth. He was the third position player to pitch for the Rangers this year.	ALMOST GONE	Between the homers by Rodriguez and Guyer in the second, Curt Casali hit a towering drive that hit on top of the 14-foot wall in left field and ricocheted back onto the field. Umpires looked at replay that confirmed the ball remained in play for a double.	MUCH LESS TIME	A night after a 14-inning game that took 4 hours, 49 minutes to play, the third game of the four-game set was played in 2 hours, 51 minutes.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CHICAGO -- Javier Baez and Anthony Rizzo hit back-to-back home runs as the Chicago Cubs roughed up Kyle Lohse and the Milwaukee Brewers 4-2 on Wednesday night.	Starlin Castro, Rizzo and Baez, the nucleus of Theo Epstein's rebuilding effort, drove in all four runs against the NL-leading Brewers. Castro and Chris Coghlan contributed three hits each.	Cubs starter Tsuyoshi Wada (2-1) was coasting until he was chased in the seventh, when he allowed consecutive home runs to Rickie Weeks and Martin Maldonado. Wada allowed two runs on five hits in 6 2/3 innings. He struck out five and walked one.	Hector Rondon pitched a scoreless ninth for his 16th save in 20 tries.	Lohse (11-7) allowed four runs on seven hits in three innings, and tweaked his right ankle during an at-bat.	It was his shortest outing of the season and marked the second time in his last three starts that he failed to pitch into the fifth inning.	Coghlan hit Lohse's second pitch of the game off the center-field wall for a double and scored on Rizzo's sacrifice fly. Castro drove in Baez on a single to give the Cubs a 2-0 lead in the first inning.	Baez and Rizzo sent the crowd buzzing in the third inning with back-to-back shots. Baez hit a tape-measure shot onto Waveland Ave. leading off the inning and Rizzo hit Lohse's next pitch into the right-field basket for a 4-0 advantage. It was Baez's fourth of the season and Rizzo's 27th.	After not hitting a home run since July 22nd, Rizzo has hit home runs in consecutive games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: After soreness persisted in his right elbow, INF Jeff Bianchi had a second opinion in Arizona that confirmed the original diagnosis. He has sat out 25 games on the disabled list.	Cubs: LHP Felix Doubront (strained calf) allowed three runs on four hits and two walks in four innings on Tuesday night. The recent arrival could join the parent club after one more start for Triple-A Iowa this week. RHP Brian Schlitter (inflamed shoulder) began his rehabilitation stint at the club's spring training complex in Mesa, Ariz.	UP NEXT: Brewers RHP Mike Fiers (1-1, 1.80) will oppose Cubs RHP Edwin Jackson (6-12, 5.61) in the series finale Thursday.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Jered Weaver pitched into jams and out of trouble in every early inning, waiting for the Los Angeles Angels' slumbering bats to provide some help.	The Angels came through with just enough offense to seal a sweep of Philadelphia.	Howie Kendrick delivered a go-ahead, two-run single in the sixth inning, and Weaver pitched six resilient innings in the Angels' 4-3 victory over the Phillies on Wednesday night.	Weaver (13-7) yielded two runs and eight hits for the Angels, improving to 6-1 in his last 10 starts despite trailing 2-1 in the sixth.	"You keep this team in the game, and the offense is going to come through," said Weaver, who improved to 16-4 in interleague play. "If you can limit those guys, we'll always have a chance."	Brennan Boesch drove in two runs for the Angels, who salvaged a 3-4 homestand by sweeping two games from the last-place Phillies. Los Angeles (70-49) pulled within 2 1/2 games of Oakland atop the overall major league standings.	The Angels' once-powerful offense struggled throughout the homestand, but came alive in the sixth inning of both games against the Phillies. One night after Los Angeles scored seven runs in the sixth, it scored three more against A.J. Burnett (6-13), who had shut down the Angels in the first five.	Albert Pujols started the rally with a one-out double, and Kendrick's bases-loaded bloop landed just inside the right-field line. Boesch, recalled from the minors Tuesday, then added an RBI groundout. He also had a sacrifice fly in the second.	"We didn't kill the ball, and the early runs weren't there, but we broke through and held a lead," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "Right now, we've got to scratch and claw if you're not going to score runs. That's the only way you're going to beat good pitchers like Burnett."	Burnett gave up five hits and four walks over six innings, dropping to 0-5 in his last six starts.	"I don't feel snakebit," Burnett said. "It's in my control. I mean, it definitely hasn't gone the way I wanted it to. I'm very discouraged. I'm not going to lie. I'm not a bit happy, but the season is not over."	Marlon Byrd and Jimmy Rollins had early run-scoring singles for the Phillies, who have lost nine straight games to the Angels since 2003.	Grady Sizemore tripled and scored on Domonic Brown's groundout in the eighth against Joe Smith, but Huston Street pitched a perfect ninth for his seventh save. Street has made 10 scoreless appearances since the Angels acquired the All-Star closer from San Diego last month.	TROUT SNARED:	Mike Trout went 0 for 4, capping an ugly 4-for-29 homestand for the Angels' MVP candidate. Trout, who grew up a Phillies fan in southern New Jersey, saw his average drop from .305 to .294 in seven games.	A NEW WEAVER:	The Angels' longtime ace pitched two days after his wife, Kristin, gave birth to their second child, daughter Josie.	Weaver will bring his family home from the hospital on Thursday before catching up with the Angels in Texas on Friday for the series opener.	"My wife let me get my rest," Weaver said.	TRAINER'S ROOM:	Angels: Tyler Skaggs had elbow ligament replacement surgery Wednesday. He won't return until 2016. Reliever Mike Morin, who cut his foot, is scheduled to pitch in the minors Thursday, hoping to return to the Angels on Saturday.	UP NEXT:	Phillies: After a travel day, Cole Hamels (6-6, 2.37 ERA) takes the mound in San Francisco.	Angels: After a day off, Garrett Richards (12-4, 2.54 ERA) opens a weekend series at Texas.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SEATTLE --  With the Seattle Mariners making a push for their first playoff appearance since 2001, Kendrys Morales might be the perfect hitter to help make it happen.	Morales, acquired from Minnesota before the trade deadline, hit a two-run home run in the first inning to back a stellar start by Hisashi Iwakuma and lead the Mariners to a 2-0 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays on Wednesday night.	Morales' homer was his second in three at-bats, a span that started Tuesday night, and helped Seattle complete a sweep of the three-game series. Morales has four extra-base hits in three games, twice what he recorded in his first 15 games with the club since joining the team.	"He brought it as soon as he got here -- respectability, stretch the lineup out," Mariners manager Lloyd McClendon said. "He hasn't got the results he wanted, but I was happy to see him in there right from the start."	Iwakuma (11-6) failed to finish seven innings for the first time in eight starts, but the right-hander still struck out five without issuing a walk in 6 2/3 innings. It is the seventh time in that stretch Iwakuma has allowed two runs or fewer.	"It's a big series," Iwakuma said through an interpreter. "Winning two ... was big and I needed to finish up the series strong."	Three relievers bridged the gap to closer Fernando Rodney, who earned his 35th save in 38 chances. The Mariners won eight of nine on their homestand and remained tied with Detroit for the American League's second wild card.	The Blue Jays lost for the ninth time in 12 games to drop three games behind the final playoff berth.	"We have been streaky, both good and bad, and we are due for a good one," Toronto starter R.A. Dickey said.	Dickey (9-12) was shaky at times, but only allowed two runs and seven hits with four walks in six innings.	The Mariners threatened on numerous occasions to extend the lead, but Dickey was able to strand at least two runners three separate times. The third proved to be the veteran's greatest escape act, perhaps, as he avoided a one-out runners-on-the-corners situation by inducing a double-play grounder.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: OF Michael Saunders will return to Triple-A Tacoma to continue his rehab assignment after leaving the team to attend the birth of his second child, a son. Saunders, on the 15-day disabled list with a strained left oblique, will need more at-bats in the minors before rejoining the Mariners.	Blue Jays: 1B Edwin Encarnacion (strained right quadriceps) went 1 for 4 while playing all nine innings in the field on Wednesday for Triple-A Buffalo, which keeps him on track to rejoin the team on Friday in Chicago.	UP NEXT	Mariners: Seattle looks to continue its strong play in Detroit on Friday as left-hander James Paxton, 5-0 in his career, makes the start.	Blue Jays: After a miserable start to an eight-game road swing, Toronto will get a day off before attempting to capture its first win of the trip against the White Sox.	MORALES HITS TORONTO	Morales is hitting .440 (11 for 25) with two home runs and six RBI against the Blue Jays this year, and is just .198 (39 for 197) against all other teams.	SHUTDOWN PITCHING	The Mariners extended their club record to 12 consecutive games allowing three runs or fewer. Their previous high was nine games, done from June 1-11, 2009.	ROAD BLUES	The Blue Jays have lost six straight road games and have five more on the trip before returning to Toronto.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ATLANTA -- Despite hitting only .229 in the first 12 games in August, Dee Gordon remained confident in his approach as he refused to make changes that might lead to bad habits.	Gordon's self-confidence paid off on Thursday, as he had three hits and scored four runs to lead the Los Angeles Dodgers past the slumping Atlanta Braves 6-4 on Thursday.	Gordon, hitting .291 overall, also stole two bases, increasing his total to 54, the most in the major leagues.	"Dee Gordon beat us," Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "He's probably your most traditional leadoff hitter I've seen in a long time."	Gordon had plenty of help. Yasiel Puig and Adrian Gonzalez, who followed Gordon in the batting order, each also had three hits. Gonzalez drove in three runs.	"When your guys up top get on, it just changes the game," said Dodgers manager Don Mattingly, who said Gordon "was setting the tone, getting on and stealing bases."	Drew Butera hit a two-run homer, his first in almost three months, in the second inning for the NL West-leading Dodgers, who won three of four in the series.	The Braves, who began the day five games behind first-place Washington in the NL East, have lost 12 of 14.	"We've still got 41 games left," said Braves first baseman Freddie Freeman, who had three hits, including a double in the three-run eighth. "We can still make something of this if we keep grinding."	Roberto Hernandez (7-8), making his second start since his trade from the Phillies on Aug. 7, allowed one run on three hits and four walks in six innings.	Butera's second-inning homer off Aaron Harang (9-7) was only his third of the season and his first since May 16.	Kenley Jansen struck out B.J. Upton with runners on second and third to end the game.	The Braves trailed 5-1 before Justin Upton's two-run double off Brian Wilson in the eighth. Andrelton Simmons' single off Jansen drove in Upton, cutting the Dodgers' lead to one run.	Jansen struck out pinch-hitter Evan Gattis to end the eighth but ran into trouble in the ninth. After giving up a one-out walk to Jason Heyward, Jansen struck out Emilio Bonifacio. Freeman doubled, moving Heyward to third. Jansen wrapped up his 34th save on B.J. Upton's swinging strikeout.	Harang had his worst start in two months, allowing five runs on seven hits and three walks in 4 1-3 innings. Harang hadn't allowed as many runs since he was charged with nine runs, eight earned, in a 10-5 loss to Philadelphia on June 18.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: Mattingly said RHP Josh Beckett won't come off the 15-day disabled list when eligible on Tuesday. Beckett, who has a left hip impingement, will have more tests and Mattingly said surgery "is a possibility." ... Mattingly said LHP Hyun-Jin Ryu may have a MRI after leaving Wednesday night's game with a right gluteus muscle strain.	Braves: After doubling and advancing with a slide into third base in the eighth, Justin Upton left the game with a mild left hamstring strain. "It's something that flares up," he said. The Braves say his status is day to day. B.J. Upton came in as a pinch runner.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: After completing a nine-game road trip, the Dodgers open a home series against Milwaukee as RHP Zack Greinke looks for his 13th win against RHP Jimmy Nelson. Greinke, an All-Star this season, is 6-2 with a 2.66 in 10 home starts.	Braves: Atlanta opens a weekend series against the AL West-leading Oakland A's as LHP Alex Wood (8-9) tries to reach .500 against Jason Hammel (1-4).	AVILAN RECALLED	Luis Avilan, recalled from Triple-A Gwinnett, gave up one run on two hits and a walk in the ninth. He said he focused on his curveball and change-up at Gwinnett. He joins James Russell as left-handers in the Braves' bullpen. The team optioned RHP Juan Jaime to Gwinnett following Wednesday night's win.	BACK TO THE WALL	Puig made a leaping catch of Freeman's drive at the 400-foot mark, falling with his back against the centerfield wall in the sixth.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

DETROIT -- Max Scherzer and Brad Ausmus both knew early on Thursday afternoon that something special might be happening.	Their reactions were slightly different.	When Scherzer struck out eight Pittsburgh batters in the first three innings, Ausmus was thinking of two of the worst days of his playing career.	"I've been the victim of two 20-strikeout games, and when he started out that fast, I was starting to wonder if he could put up a huge total," said Ausmus, who faced Roger Clemens in his 1996 20-K game and Kerry Wood two years later. "He was making pitches that looked like the ones Kerry was throwing that day."	Scherzer also knew a big number was possible, but he didn't care about records.	"I was thinking about it, but not for the reason you probably think," he said. "When I'm getting that many strikeouts early, it means I've throwing all four of my pitches, I'm getting hitters into the kill-zone counts and I'm putting them away. When that's happening, I know I'm probably going to have a good day."	As it turned out, Scherzer had to settle for only 14 strikeouts in eight shutout innings, leading the Detroit Tigers to a 5-2 victory.	"He pitched like a Cy Young winner," Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said. "The volume of pitches that he can throw and command is impressive. I think there's 29 teams in this league that could find a spot for him at the top of their rotation."	Scherzer (14-4) took another step toward a second straight American League Cy Young Award, holding Pittsburgh to three hits and two walks. Since June 22, Scherzer is 6-1 in 10 starts with a 1.78 ERA and 85 strikeouts as opposed to only 52 hits.	Scherzer's performance and a homer from J.D. Martinez gave the Tigers a much-needed sweep of the short two-game series and a split of the four games in the home-and-home series that started Monday in Pittsburgh.	Francisco Liriano (3-9) took a tough loss for Pittsburgh, allowing two runs on three hits and four walks in six innings. He struck out nine, but wasn't able to match Scherzer's brilliance.	The game was a classic pitcher's duel early, with Scherzer striking out 11 batters in the first five innings while Liriano hadn't allowed a hit through four. Martinez, though, changed things with a long homer off Liriano to start the fifth.	Detroit posed a much bigger threat to Liriano in the next inning, loading the bases with one out. Torii Hunter struck out, but Liriano walked Martinez with his 99th pitch of the game to make it 2-0.	That was enough for Scherzer, who cruised through eighth innings without much stress.	"We needed a win, and our bullpen needed a break," Scherzer said. "So this was a huge game for us."	The Tigers broke the game open in the eighth, scoring one run on a throwing error by Michael Martinez before Nick Castellanos added a two-run single. That became important when Gaby Sanchez hit a 2-run homer off Phil Coke in the ninth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Detroit: The Tigers had to make another roster move Thursday, thanks to the injuries sustained by Justin Verlander, Anibal Sanchez and Joakim Soria. Buck Farmer, who started Wednesday's game, was sent to Triple-A Toledo, while RHP Melvin Mercedes was recalled from the Mud Hens.	Pittsburgh: Neil Walker has missed 11 of the last 12 games with back tightness, but Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said he isn't heading for the DL. Walker was on the on-deck circle as a pinch hitter when Thursday's game ended. SS Jordy Mercer left the game with tightness in his right forearm, and Hurdle didn't know if he would miss any time.	UP NEXT	Detroit: The Tigers welcome back recently traded Austin Jackson on Friday in the first of a three-game series with the Mariners. Jackson, who left in the deadline deal for David Price, will face Rick Porcello (13-7, 3.11), while James Paxton (2-0, 2.38) starts for Seattle.	Pittsburgh: The Pirates head for the nation's capital for a three-game weekend series against the Nationals. Charlie Morton (5-11, 3.62) starts for Pittsburgh in Friday's opener, while the Nationals will have Tanner Roark (11-7, 2.86) on the mound.	NATHAN APOLOGIZES	Tigers closer Joe Nathan apologized Tuesday for the Italian chin-flick gesture he aimed at the Comerica Park crowd Wednesday night. "I think both sides were frustrated," he said. "I was frustrated. Fans obviously were frustrated. I think for myself, I would apologize for that." Nathan, who has a 5.11 ERA, was booed by the fans during the ninth inning of Detroit's win over the Pirates, and responded after the final out.	COLD BATH	Martinez got an ice bath after the game, but it wasn't because of his home run. He was the latest Tiger to take part in the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, a day after Joba Chamberlain took part. Martinez's dousing was provided by Castellanos, but Martinez immediately turned the tables, calling out Castellanos as the next Tigers player to get soaked for charity. Chamberlain was a little more daring, tagging Ausmus in his list.	SNIDER VERSUS THE TIGERS	Travis Snider was Pittsburgh's biggest weapon in the home-and-home series with Detroit. He hit .467 (7-for-15) in the four games, with six of the seven hits going for extra bases. His leadoff double in the fourth provided one of the few scoring chances against Scherzer.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The Kansas City Royals didn't let Jarrod Dyson's defensive miscue slow them down on Thursday.	Dyson drove in the tying run in a five-run seventh, while Nori Aoki and Billy Butler each drove in two runs and the surging Kansas City Royals rallied to defeat the Oakland Athletics 7-3.	The Royals have won 18 of 22 to move 12 games above .500 for the first time since July 20, 2003.	Dyson lost Josh Reddick's fly ball in the sun in the sixth that gave Oakland two runs.	"I feel pretty good after redeeming myself," Dyson said. "I lost the ball in the sun, so I had to make up for it, pick the team up and pick myself up. It was redeem myself or walk off the field. Which one?"	The Royals took the season series, winning five of seven against the Athletics, who have the best record in the majors.	"We feel pretty good ourselves," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "I think every (starting) pitcher we faced on this homestand has been an All-Star and to take six out of seven is pretty good. I'm happy with where we're at."	Aoki's two-run triple put the Royals ahead 5-3. Butler's single scored Aoki and Alcides Escobar. Dyson fouled off four consecutive pitches before hitting an RBI single to right for the first run of the inning.	Right-hander Jeff Samardzija (3-2) took the loss, giving up four runs, three earned, and eight hits in 6 2/3 innings.	"It happened quick," Melvin said of Samardzjia's giving up two hits in the seventh.	"Pitch-count wise, he was great. He had good life on his splitter and his fastball was great."	He left with a 3-2 lead, but Ryan Cook failed to hold it, facing three batters and all scored. Cook's streak of 21 consecutive scoreless innings ended.	"They're capitalizing on mistakes right now," Cook said. "That's what a good ballclub does. I think we do that. They're a good ballclub that's also hot."	Aaron Crow (6-1), the third of six Kansas City pitchers, picked up the victory, retiring the only batter he faced.	Starter James Shields gave up three runs and seven hits in six innings and has a 1.94 ERA in his past eight starts. Greg Holland earned the final two outs for his 36th save in 38 opportunities.	The A's scored two runs in the sixth when Dyson lost Josh Reddick's high fly in the sun for a triple, which scored Stephen Vogt.	"I felt real bad cause we had the lead and they came back and snatched the lead from us," Dyson said.	Alberto Callaspo drove in two Oakland runs with a single and a sacrifice fly.	ON DECK	Athletics: RHP Jason Hammel will start the opener of a weekend series at Atlanta. The A's last played at Atlanta in 2008, losing two of three.	Royals: LHP Danny Duffy will start Friday at Minnesota, where the Royals have lost four of six this season. The Royals play their next nine on the road, all against clubs in last place in their division -- Minnesota, Colorado and Texas.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: SS Jed Lowrie was placed on the disabled list after the game with a broken right index finger. Lowrie, who injured it Aug. 4, returned to San Francisco to have his finger checked further.	Royals: 1B Eric Hosmer's MRI of his broken finger showed progress, but he still will not be allowed to swing a bat for at least another week.	ROOKIE SENSATION	Royals IF Christian Colon had his second three-hit game, including a double, stole his first base in the majors and scored a run. He is hitting .444 in five career starts.	PARRINO RECALLED	The A's recalled IF Andy Parrino from Triple-A Sacramento, where he was hitting .286 with 28 extra-base hits and 52 RBIs in 90 games.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO --  Mike Fiers has stepped back into the Milwaukee Brewers' rotation in a big way -- and when they needed a boost.	Fiers struck out a career-high 14 in six innings of three-hit ball, Khris Davis and Mark Reynolds homered, and the Milwaukee Brewers beat the Chicago Cubs 6-2 on Thursday.	Fiers (2-1) dominated and walked only one in his second start this season since being recalled from Triple-A Nashville to face the Dodgers last Saturday. In that one, he pitched eight strong innings and outdueled Zack Greinke for his first win this season.	"I was striking out a bunch of guys," Fiers said. "I definitely knew it was getting up there."	Scooter Gennett drove in two runs with a double, and Elian Herrera and Carlos Gomez each had RBIs for the Brewers.	Fiers made four relief appearances with the Brewers during two weeks in June. But with Matt Garza on the DL and Kyle Lohse nursing a tweaked ankle, Fiers' splashy return as a starter is giving the Brewers a timely lift.	"Yeah I got sent to Triple-A, but it didn't kill me confidence to send me down," Fiers said. "I just had to wait for my opportunity and do it now."	Manager Ron Roenicke thinks Fiers looks as sharp as he was in 2012, when the right-hander was 8-6 with a 2.85 ERA through August.	"It's impressive," Roenicke said. "He looks like the same guy -- just confident, great fastball, able to throw the off-speed when he wants to, not walking people."	Cubs starter Edwin Jackson (6-13) lasted 4 2/3 innings and allowed five runs before being lifted for Jacob Turner, who pitched 2 1/3 scoreless innings in his Cubs debut. Jackson has lost six of his last seven decisions.	"I never felt like I got in a rhythm," Jackson said. "I felt like I was here and there. I never found that happy medium, either I was too low or too high."	REST UP	The Brewers broke through after scoring just five runs in the previous three games in the series -- and six in their last four contests -- despite resting Ryan Braun, Aramis Ramirez and Jean Segura.	Braun was held out the lineup with a sore right hand. Roenicke said Braun has been experiencing a flare-up of a nagging injury.	Roenicke said he noticed a difference in Braun's swing on Wednesday.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: Lohse (11-7) could miss his next start with a right ankle "tweak" he picked up in an at-bat in Wednesday's 4-2 loss to the Cubs, but Roenicke won't make a decision for a few days. The Brewers have an off-day next Tuesday, making the adjustment to their rotation possible. "I'd hate to put him back out there again if that thing is still going to bother him," Roenicke said.	Cubs: OF Justin Ruggiano batted seventh and played right field. Ruggiano sat out Wednesday's game after leaving Tuesday night because of a groin strain.	UP NEXT	Brewers: RHP Jimmy Nelson (2-3, 4.00) faces Dodgers RHP Zack Greinke (12-8, 2.84) at Los Angeles on Friday.	Cubs: LHP Travis Wood (7-9, 4.86) starts against New York Mets RHP Zack Wheeler (7-8, 3.53). Wood hasn't won since beating Philadelphia on June 15 and is on a four-game losing streak.	GETTING THE CALL	Cubs RHP Dan Straily will start Saturday against the Mets. Straily, acquired July 4 as part of the trade that sent Jeff Samardzija to the Oakland Athletics, is currently at Triple-A Iowa and will be used to help give Cubs starters an extra day of rest during a stretch of 20 games in 20 days.	HOMETOWN FAVORITES	The Cubs play on Chicago's North Side, but are backing the South Side Jackie Robinson West team that began play in the Little League World Series on Thursday. Cubs player were given T-shirts that read "CUBS (heart symbol) JRW" on the front and "ONE CITY" on the back to recognize Jackie Robinson West, which is comprised of all African-American players and the first team from its league to make an appearance in the event in 31 years.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BOSTON -- In just a few minutes, Boston's hitters turned a slow offensive night into an easy victory.	Dustin Pedroia's two-run double capped a seven-run sixth inning Thursday night that sent the Red Sox to their fourth straight win, 9-4 over the Houston Astros.	"We came to life. We were able to combine some base on balls with some base hits," manager John Farrell said. "It seemed like we got a couple of pitches up in the zone from (Scott) Feldman. The first time or two in the order he kept us in check and kept us off balance."	Pedroia finished with three hits, Daniel Nava had two doubles and David Ortiz added two singles as the Red Sox improved to 8-0 at Fenway Park against the Astros.	Matt Dominguez hit a two-run homer for Houston, which opened a 10-game road trip with its fourth loss in five games.	Allen Webster (3-1) gave up four runs -- three earned -- and five hits in six innings for Boston.	"I grinded through it and then they took over with the seven runs," the soft-spoken Webster said. "I can't complain at all."	Trailing 4-1, the Red Sox chased Feldman (6-9) during their biggest inning of the season.	"It just snowballed. He was one pitch away from getting out of it, but they just continued to find holes and continued to keep the line moving," Houston manager Bo Porter said. "Before that he was in complete command of the game and really was commanding both sides of the plate."	Pedroia's ground-rule double bounced off the chalk on the right-field line and caromed into the stands. Ortiz, Mike Napoli and Will Middlebrooks each had an RBI single before Jackie Bradley Jr. drew a bases-loaded walk from reliever Darin Downs that pushed Boston ahead 5-4.	Christian Vazquez had a sacrifice fly before Pedroia's double. Brock Holt opened the inning with a hustle double and drew a walk as the Red Sox sent 12 batters to the plate.	Feldman was charged with seven runs on nine hits in 5 1/3 innings. And he felt he was in trouble before the big inning.	"I think it actually started probably before that," he said. "It felt like I had turned into a one-pitch guy. I really had command of only one pitch, from like the fourth, fifth, sixth, something like that."	The Astros scored single runs in the second and third before Dominguez's homer made it 4-0 in the fourth. Dominguez homered into the Green Monster seats after Jon Singleton's leadoff walk.	Boston sliced it to 4-1 when Pedroia scored on Yoenis Cespedes' double-play grounder.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: OF Alex Presley (strained right oblique) won't play in games and will only get treatment for a couple of days because he had some discomfort during his minor league rehabilitation assignment at Class A Tri-City.	Red Sox: Cespedes was back in the lineup after coming out of Wednesday's game with a bruised right hand, but fouled a ball off his shin and left in the ninth. ... Farrell said outfielder Allen Craig, on the 15-day disabled list with a sprained left foot, will take batting practice the next few days before being sent on a rehab assignment.	UP NEXT	LHP Dallas Keuchel (10-8, 3.07 ERA) pitches Friday for the Astros after losing his last start, giving up five runs in six innings at home against Texas. It was his worst start in more than a month.	Red Sox RHP Clay Buchholz (5-7, 5.98) looks for his second strong start against Houston this season. He struck out 12 in a complete-game victory at Minute Maid Park on July 13.	WHAT A THROW	Nava nailed Jake Marisnick at the plate with a throw on the fly from medium-deep right field when he was trying to score on Jose Altuve's fly ball to end the seventh.	NO UPDATE	Porter joked that he'll be shutting down injury updates on rookie outfielder George Springer (right quadriceps), who had a setback in his rehab and was shut down for two weeks. Springer has been out since July 19. "In 13 days we can talk about him again," Porter said, smiling.	NO NEED TO PACK FOR A WHILE	The Red Sox opened an 11-game homestand, their longest in more than three years. After four games against Houston, they have four with the Los Angeles Angels and three with Seattle.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK -- Smoke billowed out of the Washington Nationals' clubhouse when the doors opened after yet another victory celebration in New York. The National League East leader's fog machine has been getting plenty of use lately.	No special effects were needed on the field, though.	Stephen Strasburg bounced back from one of his worst starts to pitch seven efficient innings, Bryce Harper and Adam LaRoche each hit a two-run homer, and the Nationals beat the New York Mets 4-1 on Thursday night to set a franchise record with their 11th consecutive win on the road against one team.	"We played really well here," manager Matt Williams said. "Now we've got to go do it at home."	The Mets' 11 straight losses to Washington in Queens are their most against one club at home. New York dropped 10 in a row to the Braves at Shea Stadium from 1991 to 1992.	Strasburg (9-10) gave up three hits and an unearned run, improving to 2-8 in 13 road starts this season. He struck out eight and walked two.	Rafael Soriano was perfect in the ninth for his second straight save in the series and 28th overall. Washington finished a three-game sweep and increased its NL East lead to six games over Atlanta.	LaRoche and Harper both connected after walks by Dillon Gee (4-5). LaRoche homered in the first, and Harper hit a long drive to right-center in the fourth.	"It felt great," said Harper, who missed time with a thumb injury. "That's one of the best balls I've hit all year."	The Nationals hit seven homers in the series, outscoring the Mets 14-4 and continuing a lopsided trend during a streak in New York that began June 30 last year. Washington has outscored the Mets 74-21 during the run at Citi Field, which now tops the Montreal Expos' 10 road wins in a row against the Chicago Cubs from 1982 to 1983.	The Nationals are 25-4 at the Mets' home since Sept. 12, 2011. The teams play four more times this year in New York and three more in Washington, where the Nationals have won four of six meetings. They lead the season series 10-2.	"They've been a thorn in our side for the last two or three years for sure," Mets manager Terry Collins said.	Strasburg was coming off an outing in which he allowed a career-high four homers and seven runs to Atlanta, but he was rarely in trouble Thursday, working his fastball to both sides of the plate.	"I think I wanted to go out there and focus on the execution aspect and just pitch," Strasburg said, "make it a little harder for them to be comfortable."	After a throwing error by shortstop Ian Desmond in the fourth, Lucas Duda hit a sacrifice fly that was caught just in front of the right-center wall.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: Right fielder Jayson Werth missed his third straight game but said he felt 50 percent better after getting a cortisone injection for his ailing right shoulder. Williams thinks Werth might be available to pinch hit Friday against Pittsburgh and could even start Saturday.	Mets: Right-hander Matt Harvey (Tommy John surgery) heard from his manager a day after the ace boasted on a radio program that he was throwing in the mid-90 mph range during a rehabilitation session. The team is being especially cautious with Harvey since starter Jeremy Hefner had a recent setback in his recovery from similar elbow reconstruction. But Harvey still says he wants to pitch this season. "The process is, right now you've got to understand it's the big picture, and the big picture is 2015. So back off," Collins said he told Harvey.	UP NEXT	Nationals: Right-hander Tanner Roark (11-7) faces the Pittsburgh Pirates for the first time. In his first year in the rotation, the 23-year-old has allowed one run or fewer in 13 of his 20 starts since April 21.	Mets: Right-hander Zack Wheeler (7-8) faces the Cubs on Friday night. Wheeler pitched 6 2/3 innings of two-hit ball in his only start against Chicago on June 3, a game the Mets lost 2-1.	GOING STREAKING	David Wright singled in the first to extend his hitting streak to 13 games. Only one of the hits during the run was for extra bases, a double off Washington's Craig Stammen last week.	HOMER-HAPPY HARPER	Harper also homered in the series opener, giving him two long balls in a series for the first time since April 25-28, 2013, against the Reds, STATS said.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

MIAMI --  Marcell Ozuna was in a slump when the game started. It was forgotten when the night was over.	Ozuna doubled home Garrett Jones with the winning run in the 10th inning, and the Miami Marlins topped the Arizona Diamondbacks 5-4 on Thursday night.	"This guy is a huge part of our team," Marlins manager Mike Redmond said of Ozuna, who snapped an 0-for-16 skid earlier in the game. "And he's had some big at-bats and he's gotten some big hits for us throughout the year."	Ozuna's line-drive to left-center came off Bradin Hagens (0-1), who was making his major league debut. Hagens got a double play to escape the ninth, but Jones reached on a leadoff walk in the 10th and scored two batters later.	"I still have to be ready," Hagens said. "It was nice to get in and have a chance to help the team get a win, just unfortunate that it didn't happen."	Mike Dunn (10-5) pitched two perfect innings for Miami and became the first reliever to reach double-digits in wins since Matt Belisle for Colorado in 2011, according to STATS.	"The team played great tonight, coming back," Dunn said.	Mark Trumbo had a pair of RBI singles for Arizona. Diamondbacks starter Chase Anderson allowed nine hits and three runs in six innings, and David Peralta had an RBI triple to highlight a two-run third.	Giancarlo Stanton had three hits for Miami, giving him four multi-hit games in his last 10 outings. Brad Penny, pitching at home for the Marlins for the first time in more than 10 years, allowed five hits and four runs in five-plus innings.	Miami trailed 3-0 early, then chipped away.	Penny and Donovan Solano had doubles in the home half of the third, and Stanton's RBI single got Miami within 3-2. Arizona went up 4-2 in the sixth when Trumbo drew a leadoff walk and eventually scored, but then Hechavarria -- who had exactly one multi-RBI game in his last 108 appearances before Thursday -- brought the Marlins back.	He had a RBI triple in the sixth to get the Marlins within one, then tied it at 4-4 with two out in the eighth with a single that brought home pinch-runner Jordany Valdespin easily from second.	"He's improved so much," Redmond said.	Penny's most recent home start for the Marlins was July 28, 2004 -- which wasn't even in Miami, but rather about 15 miles north in Miami Gardens, Florida at Sun Life Stadium, the facility where the team played before its Little Havana ballpark was built.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: 2B Aaron Hill was out of the lineup for the second straight game, with manager Kirk Gibson saying he was "pretty beat up" but not citing any specific injury. LHP Eury De La Rosa and RHP Randall Delgado were not available Thursday in order to get some rest.	Marlins: LHP Dan Jennings (concussion) is planning on throwing bullpen sessions the next couple of days and is expected to pitch for Single-A Jupiter when the Marlins begin their road trip on Aug. 22. "I'm very pleased with how far he's come in the last few days," Redmond said. Also, INF Derek Dietrich (right wrist) is expected to begin a rehab assignment with Single-A Jupiter on Saturday.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: RHP Trevor Cahill (2-8, 4.86) has won one of his nine starts this season -- but that win was in his last outing, a 14-4 victory over Colorado on Aug. 9. Cahill is 1-1 in four appearances against the Marlins.	Marlins: LHP Brad Hand (2-4, 4.65) makes his 11th start of the season. He's 0-1 with a 2.38 ERA in two career starts against the Diamondbacks	DIAMONDBACK TRIPLES	Arizona came into the night tied with the Los Angeles Dodgers for the major-league lead with 33 triples, and hit two more on Thursday.	PENNY WISE	Penny gave up two leadoff walks, one of the four-pitch variety to Ender Inciarte to open the game, the other to Trumbo in the sixth. Both runners eventually scored. But he also hit his first double since Sept. 19, 2007 to help get the Marlins' offense going.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Jake Odorizzi wasn't shaken by the only run-scoring hit he gave up to the Texas Rangers.	The young right-hander had quite the answer and helped keep an impressive road pitching streak going for the Tampa Bay Rays.	Odorizzi retired the final 10 hitters after allowing a home run, Evan Longoria homered and drove in three runs and the Rays beat the Texas Rangers 6-3 Thursday night.	"The guy's confident," manager Joe Maddon said of his 24-year-old pitcher. "He's swaggering out to the mound, and swaggering back in. The whole group is confident. They're not braggish about it, just businesslike in a confident way."	And they have the numbers to back it up, with Odorizzi striking out seven in seven innings to help give the Rays their AL-record 18th consecutive road game without allowing more than three runs.	Odorizzi (9-9) was the starter the last time Tampa Bay gave up more than three runs -- the last home game before the 10-game trip that just ended with the Rays taking three of four from the Rangers. He gave up five runs in a 7-5 loss to the Los Angeles Angels on Aug. 3.	Following up six shutout innings in a win at the Chicago Cubs, Odorizzi didn't allow another baserunner after Geovany Soto's first homer of the season to pull the Rangers within 4-2.	"I've been growing a lot since the first part of the season," Odorizzi said. "I found out a lot about myself."	Jake McGee pitched a perfect ninth for his 13th save in 14 chances, getting the Rays within three games of the major league record for consecutive road games with three runs or fewer allowed held by the 1908 Cubs.	Robbie Ross (2-5) came up from Triple-A Round Rock to fill in for Texas ace Yu Darvish, who is sidelined with elbow inflammation. The left-hander gave up six runs in 4 1/3 innings.	Ross started the season in the Texas rotation after spending two years as a reliever. He struck out the side in the first but then looked a lot like the pitcher who was sent back to the bullpen in May not long after giving up 30 runs -- 23 earned -- in 26 2/3 innings over five starts.	"I just started maybe being a little too fine and trying to pick around the zone instead of just going right at them like I was in the beginning," Ross said.	THE TWO-RUN BLOWS	Longoria's team-leading 15th homer was a two-run shot that gave the Rays a 6-2 lead in the fifth. Logan Forsythe matched a career high with three hits and put the Rays in front to stay with his two-run homer in the second. It came on an 0-2 pitch after Yunel Escobar reached with two outs on an infield hit when third baseman Adrian Beltre barehanded the slow roller but threw wide to first.	EFFICIENT RAYS	Tampa Bay followed Forsythe's go-ahead homer with an efficient third inning that gave the Rays a 4-0 lead. Brandon Guyer stole second with two outs after an earlier single and came home when Longoria hit a soft liner over Elvis Andrus' head into left-center field. After moving up on a wild pitch, Longoria scored on a single by James Loney.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: CF Desmond Jennings (shoulder) wasn't in the lineup for the second game after running into the wall Tuesday. ... RF Wil Myers (fractured right wrist) could return from a rehab assignment at Triple-A Durham during next week's series against Detroit.	Rangers: An MRI showed that Darvish's elbow inflammation is not a long-term concern, but there's no timetable for his return. He will miss at least two starts and will resume throwing when the tightness eases.	UP NEXT	Rays: Tampa Bay goes home to face the New York Yankees in the first of 32 consecutive games against teams currently in playoff contention. RHP Alex Cobb (7-6, 3.41) goes for his sixth straight win, opposing Yankees RHP Brandon McCarthy (4-1, 2.21 with New York).	Rangers: RHP Nick Martinez (2-8, 5.22) opens a weekend series against the Los Angeles Angels after snapping a 10-start winless streak by beating Houston his last time out. It was the longest such streak for a Texas starter since R.A. Dickey went 11 starts without a win in 2004-05	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ST. LOUIS -- Pinch hitter Jon Jay wasn't choosy when he came up to bat for the Cardinals in the eighth inning.	Jay delivered a two-run double on the first pitch and right fielder Shane Robinson threw out the potential tying run at the plate in the ninth to help St. Louis hold off the San Diego Padres 4-3 on Thursday night.	"I was trying to be aggressive," Jay said. "I wanted something over the plate I could handle. I was able to do that."	Jhonny Peralta hit an early two-run homer for the Cardinals, who moved ahead of Pittsburgh into second place in the National League Central. St. Louis remained two games behind division-leading Milwaukee.	San Diego had its five-game winning streak snapped and fell to 16-9 since the All-Star break.	Trailing by two in the ninth, the Padres loaded the bases with one out against closer Trevor Rosenthal. Pinch hitter Jake Goebbert came through with an RBI single to right, but Alexi Amarista was cut down at home when he tried to score from second.	The replay review lasted 4 minutes, 9 seconds. Padres manager Bud Black then was ejected by plate umpire Bob Davidson for continuing to argue the call.	"You saw two major league players react to a play that indicated that a tag was missed," Black said. "You saw their catcher go back and try to tag our runner because he knew he missed him. You saw our player react knowing that he wasn't tagged. So you saw two experienced major league players react to a play that they both knew wasn't a tag.	"That's what's frustrating to us."	Cardinals catcher A.J. Pierzynski, who entered in the ninth, disagreed.	"I thought I got his arm," Pierzynski said. "I couldn't hear Bob. It was a big play in the game for sure. I couldn't see the umpire who was behind me. You just go. You hope they stay with the call. I think they got it right."	After a four-pitch walk to Will Venable loaded the bases again, Rosenthal struck out Tommy Medica for his 36th save in 40 opportunities.	San Diego reliever Alex Torres (1-1) thought he struck out Tony Cruz leading off the eighth, but it was ruled Cruz foul-tipped the ball. Replays appeared to show Cruz missed the pitch.	Given another chance, Cruz singled on the next delivery.	"I definitely fouled it," Cruz said. "I knew I foul-tipped it. I saw him (Davidson) looking at the first-base umpire (John Tumpane), and he called it that way, too."	Pinch hitter Daniel Descalso walked on four pitches and Matt Carpenter loaded the bases with a single.	Nick Vincent entered to face Jay, who went after the first pitch and drove a one-hop double off the wall in center to snap a 2-all tie. Jay is 5-for-17 with three RBIs as a pinch hitter. He has a six-game hitting streak with seven RBIs.	"It was a good feeling. You just want to contribute if you're not playing," Jay said. "You want to stay ready so if your number gets called you can go out there and contribute."	The move by manager Mike Matheny paid off.	"A huge hit for us. He's been swinging the bat well," Matheny said. "He's had a nice season for us."	Seth Maness (4-2) earned the win with one spotless inning of relief.	Peralta hit his 16th home run to drive in Matt Adams, who led off the second with a single. That lifted Peralta into a tie with Edgar Renteria (2000) and Daryl Spencer (1960) for the St. Louis single-season record for home runs by a shortstop.	The Padres tied the score with two runs in the sixth after loading the bases with none out. Venable scored on a fielder's choice. Medica, who had doubled, came home when Rymer Liriano beat out an infield single with two outs.	Both starters went seven innings.	Cardinals right-hander John Lackey improved on his previous start in Baltimore that resulted in nine earned runs over five innings. Lackey allowed five hits and two runs with five strikeouts.	Eric Stults gave up two runs and four hits for San Diego. Stults has allowed three or fewer earned runs in nine of his past 10 starts.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: First baseman Yonder Alonso was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a strained forearm, retroactive to Wednesday. San Diego recalled INF Jace Peterson from Triple-A El Paso.	Cardinals: Adam Wainwright had a familiar catcher for his bullpen session in Yadier Molina. On July 11, Molina had surgery to repair a torn ligament in his right thumb. Molina wore a brace on the thumb. He had yet to throw a ball or hold a bat without wearing the brace. ... Relief pitcher Jason Motte (strained lower back) is eligible to come off the disabled list Sunday, but he won't be ready.	UP NEXT	San Diego RHP Tyson Ross (11-10, 2.63 ERA) faces St. Louis RHP Lance Lynn (12-8, 2.97) in the second game of the four-game series Friday.	STUMBLING ROOKIE	Cardinals rookie Oscar Taveras was not in the lineup. Taveras went 2-for-20 on the recent six-game road trip, and his batting average dropped to .206.	Robinson started in right. He made a running catch and used his bare hand to brace himself at the wall on a first-inning drive by Medica.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DENVER --  For one night, Charlie Culberson looked a little bit like the shortstop he's trying to replace.	He had the power of Troy Tulowitzki and the nifty moves, too -- jumping out of the way of a shattered bat fragment to cleanly field a grounder.	"Not Tulowitzki," cautioned Culberson, "but if they put (me) in the lineup, I'll be ready to play."	Culberson hit his first homer in more than a month -- a three-run shot in the fifth -- and Jorge De La Rosa pitched seven effective innings to lift the Colorado Rockies over the Cincinnati Reds 7-3 on Thursday.	With Tulowitzki set for season-ending hip surgery Friday, Culberson and Josh Rutledge figure to receive plenty of playing time at shortstop. Culberson definitely made the most of his opportunity Thursday.	"Tulo is our guy," Culberson said. "And shortstop is a big spot to fill. ... I feel like both us can go out there and fill in."	De La Rosa (12-8) allowed three runs and five hits as he improved to 8-2 at Coors Field this season.	Not bad considering he tweaked his Achilles running to first in the second inning. But he came back out to pitch and didn't miss a beat.	"It was bothering me a little bit," De La Rosa said. "But I was able to keep pitching in pain. We'll take care of that before my next start."	Reds All-Star Alfredo Simon (12-8) is winless in six starts since the break. He allowed seven runs -- five earned -- and a season-high 10 hits in five innings.	"He made some mistakes and they hit it hard," Reds manager Bryan Price said. "It's just a matter of executing better pitches and having a better mix of pitches."	Culberson broke the game open by lacing a 95 mph fastball from Simon into the left-field bleachers. It was his first homer since June 29.	The shortstop also flashed his fielding prowess by sidestepping a piece of Todd Frazier's broken bat to field the ball and throw out Frazier by a few steps.	"The bat went further than the ball," Culberson said. "Those things happen. Just got to roll with it."	Charlie Blackmon broke a 2-all tie in the fourth when he drove in a run on a groundout. Drew Stubbs followed with an RBI single against his former team. Both runs were unearned after Simon threw the ball away trying to turn a double play.	"It's good to see some things we did offensively, that we've been struggling to do," Rockies manager Walt Weiss said.	CARGO DONE FOR SEASON	Shortly after the game, the Rockies announced that outfielder Carlos Gonzalez will have season-ending surgery on his left knee Monday. It's been an injury-riddled year for Gonzalez, who is on the disabled list with not only an aching left knee but a sprained right ankle.	He was out earlier this season after doctors found and removed a small tumor in his left index finger.	BACK ON TRACK	Ryan Ludwick was hitless in his last 13 at-bats before breaking out with an RBI double in the second. He added a solo homer in the sixth off De La Rosa that landed near the top of the stands in left.	"Today, I just happened to think along with him," Ludwick said. "Lucky guess."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: RHP Homer Bailey is headed to the disabled list with a strained elbow. Price said he will announce a starter to take Bailey's spot in the rotation Friday. There's no timetable for Bailey's return.	Rockies: OF Michael Cuddyer (broken left shoulder) could be back in the lineup Saturday. The reigning NL batting champ has been on the DL since early June.	UP NEXT	Reds: RHP Johnny Cueto (14-6, 2.05 ERA) can take over the NL lead in wins by beating the Rockies on Friday. Cueto is 6-0 in seven starts since losing at San Diego on July 2.	Rockies: LHP Franklin Morales (5-6, 4.97) will make his first career start against the Reds. He's faced them five times as a reliever, going 2-0 with two saves.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CLEVELAND -- Before touching home plate, Mike Aviles slowed down long enough to get splashed in the face with cold water by his teammates.	Maybe the Indians are waking up just in time.	Aviles homered leading off the 11th inning Friday night to give Cleveland a 2-1 win over the Baltimore Orioles.	Aviles, who made two bare-handed plays at third base earlier in the game, connected on a 1-2 pitch from Brian Matusz (2-3), driving it onto the home run porch in left field for just Cleveland's second run in the past 22-plus innings. The Indians were shut out 1-0 by Arizona in 12 innings on Wednesday night.	After rounding third, Aviles was doused by his jubilant teammates, who then embraced him and danced as one up the first-base line.	"That would have been a tough one to lose," Indians manager Terry Francona said.	The Indians' ninth walk-off win -- and second in three games -- allowed them to keep their playoff push going and not waste another strong outing from Corey Kluber, who allowed just one run in 7⅔ innings and remained unbeaten in eight starts since June.	Scott Atchison (6-0) retired all six batters.	Kluber struck out 10 and has allowed just four runs in 47⅔ innings over six second-half starts. He has a 0.76 ERA since July 6. The stoic Kluber, nicknamed "Klubot" for his passive demeanor, walked one.	"He's so good and he competes," Francona said. "He's just worked himself into being one of the premier pitchers in baseball. He wants to be the best."	Rookie Zach Walters homered off Baltimore starter Wei-Yin Chen as the Indians won for the fourth time in five games.	Blanked until the eighth by Kluber, the Orioles tied it on J.J. Hardy's two-out single. After Kluber got two outs, Nelson Cruz singled off the right-hander, who has been on a remarkable run during the season's second half.	Kluber received a standing ovation from Cleveland's fans as he walked to the dugout, and he had barely taken a seat when the Orioles evened it against Bryan Shaw.	Delmon Young singled and Hardy, who missed the previous four games with a sprained left thumb, also singled, with Cruz scoring ahead of center fielder Michael Brantley's throw to the plate.	Kluber's eight double-digit strikeout games this season are the most for an Indians pitcher since Hall of Famer Dennis Eckersley in 1976.	Walters gave the Indians a 1-0 lead with a homer in the fifth off Chen, who allowed only four hits in seven innings.	During his brilliant second-half stretch, Kluber has struck out 55 in less than 48 innings, outdueled Seattle ace Felix Hernandez, downed the Tigers and Yankees and carried a perfect game into the seventh at Kansas City on July 24 before getting a no-decision.	Kluber hasn't lost since June 30, and that was a 1-0 setback against the Dodgers.	GAMESMANSHIP	Francona wasn't pleased with how the umpires handled Baltimore manager Buck Showalter contesting that Orioles center fielder Adam Jones was hit by a pitch in the eighth. Francona felt the delay -- Jones squared to bunt and appeared to get hit in the hand -- may have affected Kluber. After looking at a replay, the umpires determined Jones offered at the pitch.	THIS BUD'S FOR YOU: Francona had high praise for baseball commissioner Bud Selig, who will be replaced in January by Rob Manfred. Francona has gotten to know Selig over the years and credited him with steering the game through "some tumultuous times."	"I can't imagine trying to please 30 owners and 30 teams," Francona said, "especially the way baseball is set up."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: 3B Manny Machado (sprained right knee) is traveling with the team, but there's no timetable for when his return.	Indians: 1B Nick Swisher will have his right knee examined again on Tuesday in Los Angeles. It's possible he'll need season-ending surgery, and Swisher's injury could explain his lack of production in his second season with Cleveland.	UP NEXT	Former Indians RHP Ubaldo Jimenez (4-8) faces his ex-teammates for the second time this season. Jimenez went 13-9 for Cleveland last season before signing with Baltimore as a free agent. He'll face RHP Carlos Carrasco (4-4), making his second start since returning to Cleveland's rotation.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

WASHINGTON -- Washington Nationals first baseman Adam LaRoche was speaking after Friday night's game when his phone rang, the music from "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" interrupting the interview session.	Timely, too. Because lately at the plate, LaRoche has gone from very bad to very good.	LaRoche and Bryce Harper each had two hits and drove in two runs, leading the Nationals over the Pittsburgh Pirates 5-4 for their fourth straight win.	After hitting .159 in July, the good LaRoche is 17-for-51 (.333) this month, with four homers and nine RBIs.	"I hit those two balls tonight, hit them good, but found the right spot," he said. "I feel two to three works ago those were right at somebody, potential double-play balls."	The left-handed hitting LaRoche said he's been working on hitting the ball to the shortstop side.	"That's in BP, that's in the cage. When the game starts, wherever it goes, it goes," he said. "I was getting in a little bit of a bad habit, pulling off some pitches, especially some pitches away."	Friday night, LaRoche's hits went up the middle and into left field.	"He's staying on the ball better," manager Matt Williams said.	Denard Span added three hits as the NL-East leading Nationals opened a 10-game homestand.	Tanner Roark (12-7) gave up three runs on five hits over 5⅔ innings.	Rafael Soriano allowed three hits in the ninth, including Pedro Alvarez's RBI single, but held on for his 29th save.	Starling Marte hit a two-run homer and singled for the Pirates, losers of three straight.	Charlie Morton (5-12) lasted just three innings in his shortest start of the season, allowing five runs on seven hits and three walks.	"You know, we didn't see a lot of consistency of sink and sharpness to [his] breaking ball," manager Clint Hurdle said.	LaRoche's single made it 1-0 with one out in the first.	With the bases loaded, Harper fouled a 2-2 pitch off his right foot and needed several moments to recover. He stepped in and eventually lined a 3-2 pitch for a two-run single.	Off to a slower-than-usual start this year, Harper homered twice this week during a three-game sweep of the Mets in New York.	LaRoche and Wilson Ramos singled home runs in the third to make it 5-0.	The Pirates got to Roark in the fourth. Neil Walker doubled and Marte connected for his sixth homer. Alvarez then doubled home a run with two outs to pull Pittsburgh within 5-3.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: RHP Stolmy Pimentel (right ankle sprain) was placed on the 15-day disabled list. ... SS Jordy Mercer, who left Thursday's game with right forearm tightness, wasn't in the lineup. Mercer, who had started 49 straight games, grounded out as a pinch hitter. ... Walker, who had missed 11 of the past 12 games with back tightness, started and went 1-for-4.	Nationals: RF Jayson Werth (right shoulder) missed his fourth straight game. Williams said Werth was available to pinch hit and could return to the lineup Saturday, or more likely Sunday. OF Nate McLouth (right shoulder inflammation) is going to get a second opinion on his ailing shoulder. "It's not responding as well as he'd like it to respond," Williams said.	UP NEXT	Pirates: LHP Jeff Locke (4-3, 3.98) makes his second career start against the Nationals. He allowed three earned runs in five innings of a no-decision on May 4, 2013, at PNC Park.	Nationals: LHP Gio Gonzalez (6-9, 4.00) is 2-0 with a 3.28 ERA in four career starts against the Pirates. His teams (Nationals 3-0, A's 1-0) are undefeated in those games.	CANADA CONNECTION	The Pirates activated RHP John Axford, who was claimed off waivers from the Cleveland Indians on Thursday, reuniting him with fellow Ontario, Canada native Russell Martin. The pair played together for Team Canada when they were 18. "I put a lot of faith and trust in Russ not only just because he's Canadian, but he's a great catcher as well," Axford quipped before Friday's game.

DETROIT -- Lloyd McClendon spent last fall hoping to get a chance to manage in a pennant race at Comerica Park.	He got his wish Friday night, even if it wasn't exactly the way he had envisioned things.	McClendon had hoped to become the Tigers' manager when Jim Leyland retired after winning three straight AL Central titles, but general manager Dave Dombrowski picked Brad Ausmus over Leyland's longtime hitting coach.	McClendon ended up managing the Mariners instead, and made his return to Comerica Park with a 7-2 victory. After the game, though, he didn't want to make a big deal out of his first game back or the fact that the win moved Seattle a half-game ahead of Detroit in the race for the second AL wild card.	"This was the first win of the series," he said. "Other than that, no, it was no more significant than another game."	James Paxton (3-0) was the star for Seattle, pitching six innings and allowing one run on five hits. Robinson Cano homered, and he and Logan Morrison each scored twice as Seattle won its fifth straight and ninth in 11 games.	"That kid has a really nice downward angle on his fastball, and you end up hitting a lot of grounders and choppers off him," Ausmus said. "We actually hit some balls hard, but it seemed like they all went to the shortstop [Chris Taylor], and he just kept making play after play."	The Tigers dropped 1½ games behind first-place Kansas City in the AL Central, thanks to a 12-17 stretch since the All-Star break.	"Obviously, we'd rather be in first place by 15 games, but we're not," Ausmus said. "There's nothing we can do about what we've done up until now. You just go out tomorrow and try to start winning games again."	Rick Porcello (13-8) struggled badly in his first appearance since pitching the final three innings of Detroit's 19-inning loss in Toronto on Sunday.	After a five-start stretch in which he had a 1.75 ERA, the 25-year-old righty gave up six runs -- five earned -- and 10 hits in six innings. He didn't walk a batter, but struck out only three.	"The game in Toronto had nothing to do with what happened tonight," he said. "I had plenty of time to get ready for this start, and I prepared just like I always do. I just didn't pitch well."	Seattle jumped out to a quick three-run lead in the second.	Following a leadoff single and a hit batter, Morrison and Endy Chavez each hit an RBI single. Taylor bunted for a single, loading the bases with none out, but ex-Tiger Austin Jackson grounded into a double play, helping Porcello to escape only down 3-0.	An inning earlier, Jackson received a long standing ovation when he led off his first game at Comerica Park since the trade-deadline deal that sent him to Seattle and brought ace pitcher David Price to the Tigers.	"That was a special moment for me," said Jackson, a fan favorite in Detroit for his defense in center field. "Once the game started, it was business as usual, but that was fun."	Cano made it 4-0 with a long homer on the first pitch of the third. After the Tigers got on the board in the bottom half, Taylor restored the four-run lead with an RBI single in the fourth, and Detroit never threatened again.	"The run in the fourth was the one that really frustrated me, because we were still within 4-1, and with this offense, that's manageable," Porcello said. "Our guys were battling out there, and I couldn't keep them in the game."	MIXED-UP BOBBLEHEAD	The Tigers gave away Miguel Cabrera bobbleheads that depict him holding his two MVP trophies. The only problem? The trophies say "Most Valuable Player, National League", which would be news to Buster Posey and Andrew McCutchen, who won the 2012 and 2013 NL MVP awards, respectively, while Cabrera was winning in the AL.	UP NEXT	The Tigers and Mariners square off again Saturday night with a marquee pitching matchup. Price (11-8) will make his third start for Detroit, and Seattle counters with Felix Hernandez (12-3).	Hernandez, who made his major league debut at Comerica Park, is 9-0 in his past 11 starts against the Tigers, but will be facing Price for the first time.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: With the big lead, Cano left in the eighth inning, partially as a precaution after fouling a pitch off his foot early in the game. He isn't expected to miss any time. ... OF Michael Saunders (oblique) resumed his rehab stint with Triple-A Tacoma after missing time for the birth of his child. In five games with Tacoma, he was hitting .353 with a .542 on-base percentage.	Tigers: RHP Justin Verlander (shoulder) isn't scheduled to pick up a baseball until Tuesday, when he will try some short tossing. Ausmus said Verlander's schedule will be based entirely on how he feels then, but the hope is still that he will start next Friday in Minnesota.	MAJOR LEAGUE DEBUT	Tigers reliever Melvin Mercedes made his major league debut with two perfect innings, needing just 23 pitches. He became the 11th player to make his debut with the Tigers this season.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

BOSTON --  The Houston Astros had no shortage of reasons to celebrate.	The Astros ended a franchise winless streak at Fenway Park with a pesky performance, rallying to tie Boston twice before finishing off the Red Sox in extra innings.	Jake Marisnick hit a two-run double with two outs in the 10th on Friday night for a 5-3 victory, giving the Astros their first win in nine games at Fenway Park. With their 51st win of the season, the Astros matched last year's total.	"It's a huge credit to the players in that locker room and our staff," manager Bo Porter said. "They worked extremely hard and we still have six weeks left to go in the season."	Gregorio Petit entered as a pinch runner in the eighth inning and scored twice, including the tying run in the eighth on a wild sequence that withstood two challenges by Boston. The Red Sox lost both -- and the game, ending their winning streak at four.	The Astros tied it after falling behind 2-0, then 3-2 before taking their first lead in the 10th after loading the bases with none out against reliever Craig Breslow (2-4). Boston got two quick outs that kept Houston from scoring, but Marisnick delivered with a blooper that bounced just inside the right-field line and into the stands for a ground-rule double.	"You can't defend a bloop double down the line," Boston manager John Farrell said.	The ending was almost anticlimactic compared to the way Houston tied it in the eighth with hustle and a little bit of good fortune.	Petit came all the way around from second base on a fielder's choice after Dexter Fowler slid safely into second to beat shortstop Xander Bogaerts' throw to Dustin Pedroia, who saw Petit had rounded third and fired a strike to Christian Vazquez at the plate.	Petit sidestepped out of range for Vazquez to tag him and lunged toward home, getting a hand safely on the plate.	"When I first looked I knew I was going to be out. The throw was there way before I was," Petit said. "Then at the end of the play, I'm safe."	Boston reliever Burke Badenhop dropped the short throw from Vazquez, so Petit was going to be safe regardless. Boston still challenged the call at home and the play at second to no avail.	Both calls were upheld.	The Astros tacked on two runs in the 10th, then Tony Sipp (3-2) shut down the Red Sox in order to end it.	NO DECISION	Houston starter Dallas Keuchel's night was done long before the game was decided. He struck out eight while holding Boston to three runs on six hits and three walks over seven innings. Then he watched as his teammates completed the comeback.	"Fifty-one wins right now and we've got six weeks left. I think we're surprising a lot of people," Keuchel said. "It's a great win tonight. First win at Fenway, which is pretty cool."	NO CYCLE	Rob Grossman's solo homer in the seventh tied it 2-all. He drove the first pitch he saw from Clay Buchholz out to right and finished 3 for 5, just a triple shy of the cycle.	CHANGE IS GOOD	Marisnick went 2 for 5 and increased his batting average to .315 with the Astros since he was traded by Miami at the deadline. Marisnick, who was hitting .167 for the Marlins in 14 games, is 17 for 54 in 14 games with Houston.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: Porter said the Astros aren't taking any chances with LHP Darin Downs, who is sitting out a little while because of discomfort in his right oblique. Although Porter described it as "minor," the Astros called up LHP Kevin Chapman from Triple-A as Downs rests.	Red Sox: C David Ross (plantar tendon) took batting practice and is doing footwork with his shin guards on. He has been on the disabled list since Aug. 2.	UP NEXT	RHP Brad Peacock (3-8, 5.25 ERA) faces the Red Sox for the first time since a very short outing in Houston on July 13. Peacock was pulled with one out in the first after Brock Holt hit a leadoff homer, then Boston loaded the bases on a single, a walk and a hit batter.	Boston RHP Rubby De La Rosa (4-4, 3.21) tries to win back-to-back starts for the second time this season. De La Rosa, who won consecutive starts in July but then lost his next two, held the Angels to one run on five hits and struck out eight over seven innings Sunday.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

NEW YORK --  When Zack Wheeler put the first two batters on in the second inning, he dialed it up with three strikeouts. When he saw how his pitch count was a bit high, he threw more to contact.	Either way, everything is starting to work for the rising star.	Wheeler struck out 10 in a gritty performance, Eric Campbell hit a three-run homer and the New York Mets beat the free-swinging Chicago Cubs 3-2 Friday night.	"When he gets you in certain situations, those guys, they don't know what's coming," said manager Terry Collins, complimenting Wheeler's assortment of pitches. "They just can't sit on one pitch."	Wheeler (8-8) threw a career-high 120 pitches in 6 2/3 innings, allowing two runs and four hits. He walked four and hit a batter but overpowered the Cubs in winning his fifth consecutive decision.	"The big thing is trying to keep my pitch count down and I really haven't been able to do that," Wheeler said when talking about going deeper in games.	The Cubs entered having struck out 77 times in their previous seven games, including 16 on Thursday in a loss to Milwaukee. Five of their first six outs Friday came by the K, and they fanned 14 times overall.	Pitching with a hernia, Jenrry Mejia fanned one in a perfect ninth for his 18th save.	"We have been facing some pretty good pitching. This guy today was pretty good, too," Cubs manager Rick Renteria said. "When you face arms like that, it happens. I thought we had a lot of really strong at-bats in terms of driving his pitch count up."	Travis Wood (7-10) gave up three runs and four hits in 5 1/3 innings to drop to 0-5 in his last 11 starts.	The Mets rebounded from a dreadful three-game sweep at the hands of the NL East-leading Washington Nationals to beat the Central's last-place Cubs for just the first time in four meetings between the teams this season. Chicago swept three games at Wrigley Field in June.	"We need to start playing better, there's no doubt about it," Campbell said.	The Cubs took a 2-0 lead in the third -- the one inning Wheeler did not record a K -- behind Anthony Rizzo's run-scoring groundout and Starlin Castro's RBI single.	Campbell hit the second homer of his career an out after Wood walked David Wright and Lucas Duda.	"Walks killed me," Wood said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: Luis Valbuena is being held out of the starting lineup Friday and Saturday. Renteria thinks the scuffling infielder needs a break. Valbuena also has a cold. He grounded out as a pinch-hitter to end the game to fall to 1 for 30.	Mets: Right-hander Daisuke Matsuzaka (elbow inflammation) will make a rehabilitation start for Double-A Binghamton on Saturday. Collins says he is not sure where Matsuzaka will fit when he returns.	UP NEXT	Cubs: Right-hander Dan Straily, obtained in the trade that sent Jeff Samardzija to Oakland on July 5, will make his Cubs debut. Renteria said Straily is being called up from Triple-A Iowa to give the rest of the rotation an extra days' rest. The team is in a stretch of having a game on 20 straight days. OF Junior Lake is being sent to Iowa.	Mets: Jonathon Niese (6-8) is 2-4 with a 5.26 ERA against the Cubs. Castro is 5 for 16 (.313) with a homer and five RBIs against the left-hander	WISHFUL THINKING	Some Mets fans recently have called for their beleaguered team to make a deal with the shortstop-rich Cubs for Castro. If Castro, who is signed with Chicago through 2019, has his say, he'll stay right where he is. "I know a lot of teams could have me and want me, but I'm here and I don't want to leave here," Castro said.	THAT DIDN'T WORK	When Juan Lagares hit a one-out fly to right field in the sixth, Campbell took off running. Collins said he was given a steal sign, but Campbell was at third base before he turned back. Ryan Sweeney made an easy throw into the infield for the double play. Rizzo, the first baseman, dropped the ball and catcher Wellington Castillo had to pick it up and step on the base for a rare 9-3-2 double play.	IT'S OFFICIAL	The Mets gave OF Chris Young his unconditional release. Young, who is making $7.25 million this year, was designated for assignment last week after hitting .205 with eight homers and 28 RBIs in 254 at-bats.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

MIAMI --  The Arizona Diamondbacks started fast and held on late.	Aaron Hill and Cliff Pennington hit home runs in the first inning for the Diamondbacks, who beat the Miami Marlins 3-2 on Friday night.	All five runs in the game were scored in the first inning.	"We hit some balls hard with three runs and then they scored two in the first and our pitching shut them down," Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson said.	Trevor Cahill (3-8) pitched 6 2/3 innings, allowing two runs and six hits. Addison Reed pitched the ninth for his 29th save in 34 chances.	Marlins starter Brad Hand (2-5) allowed three runs in seven innings.	The Marlins, trailing 3-2, loaded the bases in the seventh, but Matt Stites got Donovan Soloano to ground into a fielder's choice to end the scoring threat.	The Marlins threatened again in the eighth, but Jarrod Saltalamacchia bounced into an inning-ending double play, one of four turned by the Diamondbacks.	"They hurt us tonight for sure," said Marlins third baseman Casey McGehee, who grounded into two of the four. "It's going to happen from time to time, but it doesn't make you feel any better about it."	Pennington hit his first homer since May 1, 2013, against San Francisco, and Hill added a two-run shot, his 10th of the season.	"I'm going up there just looking for something up," Hill said. "I typically don't swing at the first pitch, but it worked out and it ended up being all right."	The Marlins responded with RBI singles by Giancarlo Stanton and Garrett Jones.	"That's the beauty of the big leagues," Marlins manager Mike Redmond said. "Both teams come out swinging the bats and then zeroes the rest of the way."	Diamondbacks rookie Ender Inciarte extended his hitting streak to 15 games with a single in the fifth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: LHP Matt Reynolds (Tommy John surgery) threw live batting practice to SS Chris Owings (left shoulder strain) in Scottsdale, Arizona.	Marlins: RHP Henderson Alvarez is expected to rejoin the rotation on Saturday after missing two starts with right shoulder inflammation.	"He threw a bullpen the other day and he looks great," Redmond said. "...Whatever stillness he had is gone and he's ready to go."	ON DECK	Diamondbacks LHP Wade Miley (7-8, 4.61) will oppose Alvarez (8-5, 2.48), who is 5-2 with a 1.48 ERA at home. Miley is 2-1 with a 0.89 ERA in three career starts against the Marlins.	SHOW AND GO	With the Diamondbacks in the middle of a season-high, 10-game road trip, which included a pair of long nights in Cleveland, Gibson elected to give his team extra time off before the game. The team showed up just two hours before game time and did not partake in batting practice.	"Experience just tells you that it's something smart to do," Gibson said. "Mentally it's a good lift for them to give them a little extra time to chill out and do some other things and not overthink things."	The plan is the same for Saturday, which excited the players.	"It's funny, you should have heard the reaction from everybody when (director of team travel) Roger (Riley) yelled it was show and go," Hill said. "We obviously can't do it every day, but on a long road trip. It's funny how a bunch of grown men get excited about the little things."	POSTGAME MOVE	Marlins RHP Anthony DeSclafani was optioned to Triple-A New Orleans to make room for Alvarez, who will be reinstated from the disabled list on Saturday.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Now that they're back at the break-even point, the Tampa Bay Rays want to keep going and going.	Alex Cobb pitched neatly into the eighth inning and the Rays became just the fourth team in major league history to reach .500 after falling 18 games under in the same season, beating the New York Yankees 5-0 Friday night.	"Really proud of the boys," manager Joe Maddon said. "It was not easy."	The Rays won their third in a row and sent New York to its fifth straight loss.	Tampa Bay also accomplished the comeback feat in 2004 when known as the Devil Rays. The 1899 Louisville Colonels and 2006 Florida Marlins have also gotten back to .500 after dropping 18 under.	The Rays, now 61-61, were 24-42 on June 10. They are trying to become the first club to finish with a winning record after being so far under.	"It started with Joe and not letting us believe that we were that team," Cobb said. "It's mind-boggling that we went through the stretch we did, but we're back on track now."	Cobb (8-6) gave up six hits in 7⅓ innings, striking out eight and walking one. He improved 4-0 in six career home starts against the Yankees.	"Fabulous," Maddon said.	Cobb landed awkwardly on his left foot after fielding Brett Gardner's grounder in the sixth. He said the foot is fine, but expects some stiffness Saturday.	After giving up a single to Derek Jeter that loaded the bases, Brad Boxberger struck Jacoby Ellsbury and Mark Teixeira.	"We didn't score," New York manager Joe Girardi said. "That was the problem."	Tampa Bay has held its opponents to three runs or less in a club-record 11 consecutive games.	Brandon McCarthy (4-2) gave up four runs and seven hits over 6⅓ innings. New York has scored a total of seven runs during its current skid, which includes a pair of shutouts.	The Rays took a 2-0 lead in the first on RBI grounders by Evan Longoria and James Loney.	Loney homered in the eighth when Esmil Rogers tried to quick-pitch him.	Curt Casali singled home a run and Ben Zobrist hit the Rays' third RBI grounder of the game during the seventh as Tampa Bay took a 4-0 lead.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: C Brian McCann could be activated from the seven-day concussion list this weekend. ... RHP Masahiro Tanaka (right elbow) will have his first bullpen session Saturday.	Rays: CF Desmond Jennings (sore left shoulder) was back in the starting lineup after missing two games.	BOXER TIME	Boxberger has allowed just one hit in 56 at-bats against left-handed hitters since May 21.	"I don't want [to talk about it]," Maddon said of the right-hander's success. "Let them figure it out."	JETER METER	Jeter, who is retiring after the season, had two singles in four at-bats after getting a partial standing ovation before his first at-bat.	UP NEXT	Rays LHP Drew Smyly (7-10) and Yankees rookie RHP Shane Greene (3-1) are Saturday's scheduled starters. Smyly will make his first home start since being obtained from Detroit in a three-team deal July 31 that sent Tampa Bay ace David Price to the Tigers.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ATLANTA --  Freddie Freeman said before the game the slumping Braves needed an immediate turnaround.	The power-hitting first baseman then backed up his challenge at the plate.	Freeman hit a three-run homer, one of four by Atlanta, and the Braves beat the Oakland Athletics 7-2 on Friday night in the opening game of the interleague series.	Justin Upton and Evan Gattis hit homers off Jason Hammel (1-5) in the second inning. Rookie Phil Gosselin hit a two-run homer, the first of his career, off Jesse Chavez in the sixth.	The Braves had not scored more than four runs in any of their past six games. They entered the game having lost 12 of 15.	Atlanta is six games behind first-place Washington in the NL East.	"Everyone wants to say we can't panic, but we've got to go," Freeman said before the game. "... The time is now."	After the game, Freeman applauded Atlanta's power surge.	"That was a good night," Freeman said, noting Oakland brought the majors' best record to Atlanta.	"We always play those teams the hardest, and it was no different tonight," Freeman said.	Alex Wood (9-9) allowed two runs in six innings -- a two-run homer by Nate Freiman in the fourth.	The A's have lost three straight and five of six.	"We're just going through a tough time right now," Oakland manager Bob Melvin said. "You start to press a little bit offensively and it can be contagious as a group. You start swinging at some pitches out of the zone. We're pretty good about looking for our pitch and waiting for it. We haven't been as good here recently."	Wood allowed four hits in six innings. Relievers David Carpenter, Jordan Walden and James Russell combined for three perfect innings.	Hammel allowed five runs and six hits, including three homers, in three innings. He was pulled after walking B.J. Upton to open the fourth.	"Three-run homers do some damage," Hammel said. "Solo ones you can deal with, but that third one obviously was a big one.	"Otherwise I felt great. My body hasn't felt that good in a while."	The Braves had their second four-homer game of the homestand and only their fourth game with four or more homers this season. They also hit four homers in a 7-6 win over Washington on Aug. 8.	Before that, the Braves hadn't hit four homers in a game since May 25 against Colorado. Their high mark was five homers at Philadelphia on April 14.	Freeman's homer, his 17th, drove in Jason Heyward and Gosselin, who reached on singles. Justin Upton leads Atlanta with 22 homers.	Chris Johnson was credited with a ground-rule double when A's centerfielder Coco Crisp lost his deep fly ball in the lights in the third. The ball landed well behind Crisp and bounced over the wall. Hammel hit Gattis with a pitch and then escaped the jam.	A NIGHT OF FIRSTS	Gosselin's first homer came in his first start at shortstop. He previously started two games at second base and one at third.	His homer followed a two-out fielding error by Freiman, the first baseman, on Heyward's grounder.	"It was awesome just to contribute to a win tonight and get the series off on the right foot," Gosselin said.	OVERTURNED	After Wood issued one-out walks to Jonny Gomes and Josh Donaldson in the first, the left-hander made a pickoff throw to second base. Umpire Ted Barrett called Gomes safe. Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez challenged the ruling and the call was overturned following a review of 1 minute, 50 seconds.	The ruling proved important when Derek Norris followed with a single to left field that likely would have driven in Gomes from second.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: CF Craig Gentry, on the 15-day disabled list with a broken right hand, will take batting practice with Triple-A Sacramento on Saturday.	Braves: LF Justin Upton started after leaving Thursday night's game with a mild left hamstring strain. ... SS Andrelton Simmons was held out after having two teeth extracted.	UP NEXT	Athletics: RHP Sonny Gray will try to snap a streak of losses in three straight starts in Saturday night's game. The three-game skid is the longest of his career.	Braves: RHP Julio Teheran will try to improve his 2/3 career interleague record in his first appearance against Oakland. He is 1-2 with a 2.41 ERA in two starts against AL teams this season.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- Kole Calhoun is embracing his role leading off for the Los Angeles Angels. And he's doing it well.	Calhoun opened the game with a single and added a double before his tiebreaking, three-run homer that put the Angels ahead to stay in a 5-4 victory over the Texas Rangers on Friday night, when Garrett Richards worked into the eighth inning for his 13th win.	"I want to be a catalyst for the offense, get on base, score some runs," Calhoun said by phone after initially making a quick exit from the clubhouse after the game. "I want so bad to get on base. ... I'm having fun right there."	Calhoun, who finished a triple shy of the cycle, was also hit by a pitch. He had multiple hits for the fifth time in his past six games.	"He kind of flies under the radar, but I don't know if there are too many leadoff men as dynamic as Kole has been," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.	Richards (13-4), who struck out seven without a walk in 7⅓ innings, has won all four of his starts this season against Texas. The right-hander allowed two runs while scattering seven hits.	"He's been the same every time," said Adrian Beltre, who got three of his four hits off Richards.	Angels catcher Chris Iannetta said Richards is "coming into his own."	"We're just seeing him mature," Iannetta said. "He's got great stuff, and he's starting to command it more."	The Angels led for good after Calhoun's 412-foot shot off Nick Martinez (2-9) into the second deck of seats in right field made it 4-1 in the fifth. Another run scored when Calhoun grounded into a double play in the seventh.	Huston Street worked a perfect ninth for his eighth save in as many chances since the Angels acquired him. He has 11 scoreless innings in 11 games since the July 18 trade from San Diego, where he had 24 saves.	Martinez struck out six while allowing four runs and six hits in six innings.	"Just one unexecuted pitch, the one to Calhoun. He wanted to go down and away, and ended up pulling it across the middle of the plate," Texas manager Ron Washington said. "Other than that, I thought he did a swell job."	STRIKE THREE -- TIMES FOUR	Josh Hamilton was 1-for-5 with four strikeouts, then hit an opposite-field bloop single off a pitcher making his major league debut. Hamilton is 5-for-38 (.132) over his past 10 games, and without an RBI in his past nine. "We're not seeing the aggressive Josh Hamilton that we saw when he played for Texas. We're not seeing that," Scioscia said. "There's a lot of things that he's trying. Josh is working very hard, and nobody feels worse than Josh. We need him in the middle of our lineup doing what he can do."	PRODUCTIVE BOTTOM	David Freese and Iannetta, the bottom two batters in the Angels' lineup, were a combined 5-for-7 with four runs. Calhoun's 13th homer came after Freese and Iannetta started the fifth with consecutive singles. Freese has an 11-game hitting streak.	ONE BAD NIGHT	Angels reliever Kevin Jepsen has been spectacular lately, allowing only two earned runs over 39 innings in his previous 44 games. But the right-hander gave up two runs while getting only one out after relieving Richards in the eighth. Jepsen leads the majors with 54 scoreless appearances.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: Rookie RHP Mike Morin is expected to be activated from the 15-day disabled list Saturday, the first day the reliever is eligible to come back after missing 13 games with a cut on his left foot. Morin threw a scoreless inning for Class A Inland Empire on Thursday night before joining the team in Texas. He is 3-3 with a 2.36 ERA in 41 games.	Rangers: Alex Rios was back in RF for the first time since Sunday, when he re-aggravated a right ankle sprain on a slide. After being the DH the previous two games, he did some early work in the field before starting in the outfield.	UP NEXT	Los Angeles goes for its ninth consecutive win against the Rangers, which would match its longest streak in the series, a mark set from 1985-86. Matt Shoemaker tries to become the Angels' third 11-game winner in the middle game of the weekend set. Colby Lewis (8-9) starts for Texas.

CHICAGO --  Jose Abreu and the Chicago White Sox didn't need to play long ball to blast the Toronto Blue Jays on Friday night.	Abreu had three singles and three RBIs to increase his major league-leading total to 89, and the White Sox had 17 hits in an 11-5 victory.	Adam Dunn, who also had three hits, and Dayan Viciedo each drove in two runs. Seven White Sox starters had at least two hits and only one, Tyler Flowers, went hitless as Chicago had 14 singles and three doubles.	Abreu is in a three-way tie for the major league lead in homers with 31, but hasn't slugged one since July 29. White Sox manager Robin Ventura is still impressed with his rookie first baseman.	"I think you're looking at the professional side of his hitting," Ventura said. "I think everybody goes through a stretch where you don't quite have that feeling to hit homers.	"Don't try to do too much. Don't be the hero," he added. "Not trying to hit it over the fence. Just put it in play and good things will happen."	Melky Cabrera hit a two-run homer for the Blue Jays, who have lost four straight and 10 of 13 to drop four games behind Seattle in the AL wild-card race.	Hector Noesi (7-8) settled down after allowing four runs in the first two innings and pitched five-plus innings for his fourth win in five decisions. Javy Guerra, Maikel Cleto and Daniel Webb allowed one hit over the final four.	Ventura said he pulled Noesi because he had been hit in the thigh by a batted ball and the area was tightening. But Noesi, who won with his mother watching in the stands, had ample offensive support.	"It was good because my location was a little off today." Noesi said. "I was trying to fight a little bit."	Marcus Stroman (7-4) gave up five runs, five hits and hit a batter while getting only two outs in his shortest outing since joining the Blue Jays' rotation on May 31.	"It's disappointing because we scored four runs in the first two innings and I couldn't help my team keep in position to get a win," Stroman said.	Blue Jays slugger Edwin Encarnacion was hitless as the DH after being activated from the 15-day disabled list before the game.	Ten of the first 15 White Sox hitters reached base as Chicago scored five runs in the first inning and added one in the second. Viciedo singled twice in the span and drove in two runs.	The Blue Jays scored a run in the first and three in the second against Noesi, including Cabrera's two-run shot, to make it 6-4.	The White Sox added five runs in the fifth to put it away. They opened the inning with six straight singles -- a season high for consecutive hits -- a walk and wild pitch against Todd Redmond, Toronto's second reliever.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays	Encarnacion, a two-time All-Star, missed more than a month because of a strained right quadriceps muscle. He has played 70 of 91 games this season at first base, but manager John Gibbons plans to ease Encarnacion back onto the field.	"He'll have to play first base, but he was running guarded a little bit," Gibbons said. "If we don't have to, we'll let him DH the first few games anyway."	The Blue Jays sent outfielder Anthony Gose to the Triple-A Buffalo to make roster room for Encarnacion. They also optioned RHP Chad Jenkins to Buffalo after the game.	White Sox	Outfielder Avisail Garcia, out since April 9 (torn labrum in left shoulder) has progressed in a rehab stint at Triple-A Charlotte and could be back as early as this weekend, according to Ventura. Garcia has 17 hits in 50 at-bats (.340), the number of plate appearances Ventura said Garcia needed to reach.	UP NEXT	Toronto LHP Mark Buehrle (11-8, 3.31) will face Chicago LHP John Danks (9-8, 4.96) on Saturday. Buehrle will take the mound at U.S. Cellular Field for the first time since leaving the White Sox three years ago.	Buehrle has made two starts in Toronto (1-1) against Chicago, where he pitched for the first 12 years of his career.	ACT YOUR AGE	How has Buehrle, the former White Sox ace who's now 35, changed since leaving Chicago following the 2011 season?	"Ten pounds heavier, throw slower," he said. "I'm not as agile on the mound as I used to be. My body hurts."	POWERING UP	Adam Lind rejoined the Blue Jays from the DL on Tuesday in Seattle at was at first base on Friday. Lind has just four homers and 27 RBIs in 63 games with a .319 average, but last year hit 23 homers with 67 RBIs.	The Blue Jays are counting on him and Encarnacion for an offensive boost down the stretch.	"Early in the season when we were winning a lot of games, a lot of it was we were scoring a lot of runs," Gibbons said. "These guys are a big part of our team."	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MINNEAPOLIS -- For almost three seasons, Josh Willingham's family was there to greet him outside the Twins' clubhouse at Target Field.	Willingham's family was waiting for him again on Friday, only this time the slugger came out of a different door.	Willingham returned to Target Field and hit a bases-clearing double in Kansas City's five-run fourth inning, and the surging Royals hung on to beat the Minnesota Twins 6-5.	When Willingham popped his head out of the visitor's clubhouse after the game, his three young sons ran excitedly to be with their dad in his new surroundings.	"I knew it was going to be a little strange playing against your former team," said Willingham, who was traded from the Twins to the Royals four days ago. "I'm just happy we won the game tonight."	Danny Duffy (8-10) allowed three runs in 5 1/3 innings to win his third straight start. Kansas City has won 11 of 12 and sits atop the AL Central.	This one didn't come easy, though.	Oswaldo Arcia hit an RBI double in the ninth and pinch-hitter Chris Parmelee drove him in with a groundout to cut the Royals' lead to 6-5. But Greg Holland struck out Danny Santana for his 37th save in 39 chances.	After Minnesota took a 2-0 lead in the third, the first six Royals hitters reached base to start the fourth off Ricky Nolasco (5-8). Willingham drilled a bases-loaded double down the left-field line to make it 3-2.	Two batters later, Alcides Escobar tripled to score Willingham and Mike Moustakas. Escobar also blooped an RBI single in the eighth to make it 6-3.	Nolasco made his first start since going on the disabled list July 8 with an elbow strain. He struck out three and looked sharp in every inning besides the fourth.	The right-hander signed a four-year, $49 million free agent contract in the offseason, the richest free agent deal in Twins' history, and now has a 5.99 ERA.	"I don't think it's about building confidence up with a guy like him, it's about results and we need to get results out of him," Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said. "We need to see him get going stronger and more consistent, and giving us a chance."	After Duffy was removed, Aaron Crow and Francisley Bueno finished the sixth inning before Kelvin Herrera, Wade Davis and Holland preserved the victory.	That trio has allowed only four runs over the last 44 1/3 innings, including two by Holland on Friday. The Royals are 19-4 over that span.	Kurt Suzuki had three hits for Minnesota.	BACK-T0-BACK REVIEWS.ALMOST	Third-base umpire Chris Segal called Trevor Plouffe safe after Royals C Salvador Perez tried to pick him off in the fourth. The call stood after a 3-minute, 23-second replay review. Two pitches later, Plouffe scored when Arcia grounded into a double play. Gardenhire wandered out of the dugout to consider challenging the Arcia call, but returned without challenging.	HOLLAND TIRED	"I'm wearing Greg out. I can't find any way to get him a break," Royals manager Ned Yost said about his closer. "It's more my fault than it is his, but he's so good, you just have to do it."	THE BODY GETS BOOED	Former Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura was booed loudly when he and his wife were shown on the Target Field big screen for "kiss cam." Ventura has been in the news recently after winning a $1.8 million defamation lawsuit against the estate of "American Sniper" author Chris Kyle. It's probably the loudest Ventura has been booed since he wore a feather boa and wrestled as a bad guy at the old St. Paul Civic Center in the glory days of the AWA.	TRAINER'S ROOM:	Twins: Top prospect Byron Buxton will head to the Twins' facility in Fort Myers to rehab from a concussion suffered during an outfield collision while playing for Double-A New Britain on Wednesday night.	Royals: After a Thursday X-ray showed he's not ready to return, 1B Eric Hosmer won't have his fractured right hand examined again until after the Royals' current 10-game road trip ends.

ST. LOUIS --  Lance Lynn needed only 16 days to get even with the San Diego Padres.	The St. Louis right-hander pitched six strong innings to help the Cardinals beat the Padres 4-2 on Friday night for their third straight win.	Matt Adams, Kolten Wong and Oscar Taveras hit RBI singles for St. Louis. San Diego has lost two in a row after a five-game winning streak.	Lynn (13-8) gave up one run and six hits, striking out six and walking one. The Padres handed him a 3-1 defeat on July 29.	Lynn actually felt as though he pitched better in San Diego last month when he allowed one earned run and four hits over six innings.	"Tonight was a grind from the get-go," Lynn said. "It could have been better."	St. Louis manager Mike Matheny disagreed, saying Lynn was at the top of his game.	"Lance was great," he said. "Another good night of using his fastball, mixing in the two-seam and four-seam. He had a real nice feel for all of his pitches."	Lynn has allowed two runs or fewer in 11 of his last 13 starts.	"He just goes out there and battles every day and gives us solid starts," Wong said. "You have a pitcher like that, it definitely increases the morale of the team and makes us want to continue to play well."	The Padres took a grind-it-out approach at the plate, fouling off 21 pitches in Lynn's 102-pitch stint.	Pat Neshek posted his fourth save. Regular closer Trevor Rosenthal was given the night off after two successive appearances.	Pinch-hitter Yasmani Grandal homered with two outs in the ninth for the Padres. After Chris Nelson doubled, Neshek struck out Will Venable.	Tyson Ross (11-11) gave up three runs and five hits over six innings. He walked four and hit two batters.	Ross walked the first three batters in the first, and Adams hit an RBI single. Jhonny Peralta followed with a run-scoring groundout.	"I didn't have fastball command the first inning," Ross said. "It was that simple. I put myself in a big hole, and they capitalized on it."	Wong pushed the lead to 3-0 with an RBI single in the fourth. It was his team-high 27th RBI with two outs.	San Diego got within 3-1 on a double by Venable in the fifth. Lynn retired Tommy Medica and Seth Smith with runners on second and third to preserve the lead.	The Padres have scored in the ninth inning in the first two games of the series.	"These guys play hard," San Diego manager Bud Black said of the Cardinals. "They play all 54 outs and beyond at times. That's just the way we play. It's what we do."	Taveras had a pinch-hit single in the eighth.	The Cardinals are 22-7 at home against San Diego since 2006.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: 1B Yonder Alonso is on the 15-day disabled list after straining his right forearm in Tuesday's 4-1 win over the Rockies. It is his second stint on the DL this season. He missed 30 games with right wrist tendinitis from June 19 to July 26.	Cardinals: C Yadier Molina was able to do some light throwing on Thursday, 35 days after undergoing surgery to repair a torn ligament in his right thumb. Matheny indicated that Molina is progressing at a faster rate than first expected. He was projected to miss eight to 12 weeks, but appears ahead of schedule.	"I can't wait to grab a bat and see how the hand reacts," Molina said.	UP NEXT	St. Louis RHP Shelby Miller (8-9, 4.17) faces RHP Jesse Hahn (7-3, 2.52) in the third game of the four-game series on Saturday. Miller has given up a team-high 17 home runs and walked a team-high 58 batters in 133 2/3 innings.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DENVER -- Johnny Cueto took off his hat, tucked his glove inside it and cradled them both like a football in his left arm as he sauntered ever-so-slowly off the mound after each inning.	This was his little routine and it was working effectively for him.	Of course, so were his almost unhittable cutter and four-seam fastball.	Cueto threw eight stellar innings to become the first 15-game winner in the majors and Kris Negron had a career-high four hits, including a tiebreaking single in the ninth, as the Cincinnati Reds beat the Colorado Rockies 3-2 on Friday night.	Cincinnati's ace came through in a big way. Cueto (15-6) allowed two runs and six hits to help the Reds snap a three-game skid. He is 7-0 since a loss at San Diego on July 2.	"As a manager, it's very comfortable being able to put your stock into one guy," Reds skipper Bryan Price said. "You go all in with Johnny and you don't fear losing the game late."	Nolan Arenado was about the only Rockies hitter who was making good contact against Cueto. Arenado homered and had two deep fly outs. After watching Billy Hamilton catch his drive to center in the eighth, Arenado passed by Cueto and grinned at something the pitcher said.	"He was saying, You just missed that,'" Arenado recounted. "He's one of the best in the league. He's an animal. As the situation and innings got tighter, he got better."	Negron lined a two-out single up the middle off Adam Ottavino (0-4) to bring in Ramon Santiago with the go-ahead run.	Aroldis Chapman closed for his 26th save in 28 chances. Charlie Culberson drew a one-out walk and pinch hitter Mike McKenry sent a shot down the line that first baseman Brayan Pena -- who started the game at catcher -- snared as he toppled over. Pena then touched first base with his glove to double up Culberson.	Cueto worked his way out of a jam in the sixth after giving up a tying RBI double to Corey Dickerson. With one out and the bases loaded, Cueto struck out Culberson with a 95 mph fastball and then fanned DJ LeMahieu with the same pitch.	The hard-throwing righty splintered quite a few bats with his heavy pitches running in on the hands of hitters.	"His cutter is just filthy," Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. "There's a reason why he's been as successful as he has been."	The Rockies turned reliever Matt Belisle into an emergency starter when Franklin Morales was a late scratch after his wife went into labor. Belisle and five other relievers kept the game close until the ninth.	Belisle allowed one run and tossed a season-high 49 pitches in three innings. It was his first start since May 25, 2008, with the Reds.	"When you sign the contract, it doesn't tell you when you're going to pitch," Belisle said. "I looked at it as a great opportunity."	FAMILY AFFAIR	Negron picked quite a game to have his parents and grandmother fly in from California. He jokingly said he's going to have them take him to the same restaurant and then sit in the same seats Saturday.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: 3B Todd Frazier was out of the starting lineup with a balky back, which he hurt the night after hitting a ball off the end of his bat. "Pain shot up the right side of my back," Frazier said. He said he thinks it's a muscle strain in his lower back. He's day-to-day.	Rockies: Weiss said it "sounds like things went well" with SS Troy Tulowitzki's hip surgery Friday in Vail. OF Carlos Gonzalez will have surgery on his left knee Monday.	UP NEXT	Reds: RHP Dylan Axelrod is expected to be brought up from Triple-A Louisville on Saturday to fill in for injured Homer Bailey, who's headed to the disabled list with a strained right elbow. It will be Axelrod's first major league start since last September.	Rockies: RHP Jordan Lyles (6-1, 3.70 ERA) will make his third start since returning from the DL. He missed two months with a broken left hand.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

LOS ANGELES --  Lyle Overbay has found his niche with the Milwaukee Brewers, batting .444 as a pinch hitter.	He drove in three runs with a two-out double in the eighth inning for a 6-3 comeback victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Friday night in a game between division leaders.	Overbay is now 8 for 18 coming off the bench, with two doubles, a home run and seven RBIs.	"It's just something where I kind of throw out mechanics and throw out everything and just look for a pitch to hit, put a good swing on it and hope for the best," he said. "I've kind of found some holes this year, but I've been put in situations that I can succeed in."	Brewers manager Ron Roenicke considered putting in Elian Herrera before settling on Overbay.	"Lyle's been so good off the bench, and with people on base," Roenicke said. "That hit was huge."	The NL Central-leading Brewers scored five runs in the eighth off Jamey Wright (4-3), who gave up four hits and walked one.	"I'm the reason why we lost this game," Wright said.	The Brewers tied their season high for runs in a single inning.	"If we're going to be the best, we have to beat the best," Overbay said. "As a team, we don't panic. We'll grind it out and find ways to win. We're not a patient team, but we've made adjustments so we can score runs even if we're struggling."	Brandon Kintzler (2-3) got the victory, giving up one hit in one inning of relief.	Milwaukee tied the score 2-all on Scooter Gennett's RBI single and Khris Davis' run-scoring double after Wright allowed four consecutive hits, Milwaukee's first since getting two hits in the first inning.	Brandon League struck out pinch-hitter Rickie Weeks before Overbay doubled to left, scoring Gennett, Davis and Mark Reynolds, who was intentionally walked, for a 5-2 lead.	Francisco Rodriguez pitched the ninth for his 37th save.	"It's huge, especially with the pitching staff they have," Rodriguez said. "We had to take advantage of every single opportunity we got and try to get some runs. They've got a pretty good bullpen, too."	Ryan Braun went 1 for 3 with a walk and was roundly booed in his return to Milwaukee's lineup after being held out for a game with a sore right hand. He scored the Brewers' first run.	Yasiel Puig went 3 for 4 and had a pair of RBI singles that pushed across the NL West leaders' first two runs. He scored on Matt Kemp's sacrifice fly to make it 5-3 in the eighth.	Facing the Brewers for his second straight start, Zack Greinke allowed two hits in five innings, equaling his second-shortest outing of the season. He struck out six and tied his season high with five walks. The right-hander struggled with his control, giving up two-out walks three times.	"I wasn't really sharp," Greinke said. "All those walks built up my pitch count (99) some. As much power as they've got in that lineup, you really don't want to make any mistakes. It's mainly not attacking enough."	Jimmy Nelson gave up two runs and six hits in six innings. He struck out four and walked one in his second straight outing against the Dodgers, who beat him 5-1 last Sunday.	RISING RAMIREZ	Milwaukee 3B Aramis Ramirez went 2 for 4 with a walk and a run, raising his career average to .367 with three homers and eight RBIs in 13 games against the Dodgers.	FIRST PITCH	New Lakers coach Byron Scott threw a strike in handling the first pitch. "It's an unbelievable feeling," he said about returning to the team where he starred with Dodgers co-owner Magic Johnson. "My heart has always been in Los Angeles."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: RHP Kyle Lohse will miss his scheduled start Tuesday because of a sore right ankle. Mike Fiers will take his regular turn in the rotation that day. ... SS Jean Segura left the game with a bruised right hand.	Dodgers: LHP Hyun-Jin Ryu became the sixth Dodgers player to go on the disabled list this month. He has a right hip strain and will be replaced in the rotation by newly acquired right-hander Kevin Correia. Ryu had an MRI on Friday that showed strains in muscles that help stabilize the hip and leg during his throwing motion. ... INF Juan Uribe was taken out as a precaution in the seventh with tightness in his right hamstring.	UP NEXT	Brewers: RHP Yovani Gallardo (7-6, 3.44 ERA) makes his first start of the season against the Dodgers. Opponents are batting .252 against him, and the team is 11-13 in his starts. He is 1-4 with a 5.98 ERA in his career against Los Angeles.	Dodgers: LHP Clayton Kershaw (14-2, 1.78) makes his second straight start against the Brewers. He allowed a run on six hits in eight innings against them last Sunday in a 5-1 victory. The left-hander struck out six and walked two on 100 pitches.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Cody Asche took one look at the starting lineup and felt his confidence grow. Phillies manager Ryne Sandberg challenged him, and that was enough.	Asche hit a two-run homer in the eighth inning to tie the game and then started the decisive rally with a double to open the 10th as Philadelphia rallied to beat the San Francisco Giants 5-3 on Friday night.	"He saw something in me that made him want to put me in," Asche said. "I was confident just by the fact I was in there."	Chase Utley was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded in the 10th and Ryan Howard followed with a sacrifice fly against Javier Lopez, snapping the Phillies' three-game losing streak.	Sandberg gave Andres Blanco the day off and went with Asche against Madison Bumgarner.	"If you want a chance to become a regular player, you have to face lefties," Sandberg said.	Asche connected against Jeremy Affeldt, who allowed his first home run this season, and doubled off Santiago Casilla (1-3) to set the stage for the winning rally.	Ken Giles (2-0) pitched two scoreless innings, and Jonathan Papelbon worked the 10th for his 28th save in 31 chances.	Bumgarner threw seven strong innings for his first quality start at home since June 10, a span of seven games. He allowed one run and four hits, striking out nine without a walk.	"It was nice to pitch a good game at home," Bumgarner said. "It's been forever."	Cole Hamels also delivered a quality start for Philadelphia, giving up three runs and nine hits over seven innings. He walked two and struck out five.	Pablo Sandoval had three hits, but the Giants lost their sixth in seven games.	Bumgarner retired the first 10 hitters he faced, five on strikeouts, before allowing back-to-back hits by Jimmy Rollins and Utley.	Hamels let the leadoff hitter reach base in five innings and had baserunners every inning. He was able to avoid trouble with the exception of the fourth.	Buster Posey led off with a single and Sandoval hit a ground-rule double ahead of Michael Morse's first home run in August, a three-run drive into the left-field seats.	Marlon Byrd countered with his 23rd homer leading off the fifth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: OF John Mayberry Jr. continues to deal with inflammation in his left wrist. His recovery has been interrupted by minor setbacks following workouts.	Giants: 1B Brandon Belt will get another opinion on his concussion when the Giants visit Chicago next week. Belt will see concussion specialist Michael Collins in Pittsburgh.	UP NEXT	Phillies: RHP Kyle Kendrick (5-11, 4.88 ERA) takes the mound Saturday afternoon. He is 1/3 in his past six starts and has an ERA of 6.98 over his last seven.	Giants: RHP Tim Hudson (8-9, 2.81) pitches Saturday. The Giants have lost seven of his last 10 starts. Hudson has started 30 games against the Phillies and is 11-10 with a 3.60 ERA against them.	BYRD IS THE WORD	Giants third base coach Tim Flannery sent Sandoval home with two outs in the eighth on Joe Panik's single to right. Byrd's throw to Carlos Ruiz was there in plenty of time, keeping the game tied.	"Defense always comes first," Byrd said. "I'm not always going to hit, and I take pride in my defense."	Byrd also ran down Morse's 400-foot fly in the second to the roomy area of the ballpark known as Triples Alley.	COOL LIKE CARLTON	Hamels had his streak of pitching at least seven innings and allowing no more than one earned run stopped at five games, one shy of matching the franchise record. Steve Carlton was the last Phillies pitcher to do it, in 1972. Grover Cleveland Alexander (1916) and Elmer Jacobs (1918) also accomplished the feat.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN FRANCISCO --  The San Francisco Giants may have found their answer at second base. Joe Panik is showing he belongs in the lineup.	Panik tripled and scored on Gregor Blanco's tiebreaking single in the eighth inning, helping the Giants beat the Philadelphia Phillies 6-5 on Saturday.	Panik, one of eight players the Giants have tried at second, also had an RBI single in San Francisco's four-run rally in the sixth. The rookie is batting .410 (16 for 39) in his last 11 games.	"I feel like I've hit my stride here," Panik said. "When you first come up, everything is new to you. Once I got settled in, I got a feel for everything."	Michael Morse had two doubles and a triple as San Francisco won for the second time in three games following a five-game skid. Blanco went 2 for 2 with two RBIs.	"The bats came to life and we started placing the ball well," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "That picks up the energy. It's a great win, particularly after the loss we had last night."	Ryan Howard had three hits and three RBIs for the Phillies, who have lost six of eight. Ben Revere went 4 for 5.	Five San Francisco relievers combined for five scoreless innings after Tim Hudson struggled, giving the Giants time to rally. Jeremy Affledt (3-1) pitched 1 1/3 innings for the win and Sergio Romo got the final two outs for his 23rd save.	Panik led off the eighth with his first career triple and Blanco, who entered as a pinch hitter in the sixth, singled past a drawn-in infield. Antonio Bastardo (5-7) took the loss.	"I got to two strikes and I was just battling," Panik said. "I tried to put a good swing on the ball and I was fortunate enough to hit the gap."	Hudson was charged with five runs and eight hits in four-plus innings.	"I wasn't really in synch," Hudson said.	The Phillies scored three times in the fifth to take a 5-1 lead. Howard had a two-run single against Hudson, improving to .343 (24 for 70) for his career against the right-hander.	Kyle Kendrick pitched five innings for the Phillies, yielding four runs and eight hits.	Buster Posey sparked San Francisco's rally in the sixth with a leadoff single. Pablo Sandoval then hit a high pop fly that dropped between Howard and second baseman Chase Utley. Posey reached second when Utley's backhanded flip took Jimmy Rollins off the base.	"I felt Chase behind me and I heard him say something," Howard said. "All I heard was `Got it.' Talking to him later, he was saying `You got it.' It was a small communication mistake and it started a rally."	Morse doubled home a run and pinch-hitter Adam Duvall drew a walk. Panik and Blanco each followed with soft fly balls that fell in front of outfielders for run-scoring singles.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: RHP Mike Adams (right labrum fraying) is on a long-toss throwing program. He last pitched in a game on June 6.	Giants: C Hector Sanchez was held out of Friday's rehab game with Triple-A Fresno as he continues his rehab assignment since being cleared to play following a concussion. He was 3 for 18 in his first six games with the Grizzlies.	WHAT'S NEXT	Phillies: RHP David Buchanan (6-3, 4.40 ERA) makes his third start since returning to the majors for his second stint. After allowing seven home runs in his first five starts, Buchanan has allowed two over his last seven. The Phillies have won eight of their last 13 games at AT&T Park.	Giants: RHP Tim Lincecum (9-8, 4.51 ERA) gets the ball in Sunday's series finale. He is 5-3 in 13 career appearances against the Phillies.	THE KENDRICK FILE	Kendrick can't seem to catch a break when he starts during the day. He left Saturday's game with a lead but ended up with a no-decision and is 1-10 over his last 16 daytime starts.	"He's a competitor," Utley said. "I don't blame him for being frustrated for coming out of the game."	He gave up a first-inning drive by Hunter Pence for the eighth homer he's allowed in the opening frame. He's allowed 25 first-inning runs in his 25 starts.	Kendrick declined comment.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Derek Jeter almost felt as if he were playing in the Bronx after getting a key late hit.	Jeter had a tiebreaking single in the ninth inning and the New York Yankees ended a five-game skid with a 3-2 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays on Saturday.	The announced crowd at Tropicana Field was 31,042, the Rays' second home sellout this season. Tampa Bay entered with the major league's lowest average home attendance of 17,848.	"There are a lot of Yankees' fans down here because spring training is here," Jeter said. "Seemed like quite a few were in the stands, so it's almost like a home game."	Jeter is retiring after this season and playing in his final weekend games at Tampa Bay. The Yankees do return for three weekday games in September.	"I'm not so sure I've heard his name chanted that loud in an opposing stadium this year," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.	Brett Gardner opened the ninth with an infield single off Jake McGee (3-1) and advanced on a throwing error by second baseman Logan Forsythe. After failing to lay down a sacrifice bunt, Jeter put New York ahead with a single to right-center on a 2-2 pitch.	"This game is funny, you know," Girardi said. "It changes on a drop of a hat."	Dellin Betances (5-0) worked a perfect eighth before David Robertson got three outs for his 32nd save.	Rookie Shane Greene allowed two runs, seven hits and struck out a career-high 10 in six-plus innings.	The Yankees took a lead in the second when Chase Headley drew a two-out walk on a full-count pitch and Martin Prado homered on an 0-2 offering from Drew Smyly, making his first home start since being acquired in a trade that sent ace David Price to Detroit on July 31.	Smyly gave up two runs and four hits over seven innings.	"They've got a really good lineup," Smyly said. "They have good strike zone awareness. You just have to keep going right at them and making them swing."	Price is scheduled to pitch against Tampa Bay for the first time Thursday in the finale of a three-game series in Florida.	After Yunel Escobar had a sixth-inning RBI single, Tampa Bay tied it at 2 on Ben Zobrist's run-scoring grounder in the seventh.	The Rays extended their club-record streak of allowing three runs or fewer to 12 consecutive games, but have gone just 7-5 over the stretch.	Tampa Bay had become the fourth team ever in the majors to get back to .500 after being at least 18 games under the break-even point with a 5-0 victory Friday night over the Yankees that gave them a 61-61 record.	TRAINERS' ROOM	Yankees: RHP Masahiro Tanaka (right elbow) threw 25 pitches during his first bullpen session since going on the DL July 9. C Brian McCann (concussion) might return Sunday.	Rays: OF David DeJesus (left hand) went 0 for 1 with a walk in his first Gulf Coast League game.	JETER METER	The Yankees captain has 20 career game-winning RBI hits against the Rays, which is second most against Tampa Bay. Boston's David Ortiz tops the list with 26.	BELTRAN BACK	Yankees RF Carlos Beltran played defense for the first time since mid-May. After a DL stint that went into early June due to a right elbow bone spur, he had been limited to DH. Beltran said he will have surgery on the elbow after the season.	ON THE MOVE	Tampa Bay recalled INF Vince Belnome from Triple-A Durham and optioned reliever Brandon Gomes to the International League club. Belnome went 0 for 2 with a walk.	UP NEXT	Yankees RHP Hiroki Kuroda (7-8), 0-3 in his last four starts against Tampa Bay, and Rays RHP Jeremy Hellickson (1-1) are Sunday's scheduled starters.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CLEVELAND --  Carlos Carrasco has gone from the starting rotation to the bullpen to back to being a starter again. He'd like to keep it that way.	"That's my job," he said. "I just want to stay there."	Carrasco improved his job security by shutting out AL East-leading Baltimore on three hits over seven innings, lifting the Cleveland Indians to a 6-0 victory over the Orioles on Saturday night.	Carlos Santana hit a three-run homer in the first off Ubaldo Jimenez (4-9) and Michael Brantley added a two-run shot in the fifth as the hot-and-cold Indians won for the fifth time in six games. Jimenez, who pitched the Indians to the postseason in 2013, lost to his former teammates for the second time this season.	Carrasco (5-4) got two inning-ending double plays to avoid early trouble and then retired 15 straight after giving up a leadoff double in the third.  It's the second straight strong outing for Carrasco, who won for the first time in 17 decisions -- since June 29, 2011 -- in his last start at New York.	"I think he's better equipped to pitch," manager Terry Francona said. "I think he feels good about himself. I think being out in the bullpen helped him a lot. It let him settle in and get his confidence and kind of understand who he is. It's a big lift for us."	The Orioles have lost consecutive games for the first time since June 28-29.	Inconsistent starting pitching has been a problem for the Indians all season, and Francona has been waiting for someone to step up.	Carrasco could be the guy. The right-hander, who went 0-3 with a 6.95 ERA in his first four starts, hasn't allowed a run or walk in 12 consecutive innings.	Carrasco has always had electric stuff and the Indians have held out hope he would figure things out. Pitching exclusively out of the stretch, he threw five shutout innings against the Yankees last week, and if he continues to pitch the way he has lately, he'll hang onto his starting job for a while.	"We talked about him wanting a spot in the rotation this spring," Francona said, "and now he has gone out and earned it by what he's done. That should be really rewarding for him because he deserves it."	Cleveland's unreliable defense -- the Indians lead the majors in errors -- turned double plays to end the first and second innings behind Carrasco. In the ninth, right fielder Chris Dickerson ran down Steve Pearce's shot to the track, preserving the shutout.	Santana staked Carrasco to a 3-0 lead in the first with his 21st homer, a 422-foot shot to center.	Jimenez came in leading the AL in walks, and he put Michael Bourn and Jose Ramirez on to start the inning. One out and a passed ball later, Santana made his former batterymate pay with a towering blast into the shrubs behind the center-field wall.	"He didn't get off to a good start," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said of Jimenez. "He walked the first two guys and the next thing you know we're down 3-0."	Brantley's 18th homer capped a three-run fifth to make it 6-0.	KLUBER'S REST	Not wanting to take any chances with ace Corey Kluber, the Indians will push his next start back to Thursday at Minnesota. Kluber has been the AL's most dominant pitcher for two months.	SANTANA'S SHOT: His homer was the 92nd of his career, tying him with former Indians All-Star catcher Sandy Alomar for 28th on the team's career list.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: CF Adam Jones played despite soreness in his right hand, which was hit Friday night when he tried to get down a bunt.	Indians: Bourn returned to center field and the leadoff spot after being sidelined since July 6 with a troublesome hamstring. He went 0 for 2 with a walk, sacrifice and scored once.	UP NEXT	Orioles RHP Kevin Gausman, 2-1 with a 3.21 ERA in five starts, will try to salvage the series finale. For the Indians, enigmatic RHP Danny Salazar will be recalled from the minors to make his 13th start. The hard thrower began the season in Cleveland's rotation.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

WASHINGTON --  After Adam LaRoche's two-run homer in the eighth tied the game, and Wilson Ramos' ground-rule double in the ninth won it, Washington Nationals manager Matt Williams called his club "tenacious."	Kevin Frandsen, whose RBI single in the eighth started Washington's rally from a three-run deficit, went with the word "relentless."	No matter what you call it, these NL East-leading Nationals are showing a knack for coming through late in games, and their fifth walkoff win of the season came by the score of 4-3 against the Pittsburgh Pirates on Saturday night.	"When you're on a streak, when you've got a little lead in the division, it's easier to go relax and play," said LaRoche, who hit his 18th homer, "and not get too uptight late in games, regardless (of whether) you're down or not."	Trailing 3-0 heading into the eighth, Washington grabbed its fifth consecutive victory to stay six games ahead of the second-place Atlanta Braves.	The Pirates, meanwhile, dropped their fourth straight and have fallen to third place in the NL Central.	"It's never good for the club, especially the position we're in right now, pushing hard," said Tony Watson, who came on in the eighth and gave away the lead.	Watson began his appearance by walking pinch-hitter Michael Taylor, then giving up singles to Denard Span and Frandsen that made it 3-1. After a double play, Watson faced the lefty-hitting LaRoche, who drove a 1-0 pitch into the home bullpen. Reliever Drew Storen, who was warming up, caught the ball on the fly.	Watson said he followed the same pitch sequence against LaRoche on Saturday as he had Friday.	"Yeah," Watson acknowledged, "it was dumb."	In the ninth, with another lefty in for Pittsburgh, Justin Wilson (3-3), Bryce Harper checked his swing at a 3-1 pitch and went about halfway down the first-base line, figuring he had a leadoff walk. But plate umpire Mark Wegner had called the pitch a strike. Harper eventually paused, turned around, got back in the batter's box -- and walked on the next pitch.	After Harper took second on a wild pitch, Ramos hit a ball that sailed over right fielder Gregory Polanco's head and bounced into the home bullpen to win it.	Helped, too, that Washington got four innings of scoreless relief after starter Gio Gonzalez allowed three runs and departed after 102 pitches in five innings.	Craig Stammen got nine outs -- "Just carving," Harper said -- before Matt Thornton (1-0) earned the win with a 1-2-3 ninth, getting a pair of strikeouts on 96 mph fastballs.	"They believe that they can come back, they believe that they can string hits together and we can score runs, and that's a good thing to have," Williams said. "That belief system is good."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: CF Andrew McCutchen, last season's NL MVP, ran the bases and hit before Saturday's game as he works his way back from a broken rib that put him on the 15-day disabled list retroactive to Aug. 4. McCutchen had run before, but manager Clint Hurdle said "this was just a little bit more; closer to 100 percent." ... Hurdle said RHP Gerrit Cole "passed all the tests" during a minor league rehab start Friday and should be ready to come off the DL within the next week.	Nationals: RF Jayson Werth sat out a fifth consecutive game because of a bothersome right shoulder. Williams, who initially hoped to have Werth back Sunday, said the outfielder was "a little tender" after doing a full workout Saturday. "So if we have to take another day after today, we may have to do that," Williams said.	UP NEXT	In the series finale, Nationals RHP Doug Fister (12-3, 2.34 ERA) faces Pirates RHP Edinson Volquez (10-7, 3.67 ERA). Fister has won six of his last seven starts; Volquez has won six of his last seven decisions.	WHAT A PLAY	Pirates LF Travis Snider made a head-first, all-out, diving catch to rob Harper of a hit with a man on in the fifth.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

DETROIT -- David Price got into a sticky situation in the eighth, and Brad Ausmus decided to leave the ace in the game.	Price then rewarded his manager for the vote of confidence.	Price wriggled out of the jam in his final inning, and the Detroit Tigers snapped Seattle's five-game winning streak with a 4-2 victory over Felix Hernandez and the Mariners on Saturday.	The Tigers had a three-run lead when the Mariners loaded the bases with one out in the eighth. When Ausmus came out of the dugout, Price was sure his night was done.	"I've never had a manager come out in the middle of the inning and not pull me," he said. "That had never happened."	But Ausmus just wanted to check in with Price, who is 1-0 with a 3.18 ERA in three starts since he was acquired from Tampa Bay in a three-team trade last month.	"This is only David's third game for us, so I'm not used to how he handles himself late in the game," Ausmus said. "I went out there to ask him if he was OK, he gave me a very definitive answer, and I went back to the dugout."	Price (12-8) then struck out Austin Jackson -- one of the players Detroit traded for him -- and then got Dustin Ackley to ground into a force at second.	"That was a huge moment for me," Price said. "I wanted to finish that inning off, so I looked Brad straight in the eye and told him I was good to go. I didn't want to be one of those pitchers who looks down and mumbles that he's OK. I wanted to make sure he knew I was ready."	Hernandez was pulled after five innings and 92 pitches. He allowed two runs and seven hits, struck out three and walked none.	Hernandez was hit on his left hip by Ian Kinsler's comebacker on the third out of the fourth inning, and took another glancing blow from a ball hit by Miguel Cabrera in the fifth.	"He's fine, we just took him out as a precaution after he got hit again by Miguel in the fifth," Mariners manager Lloyd McClendon said.	Hernandez (13-4) lost his record streak of 16 straight starts of at least seven innings and no more than two runs. Hernandez broke Tom Seaver's major league mark of 13 straight earlier this month.	"I'm fine -- I'm going to live," Hernandez said. "I was throwing a lot of pitches tonight, especially at the beginning of the game. I wasn't missing by much.	"The streak's over, but I'll start a new one soon."	Joe Nathan pitched the ninth, allowing one run while picking up his 25th save. It was his first appearance since making a profane gesture at Comerica Park fans on Wednesday, and he received a mixture of cheers and boos when he was introduced.	"I apologized on Thursday, but I still feel terrible for my actions, so I want to apologize again," said Nathan, who didn't celebrate after the final out. "I'll keep apologizing until the fans understand how upset I am that I let my frustration get the best of me. I don't want my entire career to be known for three seconds of anger."	Nick Castellanos hit a solo homer in the fourth for Detroit. He also had a two-out RBI single in the Tigers' two-run seventh.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Seattle: Cano was back in the starting lineup one day after fouling a pitch off his foot. Cano played several more innings after the painful foul ball, only leaving when the Mariners built a comfortable lead, and was fine to play against Price.	Detroit: Cabrera needed the attention of Tigers trainer Kevin Rand after taking a Hernandez fastball just above the left elbow. The impact caused Cabrera's hand to go numb -- a day after he had stayed in Friday's series opener after injuring this thumb on the first play of the game -- but he stayed in the game after a short delay.	UP NEXT	The three-game series concludes with rookie Robbie Ray (1-2, 5.31 ERA) facing Seattle's Chris Young (11-6, 3.20 ERA). Ray, acquired in the Doug Fister trade last winter, is in his second stint with the Tigers, both to replace Anibal Sanchez in the rotation.	Young has never lost to Detroit in three career starts, going 1-0 with a 2.14 ERA.	BIG CROWD	The Hernandez-Price matchup, plus a post-game fireworks show, drew a sold-out crowd of 43,833 -- Detroit's sixth straight sellout.	ROSTER MOVE	The Tigers purchased the contract of reliever Jim Johnson from Triple-A Toledo and sent Melvin Mercedes back to the Mud Hens. Johnson posted 101 saves for Baltimore in the last two seasons, but he struggled with Oakland and was released on August 1.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

BOSTON -- David Ortiz's career with the Boston Red Sox has moved into elite territory.	Ortiz hit a pair of two-run homers, including his 400th shot in a Red Sox uniform, and drove in a career high-tying six runs to power Boston past the Houston Astros 10-7 on Saturday night.	Big Papi joined Hall of Famers Ted Williams and Carl Yastrzemski as the only players to hit 400 homers while playing with the Red Sox. Ortiz did it with his drive into the first row of the center-field seats in the third inning.	"It's an honor to be mentioned with those legends that were with the Red Sox," he said. "When you come to this organization to play, you're not expecting to be mentioned with those guys."	The left-handed slugger has joined a class that features two of the greatest players to wear a Boston uniform.	"He's in rare company with those two other guys he's linked to," Red Sox manager John Farrell said.	After his 400th, Ortiz hooked his other homer around the Pesky Pole in right field in the fifth. He has 459 home runs in his career, which started with Minnesota.	He then lined a two-run double into the gap in front of the Green Monster in the eighth. He left to a standing ovation for a pinch runner, tipping his helmet as the crowd gave him a curtain call.	"David Ortiz is a Hall of Famer. He's about as good as it gets in this game," Astros manager Bo Porter said.	Williams hit 521 homers, and Yaz had 452. Both spent their entire careers with the Red Sox.	Chris Carter hit a solo homer and added a sacrifice fly for the Astros, who lost for the fifth time in seven games. A day earlier, Houston earned the franchise's first win in Fenway Park after going 0-8.	The Red Sox trailed 6-3 before scoring four in the sixth. Ortiz's second homer off starter Brad Peacock sliced it to 6-5, and Daniel Nava's sacrifice fly tied it. Jackie Bradley Jr. had a sacrifice fly off Josh Fields (2-6) to push Boston ahead.	Alex Wilson (1-0) earned the victory with 2 1/3 hitless innings. Koji Uehara gave up a solo homer to Jason Castro and worked the ninth in a non-save situation.	The Astros built a 5-1 lead against Rubby De La Rosa by scoring two in the first, one in the second and two in the third.	Leading 3-1, Gregorio Petit had a two-run double.	After Ortiz's first homer cut Houston's lead to 5-3, Carter homered over the Monster in the fourth.	"One of the best players in baseball," Peacock said of Ortiz. "The first homer, it was a hanging changeup, bad 0-2 pitch, and he just did what he's supposed to do with it."	STEADY PAPI	Ortiz has 91 RBIs, giving him at least 90 for the 10th time in 12 seasons with the Red Sox. One other he finished with 89, and in 2012 he had 60 while played just a little over half of an injury-plagued season. It was his 45th career multihomer game and fourth this season.	FENWAY SUCCESS RUNS OUT	De La Rosa had allowed three or fewer runs in each of his Fenway starts this season -- and one or none three times. He gave up six on nine hits in just four innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: Porter said OF Alex Presley (strained right oblique) will be shut down for "seven to 10 days" after feeling discomfort during his minor league rehabilitation assignment at Tri-City of the New York-Penn League. Porter also said LHP Darin Downs, dealing with oblique soreness but still on the active roster, will "need a couple of more days."	Red Sox: 2B Dustin Pedroia was back in the lineup after leaving Friday's game after fouling a ball off his right foot. OF-1B Allen Craig, on the DL with a sprained left foot, is expected to start a rehab assignment, beginning Monday with Triple-A Pawtucket. He did some running during batting practice with a member of the team's medical staff watching. C David Ross (plantar fasciitis) is expected to be activated early next week.	UP NEXT	RHP Collin McHugh (5-9, 3.08 ERA) is scheduled for Houston on Sunday. RHP Joe Kelly (0-0, 2.08) is slated to make his Fenway debut with the Red Sox. He was acquired at the trade deadline from St. Louis along with Craig for RHP John Lackey.	HONORED	The Red Sox had a moment to honor Maj. Gen. Harold "Harry" J. Greene, who was killed in Afghanistan earlier this month. He was born in Boston and was a big Red Sox rooter. His family wore Red Sox jerseys and stood on top of the dugout when his picture was shown on the center-field scoreboard after the fifth inning. They received a standing ovation. Greene, the highest-ranking U.S. military officer killed in combat since the Vietnam War, was buried with full honors Thursday at Arlington National Cemetery.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

CHICAGO --  Mark Buehrle felt a little more nervous and a little more emotional than he thought he would. The pitcher received a standing ovation from the crowd as he took the mound against his former Chicago White Sox teammates.	Buehrle tipped his cap and then allowed three runs in 5 1/3 innings in his first start as a visitor in Chicago and third game against the White Sox overall.	The Toronto starter didn't earn a decision, but the Blue Jays beat the White Sox 6-3 on Saturday night. Melky Cabrera's two-run double in the seventh inning was the difference in Toronto's win.	"The reception I got, I was kind of thinking it might be good, but what they did, coming off the field every time I ran out, to hear people cheering, it was exceptional," Buehrle said.	Buehrle texted former teammate, and White Sox captain, Paul Konerko to make sure it was OK that he tipped his cap to the crowd.	"It's one of those things that I didn't want to (tick) anybody off on the other team, but at the same time the reaction I was getting from the crowd, I felt it was right," Buehrle said.	The Blue Jays, who snapped a four-game losing streak, scored three runs in the seventh to retake the lead after the White Sox tied it with three runs in the sixth.	Avisail Garcia went 2 for 4 with a double for the White Sox in his first game since April 9 after recovering from shoulder surgery.	Brett Cecil (1-3) got two outs -- both by strikeout -- to earn the win. Casey Janssen worked one inning for his 19th save in 22 opportunities.	The Blue Jays allowed Buehrle to take the field alone before the bottom of the first inning, and fans gave him a standing ovation.	While with the White Sox from 2000-11, Buehrle threw a perfect game on July 23, 2009, against Tampa Bay, and a no-hitter on April 18, 2007, against Texas.	"I'm kind of glad it's over," said Konerko, a teammate of Buehrle's on the 2005 World Series championship White Sox team. "Him in another uniform doesn't look right to me. Quite honestly, I really don't have it in me to want to see him do badly, so I don't like the combination."	The Blue Jays took a 2-0 lead on Dioner Navarro's sacrifice fly and Nolan Reimold's RBI single in the second. Toronto extended the lead to 3-0 in the fifth on Jose Reyes' RBI single.	The White Sox tied it with three runs in the sixth. With runners on first and second, Dustin McGowan replaced Buehrle.	"It was starting to snowball," Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said about removing Buehrle.	Both runners advanced on a wild pitch before Dayan Viciedo's sacrifice fly made it 3-2. Konerko tied it with a single, but the White Sox bullpen gave the lead back in the next inning.	The Blue Jays scored three runs with two singles, two doubles and a Chicago error. Matt Lindstrom (2-2) allowed four straight hits before recording an out.	Cabrera hit a two-run double and advanced on an error. Jose Bautista followed with an RBI single for a 6-3 lead.	Buehrle has one victory in his last 13 starts.	"I take pride going deep into games, and I didn't really go deep into the game today, so that's the frustrating part," he said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: 1B Dan Johnson began a rehab assignment with Triple-A Buffalo on Saturday. He is on the DL with a strained left hamstring. Toronto also called up RHP Kyle Drabek from Triple-A to replace RHP Chad Jenkins, who was optioned to Buffalo on Friday.	Drabek began the season in the Triple-A rotation, where he went 4-6 with a 4.46 ERA. After the first-round draft pick moved to the bullpen in mid-June, his numbers improved. In 16 relief appearances, he was 3-1 with a 2.77 ERA.	White Sox: Garcia was reinstated from the 60-day DL, and OF Moises Sierra (oblique) went on the 15-day DL on Saturday. The White Sox also recalled LHP Eric Surkamp from Triple-A Charlotte, placed RHP Javy Guerra on the bereavement list, and designated LHP Charlie Leesman for assignment before Saturday's game.	UP NEXT	In the finale of the three-game series Sunday, Toronto starts RHP Drew Hutchinson (8-10, 4.60 ERA) against RHP Scott Carroll (4-7, 4.81).	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Kurt Suzuki rarely makes errors or hits home runs. He did both on Saturday night, and the homer made up for a bad throw that could have cost Minnesota another game.	The All-Star catcher went 2 for 3 with a solo homer and made an impressive slide into home plate that helped lift the Twins over first-place the Kansas City Royals, 4-1.	Suzuki redeemed himself for an errant throw in the fourth that allowed Nori Aoki to score after stealing third and give Kansas City a 1-0 lead. The mistake came with his starting pitcher, Phil Hughes, looking dominant and locked in a duel with hard-throwing rookie Yordano Ventura.	"The hardest part is Phil was throwing so good and for me to do something like that, that's what really got me a little bit," Suzuki said.	It was his fourth error of the season.	"It was pretty brutal," Suzuki said. "It was just one of those things where you get your body moving too quick and I lost the ball probably about right before my arm started coming forward. I said, `This is not good."	It looked as if that run would be all the Royals needed to win their fourth straight. Ventura had dominated Minnesota's lineup with his power for most of the night, consistently hitting into the upper-90s.	Hughes (13-8) allowed one run, seven hits and struck out six over 7 1/3 to outlast the young righty.	"You just don't want to be the guy that breaks first," Hughes said. "Obviously in a situation like that, I knew that one run might not be good enough and I had to at least keep it there."	Ventura (9-9) threw six innings of one-hit ball before the Twins broke through in the seventh. With runners on second and third, Ventura threw a 99-mph fastball that shattered Danny Santana's bat -- but Santana reached base when Billy Butler tried to throw out Suzuki at home. The throw was in time, but the tag by catcher Salvador Perez was off, and Suzuki scored.	Brian Dozier followed with his 25th double of the season to score pinch-runner Eduardo Escobar. Kennys Vargas chased Ventura two batters later with a sacrifice fly to score Santana.	"You got to put up more runs than one," Butler said. "That's not the way it is every night, but that's the way it is tonight."	Hughes has won three in a row after losing three straight starts. He also has allowed only three runs this month. Casey Fien pitched to two batters in the eighth and Glen Perkins pitched the ninth for this 31st save in 34 chances.	SUZUKI'S HOMER SURPRISES:	Suzuki's solo homer in the eighth off Aaron Crow was his first since May 20, a span of 217 at-bats. Asked if manager Ron Gardenhire said anything to him in the dugout, Suzuki laughed and said: "Yeah, he said, `What happened? Where'd that come from?"	WALKS, WALKS AND MORE WALKS	Ventura struggled with his command, walking a season-high six batters and getting called for a balk in the third inning. Still, he had a no-hitter through four innings despite allowing six base runners. None of his walks came around to score. The Royals lost a game Ventura started for just the second time in the last nine starts.	"Command was off a little bit, but he did a nice job getting us to the seventh with a one-run lead," manager Ned Yost said.	TRAINER'S ROOM:	Twins: A week after severely spraining his right ankle, RHP Anthony Swarzak appears to be fine and has avoided the disabled list. "He came and did everything out in the pen yesterday, actually simulated running off the mound going to first base. He's fine," Gardenhire said.	UP NEXT:	Kansas City's Jeremy Guthrie (8-10) will pitch Sunday against Tommy Milone (6-3) in the third of this four-game series. Guthrie will try to bounce back from his previous start when he allowed six runs -- four earned -- against Oakland on Tuesday as the A's snapped the Royals' eight-game winning streak. Milone makes his second start for the Twins since being acquired from Oakland last month.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

ATLANTA --  The Braves are trying to use a visit from Oakland, who came to Atlanta with the majors' best record, to prove they shouldn't be dismissed in the NL playoff hunt.	Chris Johnson drove in two runs with three hits, Julio Teheran threw six strong innings and the Braves edged the suddenly struggling Athletics 4-3 on Saturday night.	"We're not giving up. We're not going to crumble," Johnson said after the Braves remained six games behind Washington in the NL East. Atlanta began the night two games behind the NL wild-card leaders.	The A's matched their worst skid of the season by losing four in a row as they fell percentage points behind the Los Angeles Angels in the AL West. It is the first time since April 28 they have not held sole possession of first place in the division.	"It's tough to go through this as a team, but I feel like everyone goes through it and maybe this is our time right now," said Sonny Gray, who gave up four runs in 5 1/3 innings.	"We've just got to go out there and play with confidence."	Oakland has dropped six of seven overall.	"They're a tough ballclub," Johnson said. "They've played really well all year. We're just trying to prove to ourselves we can play with them and we can stay in this thing."	Teheran (11-9) gave up two runs on four hits and three walks. The Braves had lost 12 of 15 before winning the first two games of the series.	Craig Kimbrel got his 36th save in 40 chances.	Manager Bob Melvin said Gray (12-7) had no breaks as he gave up eight hits and absorbed his fourth straight defeat.	"I thought he pitched well," Melvin said. "He got a little tired at the end but three of those hits are bloops; two of them scored runs."	There was a brief delay in the bottom of the sixth when a nude man ran onto the field. He was quickly tackled by security officers and taken off the field.	Stephen Vogt hit a two-run homer and John Jaso also homered for Oakland. The A's also lost four straight from May 22-25.	Atlanta closed it out after Josh Reddick led off the A's ninth with a long fly ball that Justin Upton caught at the left-field wall.	Freddie Freeman hit an RBI double and scored on Johnson's single to give Atlanta a 2-0 lead in the first. Upton led off the fourth with a single and scored on Andrelton Simmons' two-out, bloop single to left field for a 3-0 lead.	Upton walked to lead off Atlanta's sixth and scored from first on Johnson's third hit, a hit-and-run single to left-center.	Jaso's homer off Jordan Walden in the eighth cut the lead to one run.	THROW (WAY, WAY) BACK	Atlanta celebrated the 100th anniversary of the 1914 Boston Braves. The Braves and A's wore retro uniforms. The "Miracle Braves" spent much of the season in last place before rallying to earn a spot in the World Series, where they swept Connie Mack's Philadelphia A's. Oakland players all wore high socks with horizontal stripes while Braves players stayed with the 2014 style of wearing their pants over their socks.	HOT STREAK	Vogt is 11 for 30 (.367) with three homers and eight RBIs in his last eight games as he has recovered from a 0-for-21 stretch from July 20 to Aug. 6.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: SS Jed Lowrie, placed on the 15-day disabled list on Thursday with a broken right index finger, has remained with the team and has even fielded grounders. Melvin said Lowrie is trying to keep himself "as close to game-ready as he can without overtaxing the finger."	Braves: Simmons, who did not play on Friday night when he had a headache after having two teeth extracted, was back in the lineup. Phil Gosselin, who hit his first homer on Friday night while filling in for Simmons, started at second base and had two hits. ... RHP Shae Simmons (strained right shoulder) began a rehab assignment with Triple-A Gwinnett.	UP NEXT	Athletics: Jon Lester, who beat the Braves on May 27 while with the Red Sox, will look for his fourth straight win with Oakland. He has won seven decisions in a row overall.	Braves: Mike Minor, who is 1/3 with a 7.17 ERA in four starts since the All-Star break, will try to build on encouraging results in his last start, when he allowed three runs in 6 2/3 innings against the Dodgers. Minor has allowed a .372 batting average in those four starts.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

NEW YORK --  Wilmer Flores sure looked like a major league shortstop Saturday night, in every way possible.	Given an opportunity to play regularly of late, Flores finally provided a spark with his bat and glove in leading Jonathon Niese and the New York Mets to a 7-3 victory over the Chicago Cubs.	Juan Lagares drove in two runs and reliever Vic Black escaped a major jam unscathed to keep New York in control after Niese exited. Star third baseman David Wright also was removed in the seventh, one inning after he was hit in the upper back by an 88 mph fastball from Dan Straily.	The Mets, outhit 7-4, said Wright had a sore left shoulder.	"Just got me in a spot that's bothersome," said Wright, who missed time this summer with an injury to the same shoulder. "They thought it would be best to give it a little bit of a rest. More than anything, just unlucky with the spot that it got me."	New York manager Terry Collins said Wright was pretty sore and probably will get at least one day off.	The 23-year-old Flores, a touted hitting prospect trying to show he can play adequate defense at shortstop, followed Lagares' RBI double with a two-run single in the second.	Flores also made a diving stop and another difficult play in the hole to prevent base hits. He turned a pair of double plays, including one that got Niese (7-8) out of a bases-loaded jam after Chicago's first two batters reached on errors.	"I told him he's having tomorrow off. I guess he said, `I'm going to leave it on the field tonight," Collins said. "I asked him today how comfortable he was getting at shortstop and he said, `Look, I feel good any place you put me.' So I thought it was a pretty good statement."	Welington Castillo and Justin Ruggiano homered for the last-place Cubs, who have lost three straight.	Niese took a 7-1 lead into the seventh before giving up five straight hits, including Ruggiano's leadoff homer. The last one was a line-drive RBI single by pinch-hitter Ryan Sweeney that struck the left-hander on his pitching arm.	"Just hit my forearm. Got the meat, missed the bone," Niese said. "It's good."	Niese departed with the bases loaded and New York ahead 7-3. Black, who has excelled at stranding inherited runners, retired the top three batters in Chicago's lineup to stop the rally.	"He's been unbelievable. The job he's done to come in with guys on base is truly amazing. I mean, he has not flinched," Collins said. "His command is, I mean, it's 10 times better when there's guys on."	Niese had an RBI groundout in a four-run sixth, when the only Mets hit was a single by Travis d'Arnaud. Niese has won consecutive starts after dropping four in a row immediately following his return from the disabled list July 21.	Called up from Triple-A Iowa to make a spot start, Straily (0-1) retired 12 straight before suddenly losing his command in the sixth. He was charged with seven runs -- five earned -- and four hits over 5 1/3 innings in his Cubs debut.	"I think it went pretty well until I hit Wright and then it kind of unraveled for me," Straily said. "It's something that just can't happen."	After the game, Chicago sent Straily back down and recalled outfielder Matt Szczur from its top farm club.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: Rookie RHP Jacob deGrom (rotator cuff tendinitis) threw on flat ground and said he felt no pain. There is a good chance he'll throw a bullpen Sunday, Collins said. ... RHP Daisuke Matsuzaka (elbow inflammation) allowed one run and three hits over six innings in a rehab start for Double-A Binghamton. ... Collins said the Mets are concerned about all the punishment C Travis d'Arnaud is taking behind the plate on foul balls and backswings, especially since d'Arnaud has already had three concussions in his career.	UP NEXT	Mets rookie Rafael Montero (0-3, 6.12 ERA) tries again for his first major league win Sunday when he faces RHP Jake Arrieta (6-4, 2.77) and the Cubs. Montero has served up eight homers in 25 innings, the most in club history through five big league outings. He gave up four home runs in 75 innings at Triple-A Las Vegas this year.	MAKING THEM COUNT	New York has won consecutive games with four hits or fewer for the fourth time in team history, and first since 1989.	STREAK STOPPED	Chicago SS Starlin Castro went 0 for 4, ending his 14-game hitting streak. The last Cubs player to reach 15 was Aramis Ramirez, who had a 16-game run in August 2011.	SWING AND A MISS	The Cubs struck out 10 times to give them 40 Ks in the past three games and 101 in the last nine, six of them losses.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MIAMI --  Henderson Alvarez was a bit rusty. That didn't last long.	Alvarez made a successful return to the mound after missing two starts and pitched seven innings for the Miami Marlins who beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 2-1 on Saturday.	"He did a great job today and he's a unique player for sure," Marlins manager Mike Redmond said. "This guy competes and the beauty of Hendu is that, and I hope and think this is true, he's realized how good he is this year. This guy has great stuff and you saw that tonight."	Alvarez (9-5) allowed one run and five hits while striking out six after being reinstated from the 15-day disabled list with right shoulder inflammation. He lowered his home ERA to a National League-best 1.46 among qualifiers.	"I'm just thankful that everything went well today and I was able to go out there and help my team," Alvarez said. "We're in the middle of the (playoff) hunt so this is an important stretch for us."	Alvarez threw 58 of 89 pitches for strikes. Two offerings were his Eephus pitch -- one registered 58 mph on the radar gun -- before he was pulled after the seventh inning.	"Chuck (Hernandez) and I sat there and, believe me, we fought the urge to throw him back out there for the eighth, but decided that he did his job and knowing that was his first start back after being a little bit sore was the right thing to do," Redmond said.	Steve Cishek pitched the ninth for his 31st save in 34 opportunities.	The Diamondbacks made five errors, their most since recording six on July 3, 2010, against the Dodgers.	"Through all the mistakes we battled and we only gave up two runs, one unearned and one earned," Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson said.	Wade Miley (7-9) struck out nine in seven innings for Arizona. He allowed two runs -- one earned -- and four hits.	"It's a little frustrating, but that's baseball," Miley said. "Alvarez threw a great game."	The Marlins scored the go-ahead run in the seventh inning on the Diamondbacks' fifth error. Shortstop Cliff Pennington's throw home on a grounder went wide of catcher Miguel Montero, allowing Marcell Ozuna to score from third base. Ozuna moved into scoring position after a dropped pick-off attempt by first baseman Mark Trumbo.	Trumbo's sacrifice fly gave the Diamondbacks a 1-0 lead in the first, but Alvarez was able to escape further damage after the first three batters singled. Ozuna, the center fielder, threw out Ender Inciarte at home to help.	Arizona racked up three errors in the second inning, but the Marlins were unable to take advantage of the miscues. It was the first time in nearly four years a team (Oakland on Aug. 24, 2010) committed three errors in an inning without allowing a run.	Jeff Baker hit an RBI triple in the fourth for the Marlins.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: SS Chris Owings (left shoulder strain) will begin a rehab assignment with the Arizona League (rookie) Diamondbacks on Sunday and the plan is for him to play for Triple-A Reno on Friday. ...	CF A.J. Pollock (right hand surgery) will begin hitting on Monday.	ON DECK	Marlins RHP Tom Koehler (8-9, 3.86) takes the hill in Sunday's series finale against Diamondbacks RHP Josh Collmenter (8-6, 4.09). Koehler has allowed eight runs in nine innings over two starts, both losses, against the Diamondbacks. Collmenter is 0-1 with a 7.71 ERA over his last three starts.	ROTATION SHUFFLE	Redmond has decided to start RHP Jarred Cosart on Tuesday and RHP Nathan Eovaldi on Wednesday in a two-game set with the Texas Rangers. With two off days next week, the Marlins will not need a fifth starter until Aug. 24 and a decision has not been made whether LHP Brad Hand or RHP Brad Penny will assume that role.	STREAKS CONTINUE	Inciarte's career-long 16-game hitting streak is the longest active streak in the National League. He is hitting .314 (22 for 70) during that stretch. ... Trumbo also continued his streak of reaching base safely in 15 consecutive games, which is the second-longest streak of his career.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ST. LOUIS --  Jedd Gyorko's grand slam gave him a spot in Padres history and his team a come-from-behind victory.	Gyorko hit his third career grand slam and drove in five runs, sparking San Diego to a 9-5 rain-delayed victory over the St. Louis Cardinals on Saturday night.	It was Gyorko's 31st career homer and set the team mark for most homers by a Padres second baseman, surpassing Mark Loretta.	"It seems like once a game I come up with the bases loaded," Gyorko said. "That's a credit to the guys hitting in front of me. I have to capitalize more like tonight."	Gyorko's eighth homer came on an 0-1 pitch from Kevin Siegrist (1-3) with one out in the seventh. The Padres had loaded the bases on two singles and a walk before Gyorko's drive to left.	"It was a fastball down and in," Gyorko said. "It probably wasn't a bad pitch. I just put a good swing on it."	Rain then halted play later in the inning. The game was delayed 1 hour, 46 minutes and only a handful of the crowd of 44,079 stayed to watch the finish.	The Cardinals, who had won three in a row, dropped to three games back of Milwaukee for the NL Central lead. The Brewers beat Clayton Kershaw and the Dodgers 3-2.	"We get some offensive production early on; it's hard to see that go away," St. Louis manager Mike Matheny said. "We had two really rough innings that made for a bad day."	Alex Torres (2-1) earned the win when he got the last out in the sixth in relief of rookie starter Jesse Hahn. San Diego won for the sixth time in its last eight games.	"Our guys did a nice job and swung at strikes for both of our rallies," San Diego manager Bud Black said.	Matt Adams' two-out RBI triple in the fifth gave St. Louis a 5-4 lead. It was Adams' team-high fifth triple.	The Cardinals struck for four runs in the second. Jhonny Peralta hit a run-scoring double down the left-field line and scored on Oscar Taveras' one-out double that hit just in front of the wall in center.	Taveras returned to the starting lineup after two days on the bench. The rookie outfielder did have a pinch-hit RBI single Friday to snap a 2-for-20 slump.	Matt Carpenter added a two-run double for the Cardinals. Rymer Liriano tried to catch the line drive. It landed in front of him and bounced by.	But San Diego got the runs back against Shelby Miller in the third.	"It was good to see us come back against a good young arm like that," Black said. "I'm very happy for the guys and their at-bats."	Gyorko had an RBI single and rookie Jake Goebbert hit a bases-loaded triple with two down. He had four RBIs in his first 25 games.	"You get a four-run lead, you don't go out and give up four runs," Miller said. "Unacceptable. Obviously, it doesn't sit well with me. I should have done a better job of making pitches."	Seth Smith's third hit in the eighth drove the Padres' final run.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: 3B Yangervis Solarte returned to the lineup after missing two games with a mild left oblique strain. He was in the leadoff spot for the third time this season.	Cardinals: RHP Michael Wacha (right shoulder) threw 30 pitches off the bullpen mound before the game. He had not pitched off a mound since his June 17 start against the New York Mets. He will undergo an MRI on Monday to check the shoulder.	TARGET PRACTICE	St. Louis CF Jon Jay was hit twice by a pitch. He also was hit by a pitch twice Friday, giving him four in two games. He leads the major leagues with 14 hit by pitches.	CARDINALS HALL OF FAME	Willie McGee, Jim Edmonds, Mike Shannon and the late Marty Marion were honored Saturday with their induction into St. Louis' newly created Cardinals Hall of Fame.	UP NEXT	Rookie RHP Odrisamer Despaigne (3-3, 2.72 ERA) faces Cardinals ace Adam Wainwright (14-7, 2.34 ERA) in the finale of the four-game series. Despaigne pitched seven scoreless innings in a victory over Colorado in his previous start. Wainwright is 5-2 with a 1.47 ERA against the Padres. He is coming off a 3-0 loss at Miami in his last outing.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- It took the Los Angeles Angels 4½ months to catch the Oakland Athletics and move into first place in the American League West.	Albert Pujols and Howie Kendrick homered to give the Angels an early lead on the way to a 5-4 victory over the Texas Rangers on Saturday night.	The Angels (72-49) are alone in first place in the AL West for the first time since 2011, but they are only two percentage points ahead the Athletics, who lost at Atlanta on Saturday.	"We haven't accomplished anything yet," Pujols said. "Let's not get too far ahead of ourselves. When we accomplish our goal, then we can talk about it."	With his team in fifth place, Rangers manager Ron Washington talked about the division race.	"I think it's going to come down to who continues to pitch well," he said.	The Angels finished 78-84 and in third place during an injury-plagued 2013 season.	"It definitely feels good to be on the track we hoped to be on last year," manager Mike Scioscia said.	One reason for their improvement to the best record in the major leagues is a better bullpen.	Huston Street worked a scoreless ninth inning for his 33rd save in 34 opportunities. It was the second straight night the Rangers rallied before losing 5-4.	Los Angeles has won nine in a row over Texas, tying the series record set during the 1985 season and matched a year later.	Street hasn't allowed a run in 12 games with the Angels since being acquired from San Diego on July 18.	"He's just a bona fide closer," Scioscia said. "He has created an opportunity for us to shorten the game by moving (Kevin) Jepsen up to the seventh inning, and Joe Smith up to the eighth."	Angels starter Matt Shoemaker (11-4) pitched three perfect innings before Shin-Soo Choo led off the fourth with a home run, but by that time, the Angels led 5-0.	Kendrick added two singles in a 3-for-4 night. Kole Calhoun had a single and a double for the Angels, and Erick Aybar had two singles.	Pujols hit a solo homer in the first against starter Colby Lewis (8-10). Kendrick hit another solo shot in the second.	Los Angeles' Chris Iannetta doubled home another run in the second, and Calhoun singled to drive in two more in the fourth. Both hits, like Pujols' homer, were with two out.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: Los Angeles activated RHP Mike Morin (left foot laceration) from the disabled list. He pitched an inning in relief.	Rangers: Rios made his fourth consecutive start after aggravating a sprained right ankle on Aug. 10. RHP Yu Darvish (inflamed elbow) won't travel with the team to Miami on Monday, and will continue treatment in Arlington.	UP NEXT	The teams' three-game series concludes on Sunday. Angels LHP Hector Santiago (3-7, 5.84) defeated the Rangers 15-6 on July 10 in Arlington. Texas RHP Nick Tepesch (4-7, 4.29) last faced the Angels on July 11, when he lost 3-0.	SLUMPING	Rangers 1B J.P. Arencibia had been 0-for-19 before his run-scoring single in the fourth. RF Alex Rios was 0-for-16 before his two-run single in the seventh. LF Jim Adduci went 0-for-4, and is in an 0-for-20 slide. Angels CF Mike Trout went 0 for 5, extending his skid to 0 for 15.	HOT HOT HOT	Calhoun stretched his hitting streak to a season-high seven games. In six of those games, he has had multiple hits. He is batting .441 (15-for-34) during the streak. Calhoun has five RBIs in the series' first two games.	Texas CF Leonys Martin is 10-for-20 (.500) in his last five games, including two singles on Saturday.	SUPERLATIVES	Lewis struck out 10 batters for the first time since June 17, 2012. The 10-year veteran's career high is 12, posted May 10, 2012.	Kendrick's home run was his ninth in Arlington -- the most he has hit in any road ballpark.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

LOS ANGELES -- On a night when Clayton Kershaw couldn't keep the ball in the ballpark, Milwaukee's Yovani Gallardo held the Los Angeles Dodgers in check and sent the major leagues' ERA leader to his first loss in over 2 1/2 months.	Gallardo pitched eight strong innings, Ryan Braun and Carlos Gomez homered, and the Brewers ended Kershaw's streak of 11 straight victories with a 3-2 win over the Dodgers on Saturday night.	Gallardo (8-6), who threw 96 pitches, allowed a run and six hits with three strikeouts and a walk. The right-hander has won back-to-back starts for the first time since his first two outings of the season.	"Yo was just outstanding," Brewers manager Ron Roenicke said. "He had great command and an outstanding fastball. He pitched off the fastball the whole game, mixing in his slider and curveball. He really dominated. That's a good club, so you can't mess around and make mistakes against them."	Francisco Rodriguez got three outs for his major league-leading 38th save and 342nd of his career, despite giving up a leadoff homer to Matt Kemp in the ninth.	Rodriguez, who broke a tie with Hall of Famer and former Brewers closer Rollie Fingers for 11th place on baseball's career list, has passed 11 players this season.	Kershaw (14-3) pitched his 17th complete game in 202 career starts. He allowed five hits and no walks while striking out 11.	The two-time Cy Young Award winner and three-time defending major league ERA champ had a 1.16 ERA over his previous 13 starts since his last loss on May 28 against Cincinnati.	"It comes down to (the fact that) I got outpitched," Kershaw said. "Yovani pitched better than I did and we lost the game. I just made more mistakes than he did and it showed up on the scoreboard.	"It's funny, I felt like I pitched so much better than I did in Milwaukee. I got lucky in Milwaukee, and I'm paying for it here."	Last Sunday, Kershaw held the NL Central-leading Brewers to one run in eight innings in a 5-1 victory.	"He's the best pitcher in baseball and he's been on an incredibly great run," Braun said. "It's extremely difficult to beat him, and it hasn't happened much this year. So for us to do that is an impressive accomplishment and something we're proud of.	"To split those two games he started is encouraging for us."	Justin Turner had an RBI single in the fourth for the Dodgers, whose third loss in four games reduced their NL West lead over San Francisco to 4 1-2 games following the Giants' 6-5 win over Philadelphia.	Braun heard taunts of "Cheat-er, cheat-er" from the crowd of 50,849 as he dug in against Kershaw in the fourth inning. He temporarily silenced them with an opposite-field drive that barely cleared the right field fence and the leaping attempt of Kemp -- who was runner-up to Braun for NL MVP honors in 2011.	The two-run homer was the 15th shot this season for Braun, who was suspended for the final 65 games last season and the playoffs for violating baseball's drug policy.	Gomez drove Kershaw's first pitch of the sixth inning into the Dodgers bullpen in left field for his 19th homer.	"I think one of our biggest strengths is that we have guys up and down the lineup who have the ability to hit home runs and drive the ball for extra-base hits," Braun said. "When you face pitching that's this good, sometimes you don't get many opportunities."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: RHP Matt Garza, sidelined because of a strained left oblique, played catch for the second straight day.	Dodgers: 3B Juan Uribe was placed on the disabled list because of an injured right hamstring for the second time this season. He is the seventh Dodgers player to go on the DL this month, joining SS Hanley Ramirez and pitchers Josh Beckett, Hyun-Jin Ryu, Paul Maholm, Chris Perez and Paco Rodriguez.	UP NEXT	Brewers: Wily Peralta (14-7, 3.46 ERA) is 5-1 with a 2.06 ERA in his last six starts since giving up a career-worst nine runs in a 9-7 home loss to the Phillies.	Dodgers: Dan Haren (10-9, 4.50) is coming off victories over the Angels and Braves. He will attempt to win three consecutive starts for the first time since last July 27-Aug. 9, when he beat the Mets, Brewers and Phillies and went seven innings each time.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

CLEVELAND -- For much of the weekend, Baltimore didn't look like a division leader or contender.	They were ordinary Orioles.	One inning salvaged them.	Rookie Kevin Gausman pitched six strong innings and the Orioles, getting clutch two-out hits from J.J. Hardy and Chris Davis in the sixth, avoided being swept for the first time since May by beating the Cleveland Indians 4-1 on Sunday.	Gausman (7-4) allowed just one run and two hits as the AL East-leading Orioles got back in the win column after scoring just one run in their previous two games.	"It's been a rough couple of days, but those things are going to happen," said Steve Pearce, who had a leadoff double in the sixth and then homered in the seventh. "It was only a matter of time. We put together some good at-bats and grinded it out."	Hardy delivered a two-out RBI single and the slumping Davis added an RBI double to rally the Orioles, who were blanked over the first five by Danny Salazar (4-7).	Orioles reliever Darren O'Day pitched a perfect seventh, Andrew Miller struck out the side in the eighth and Zach Britton finished the two-hitter for his 26th save.	Jonathan Schoop also homered for Baltimore, which is an MLB-best 28-13 since June 30. However, the Orioles were listless for 25 innings, scoring once Friday, not at all Saturday and they trailed 1-0 before taking their first lead of the series in the sixth -- thanks to Hardy and Davis.	Salazar, recalled before the game from Triple-A Columbus, held Baltimore without a run on four hits through five before running into trouble in the sixth. He gave up Pearce's double and hit Adam Jones before he was replaced by Scott Atchison, who got two quick outs.	Hardy, though, came through with his single and Davis, who was dropped again in the order by manager Buck Showalter, looped a soft double into left to make it 2-1.	Gausman then set down the Indians in order in the sixth before turning it over to Baltimore's bullpen.	The right-hander, who improved to 3-1 on the road, sensed the Orioles' urgency to leave town with a victory.	"I definitely knew we needed a win," Gausman said. "We hadn't played very good baseball the last two days. When you get walked-off [Friday's 2-1 loss] and then you get beat the next day, it's huge when you get that last game."	The Indians failed to take advantage of another strong start.	Pearce homered off C.C. Lee in the seventh and Schoop's leadoff drive in the ninth made it 4-1.	Although he took the loss, Salazar continued a torrid run of starting pitching for the Indians, who got a typically strong outing from Corey Kluber in the opener before Carlos Carrasco blanked the Orioles on three hits over seven innings.	Over the past seven games, Cleveland's starters have posted a 1.02 ERA -- five earned runs in 44 innings.	As much as he wanted the sweep, Indians manager Terry Francona was satisfied with taking two of three from the free-swinging Orioles.	"You hope they get out of town and beat up on somebody else because they were pretty quiet for two games and a half of another," he said. "But there's a lot of thunder in that lineup."	LINEUP SHUFFLE	Davis began the series batting second, dropped to fifth Saturday and hit seventh in the finale. He snapped an 0-for-11 skid with a double in the third. It was his first game with two doubles since May 10, 2013.	WINDY CITY	The Orioles will spend the next week in Chicago. After playing three against the White Sox, they'll have an off day before opening a weekend series at Wrigley Field against the Cubs.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: 3B Manny Machado (sprained right knee) continues his rehab program, but he's not doing any baseball activities. There's no timetable for his return.	UP NEXT	Orioles: RHP Bud Norris (10-7) will start the series opener against the White Sox and Chris Sale (10-2) as the Orioles continue their nine-game road trip.	Indians: After an off day, the Indians will open a three-game set in Minnesota with Trevor Bauer (4-7) facing Twins RHP Kyle Gibson (11-9).	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DETROIT -- Lloyd McClendon was upset after he was thrown out by umpire Tony Randazzo for the second straight game. At least this time it came in a victory for his Seattle Mariners.	Chris Young pitched six shutout innings and Seattle beat Detroit 8-1 Sunday, winning the weekend series and moving back ahead of the Tigers in the race for the second AL wild-card spot.	McClendon was ejected in the seventh inning of the series finale when Randazzo said the manager made a hand gesture after the third base umpire turned down a check-swing appeal on a 3-2 pitch to Alex Avila.	"They said I raised my hand," McClendon said. "That's a new one for me."	Randazzo said McClendon "took his hand and shooed away my call."	McClendon also was ejected by Randazzo during Detroit's 4-2 win on Saturday night for arguing balls and strikes, even though McClendon said it wasn't him complaining.	"I've never had a problem with him before this weekend, so I don't understand this," McClendon said. "If there's a history between us, I'm certainly not aware of it."	Young (12-6) allowed four hits and walked one while improving to 2-0 with a 1.67 ERA in four career starts against Detroit. The 6-foot-10 right-hander has won each of his last three starts this season and is 4-0 with a 2.45 ERA in his last five games overall.	"With that lineup, you know you are going to get into trouble," he said. "The key is getting out of it, and I was able to miss bats when I needed to today."	Tigers rookie Robbie Ray (1-3) struggled while replacing injured right-hander Anibal Sanchez. Ray allowed four runs, three earned, and seven hits in five innings.	"We're asking Robbie to compete in a pennant race," Detroit manager Brad Ausmus said. "That's a tall order. It's not always going to come up roses for a young pitcher in that situation."	Ray got into trouble in the first inning, when he hurt himself by a balk when he lost focus in mid-delivery and stumbled off the mound without throwing a pitch. He also threw a wild pitch in the third that allowed a run to score, giving Seattle a 3-0 lead.	Rajai Davis created a threat for Detroit with one out in the bottom half, walking and stealing second and third, but Young got out of the jam.	Chris Denorfia's two-out RBI triple made it 4-0 in the fifth, and the Mariners added three more in the sixth in Jim Johnson's first appearance with Detroit.	Victor Martinez drove in Detroit's only run with an eighth-inning double.	UP NEXT	Seattle: The Mariners travel to Philadelphia to open a three-game series with the Phillies on Monday night. Roenis Elias (9-9, 4.14 ERA) is scheduled to start in the opener for Seattle, while Jerome Williams (0-0, 3.38 ERA) will go for Philadelphia.	Detroit: The Tigers have Monday off before going to Tampa for three games. Detroit's Max Scherzer (14-4, 2.98 ERA) is scheduled to oppose Chris Archer (8-6, 3.24 ERA) in the opener, while David Price is slated to go against his old team on Thursday.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Seattle: OF Michael Saunders will get a few more rehab games with Triple-A Tacoma before rejoining the Mariners.	Detroit: RHP Joakim Soria (oblique) was feeling "significantly better" on Saturday, according to Ausmus. Soria is eligible to return from the disabled list on Aug. 25, and will probably make a rehab appearance before that. . Davis left the game with a left thumb contusion.	Umpires: Randazzo was hit in the left foot by a line drive from Detroit's J.D. Martinez in the fourth inning, but the ball only struck a glancing blow and he stayed in the game.	LETTING DOWN	Ausmus thought the Tigers might have lost some focus after beating Felix Hernandez on Saturday. "Young pitched well, but that wasn't all Chris Young," he said. "After the adrenaline high facing a guy like King Felix, we had a few good at-bats today, but we need to have better ones up and down the lineup."	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

NEW YORK --  Starlin Castro gave Mets fans a firsthand tease of the two-way talent that has so many of them eager to see him in a New York uniform.	The All-Star shortstop hit a tiebreaking homer on the first pitch of the ninth inning Sunday, lifting the Chicago Cubs to a 2-1 victory at Citi Field. Castro also started a slick double play to snuff out a rally, showing off the full set of skills that could make him an attractive trade target this winter.	Chicago has several touted shortstops rising through its system, while the Mets are searching for a solution at that position. So it seems a possible fit, and plenty of Mets backers have called for the team to pursue the 24-year-old Castro.	"He's having a very good season and we're glad to see that," Cubs manager Rick Renteria said.	Chicago starter Jake Arrieta allowed two hits in seven smooth innings. Featuring a sharp curve, he struck out nine and left with a 1-0 lead following Luis Valbuena's run-scoring single in the fourth.	"I just had a good feel for it. Was able to throw it in multiple counts, for a strike, below the zone," Arrieta said. "So it was there for me when I needed it today."	Curtis Granderson tied it with a two-out RBI single off winner Pedro Strop (2-4) in the eighth, snapping skids of 0 for 17 and 1 for 29. A diving catch by rookie center fielder Arismendy Alcantara moments earlier prevented more potential damage.	Castro greeted closer Jenrry Mejia (5-6) with his 13th home run, an opposite-field drive that barely cleared the wall near the right-field corner.	"Just go up there and be aggressive," Castro said. "We've played a lot of extra-inning games the last 20, 15 games, whatever."	Hector Rondon got three quick outs for his 17th save, finishing a four-hitter that ended Chicago's three-game losing streak.	Valbuena returned to the lineup and snapped a 1-for-32 slide with a two-out RBI single off Mets rookie Rafael Montero, still looking for his first win after six major league starts. Montero delivered an encouraging performance, though, going 7 1/3 innings for the longest outing of his career.	Arrieta struck out three straight in the second and whiffed the 3-4-5 hitters in the fourth. He started a 1-6-3 double play after a leadoff walk in the seventh and was helped out of his toughest jam by Castro in the third.	With runners at the corners, the shortstop made a sharp pickup and a nifty flip to start an inning-ending double play against Juan Lagares. Rookie second baseman Javier Baez got in on the act with a barehanded turn.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: Prized 3B prospect Kris Bryant, who left Saturday's game with Triple-A Iowa, is day to day with a bruised left foot, the result of a foul ball a few days ago. "All indications are he's OK," Renteria said. Bryant has 40 homers combined at Double-A and Triple-A this season, most in professional baseball, and 103 RBIs. He is not on the 40-man roster, however, and the Cubs are not planning to promote him to the majors this season, even when rosters expand in September.	Mets: As expected, 3B David Wright was out of the lineup with a sore left shoulder. Wright left Saturday's game one inning after he was hit by a fastball in the back of the shoulder, aggravating an area that's bothered him all summer. Eric Campbell started at third and went 0 for 4 with three strikeouts and a double-play grounder.	UP NEXT	Cubs rookie Kyle Hendricks (4-1, 1.73 ERA) starts the four-game series finale Monday afternoon against 41-year-old Bartolo Colon (11-10, 3.85), who is 0-2 with a 4.73 ERA in five career starts against Chicago. Valbuena has two homers in five at-bats against Colon.	WELCOME TO THE SHOW	Chicago outfielder Matt Szczur, just called up from Triple-A Iowa, made his major league debut as a pinch runner in the eighth. He stayed in the game in right field and grounded into a fielder's choice one inning later.	Szczur said he had around 18 people in his cheering section. He is from Cape May, New Jersey, about 3 hours from Citi Field. Renteria said he expects to give Szczur a start at some point.	WALK THIS WAY	Baez scored after a leadoff walk in the fourth, his first in 55 major league plate appearances. He walked again in the eighth.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MIAMI --  The numbers are adding up for Giancarlo Stanton. So are the wins for the Miami Marlins.	Stanton hit his major league-leading 32nd homer and drove in four runs Sunday, powering the Marlins past the Arizona Diamondbacks 10-3.	Stanton has a career-high 88 RBIs, one more than he had in 2011. He went 7 for 14 with four walks and six RBIs in the four-game series against Arizona.	"I think ultimately his numbers are going to speak for him when you talk about what he means to our ballclub and the intimidation factor that he brings to other ballclubs," Marlins manager Mike Redmond said. "This guy just continues to get big hits."	The Marlins have won five of seven and evened their record at 62-62, equaling their victory total from all of last year.	"It's different coming to the field, it's not a morgue in here every time you walk in and the black drapes and everything is drooping," Stanton said.	Garrett Jones also homered for the Marlins. Marcell Ozuna and Jarrod Saltalamacchia each drove in two runs and Christian Yelich had three hits.	Stanton hit a three-run home run in the first inning, surpassing Hanley Ramirez for second place on the club's all-time list with 149 career homers. He also boosted his RBI total with a single in the seventh.	"That's good for me, I haven't broke 100 yet here," Stanton said. "It's helping us win, that's more than any single accolade that I can have."	Tom Koehler (9-9) pitched six innings, allowing two runs.	Stanton hit a three-run homer and Jones also connected in the first against Josh Collmenter (8-7).	"I don't how many times (Stanton) has hit a homer for me in the first inning, but I love it," Koehler said.	Arizona's Ender Inciarte extended his hitting streak to 17 games with a bunt single in the sixth.	"It was a bad thing that we couldn't keep them close," Inciarte said. "We've got to be able to give ourselves a chance to in the game."	Mark Trumbo and Jake Lamb hit RBI singles in the sixth that pulled Arizona within 5-2.	The Marlins broke open the game by scoring five times in the seventh. Stanton hit an RBI single, Ozuna had a two-run double and Saltalamacchia singled home two runs. Diamondbacks reliever Randall Delgado was charged with five runs and got just one batter out.	"You get down five runs and you chip away," Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson said. "We got two back and were at least in the picture there, but you have to hold them and we were unable to do that."	This was Miami's highest-scoring game since an 11-6 win at Tampa Bay on June 5.	"We've all been waiting for one of those and give ourselves a real cushion so we don't have to pitch so perfect," Redmond said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: RHP Daniel Hudson (Tommy John surgery) threw one scoreless inning on Saturday night in the Arizona League, allowing one hit and striking out one.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: Arizona travels to Washington for a four-game series beginning on Monday night. LHP Vidal Nuno (0-3, 3.92) starts against Nationals RHP Jordan Zimmermann (8-5, 2.92).	Marlins: Off Monday, Miami will start RHP Jarred Cosart (1-1, 2.92) at home Tuesday night against Texas RHP Miles Mikolas (1-5, 7.71) to begin a two-game set.	FAST START	Stanton has hit 11 of his 32 home runs this season in the first inning, which is the second-highest total of first-inning homers in a season by a Marlins player. Gary Sheffield hit 14 in 1996.	STREAKING	Inciarte's hitting string is the longest active streak in the majors and the longest ever by a Diamondbacks rookie. He is hitting .320 (24 for 75) during that stretch.	"He's a smart player and he utilizes his tools very well," Gibson said. "He plays hard."	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BOSTON --  For a few seconds it looked like the inning was over. Then, a couple of minutes later, Jose Altuve's grand slam broke the game open.	Altuve hit his first slam after Boston shortstop Xander Bogaerts made a mental gaffe on a play that would have ended an inning Sunday, carrying the Houston Astros to an 8-1 victory over the Red Sox.	Leading 2-0, the Astros got a break when manager Bo Porter won a challenge and they scored four runs after Bogaerts' mistake. The shortstop picked up Marwin Gonzalez's grounder, ran to second for what looked like a force and fired to first. The problem was he threw the ball about a step before he tagged the bag. After Joe Kelly walked the bases full, Altuve homered into the Green Monster seats.	"That there's a big play," said Porter, who said he was first told by the umpires that the play wasn't reviewable. "You look at that stage of the game and what proceeded to happen after that, Altuve with the big grand slam, one could say that was the biggest play of the game."	Red Sox manager John Farrell was ejected by first-base umpire Doug Eddings after Altuve's slam when he came out to argue.	"My initial explanation on the field was that it was a neighborhood play," Farrell said. "My interpretation is that neighborhood play should not be determined by a feed throw or not, a neighborhood play is not a reviewable play."	Crew chief Jim Joyce, speaking to a pool reporter from the AP, said because he had never seen the play before that the crew decided to ask the replay center for help.	"Actually, we have not have had that play per say where the shortstop or the second baseman go right to the bag on their own," he said. "So, just to make everything clear, I explained to Bo that I was going to ask New York, the replay center, if it was in fact reviewable because a neighborhood play is not. New York came back to me and said, `Yes, that play is reviewable' and I came back to them and said, `OK, Houston is challenging that play' and that was the outcome."	Altuve, who leads the majors in hits, went 4 for 5, raising his hit total to 173 and majors' best average to .339 as the Astros completed a split of the four-game series.	Dexter Fowler and Jon Singleton added solo homers for Houston, which earned its 52nd win to surpass last year's total.	Daniel Nava had an RBI double for Boston.	Collin McHugh (6-9) gave up one run on seven hits in six innings for Houston.	Kelly (0-1) was tagged for seven runs on seven hits, walking six over four innings in his Fenway Park debut with the Red Sox. He was acquired at the non-waiver trade deadline along with first baseman/outfielder Allen Craig for right-hander John Lackey.	Fowler's homer in the third made it 7-0.	WHAT A DAY	Altuve became the first Astros' player to collect four hits and a slam in the same game since Jeff Bagwell did it on April 9, 2004 at Milwaukee. He also matched his career high with the hits for the seventh time, last came on June 27 against Detroit.	HOMER HAPPY	The Astros entered the day second in the majors with 50 homers since July 1. They have 16 games this season with three or more homers and have gone 14-2.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros 1B Jesus Guzman, on the DL since August 2 with back spasms and on a rehab assignment with Triple-A Oklahoma City, is eligible to come off.	Red Sox 2B Dustin Pedroia was out sick and it was his 31st birthday. He had three homers in seven previous games on his birthday.	UP NEXT	The Astros are off Monday before opening a three-game series at Yankee Stadium Tuesday when LHP Brett Oberholtzer (4-8, 3.87 ERA) is scheduled to face New York's lefty Chris Capuano (1-3, 4.13).	RHP Brandon Workman (1-6, 4.45 ERA) is slated to go for Boston Monday, facing C. J. Wilson (9-8, 4.71 ERA) when the Red Sox open a three-game series against the Los Angeles Angels.	CELEBRITY SIGHTING	Actor Matthew McConaughey watched the game from the second row down the left-field line just past the Astros' dugout. He appeared to go fairly unnoticed until he left in the top of the ninth and many fans took pictures and shook hands as he was walking out.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Hiroki Kuroda got a couple extra days between starts and it looked as if it paid off.	Kuroda pitched neatly into the seventh inning, Brett Gardner drove in two runs and the New York Yankees beat the Tampa Bay Rays 4-2 on Sunday.	Kuroda (8-8) retired 17 straight batters after allowing consecutive one-out singles to Ben Zobrist and Matt Joyce in the first.	"I was able to physically get refreshed as well as mentally," Kuroda said through a translator.	Kuroda gave up two runs and four hits in 6 2/3 innings. After Shawn Kelley and Dellin Betances combined for 1 1/3 scoreless innings, David Robertson closed for his 33rd save.	"He had everything in his arsenal today," New York manager Joe Girardi said of Kuroda, who lasted just 4 2/3 innings in his previous start.	New York has won two in a row after losing five straight.	"We won our last two, and hopefully go home and win five or six and keep on going," Gardner said.	Jeremy Hellickson (1-2) didn't allow a hit until there were two outs in the fifth.	After a walk to Stephen Drew, Martin Prado doubled and Gardner followed with a two-run single. Jacoby Ellsbury, hitless in his previous 17 at-bats during a five-game road trip, made it 3-1 with an RBI single on New York's fourth straight hit.	"The walk to Drew really set the game the other way," Rays manager Joe Maddon said.	Hellickson made his sixth start after right elbow surgery in January. He left after the fifth.	Mark Teixeira reached 20 homers for the 11th time in his career with a solo shot in the Yankees eighth. The slugger tied Joe DiMaggio for 80th place on the all-time list with 361.	Evan Longoria had two RBIs for the Rays. He hit a run-scoring grounder in the first and drove in Joyce with a seventh-inning single that pulled Tampa Bay within 3-2.	Prado also made several strong defensive plays at second base during Kuroda's long run of consecutive outs.	Tampa Bay had its club record of holding opponents to three runs or less end at 12 consecutive games. The Rays were just 7-5 over the stretch.	"That's like mid-'60s baseball," Maddon said. "We'd like to take a little more advantage than 7-5."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: Derek Jeter was the DH for the second straight game and sixth time this season. Jeter fouled a ball off his lower left leg Saturday, but Girardi said giving Jeter a break from the turf at Tropicana Field was behind the decision. ... C Brian McCann was hitless in four at-bats in his return after missing six games with a concussion.	Rays: RF Wil Myers (broken right wrist) could return this week. OF David DeJesus (broken left hand) will not play in a rehab game Monday due to hand soreness.	KURODA'S HOMEWORK	Joyce is 9 for 23 with three homers off Kuroda, which is something the right-hander has taken notice of.	"If I knew what causes it, I'm sure I'd be able to get him out," Kuroda said. "That's something that I have to take home and study."	UP NEXT	Yankees: LHP Chris Capuano (1-3) is scheduled to start against Houston LHP Brett Oberholtzer (4-8) Tuesday night.	Rays: Tampa Bay and Detroit begin a three-game series Tuesday night at Tropicana Field. Former Rays ace David Price is scheduled to face Tampa Bay for the first time Thursday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

CHICAGO --  Conor Gillaspie leads the Chicago White Sox with a .311 batting average, and on Sunday the third baseman led them to a win with a rare burst of power.	Gillaspie hit his first grand slam and Jordan Danks added a two-run shot to cap a six-run first inning, and the White Sox held on to beat the Toronto Blue Jays 7-5.	Gillaspie connected for just his fifth homer and Danks hit his second off Toronto's Drew Hutchison (8-11), who lost for the fifth time in seven decisions.	Danks nailed a 2-2 pitch off the 23-year-old Blue Jays right-hander, who pitched seven innings and limited the White Sox to one run after the first.	"It was just through the hands with two strikes and put it in play hard," Gillaspie said. "You know sometimes you get them up in the air, sometimes you miss them.	"It was definitely a good jump-start to the game."	Manager Robin Ventura wasn't surprised by Gillaspie deep drive to right-center field.	"It's not like you wouldn't expect him to hit home runs, but he's just a line drive hitter," Ventura said.  "When he hits it good, it's going to go."	Chicago right-hander Scott Carroll (5-7) went 5 2/3 innings and allowed five runs on eight hits and three walks.	Toronto's Edwin Encarnacion hit a two-run homer, his 27th this season and first since returning from the disabled list on Friday. The Blue Jays have lost five of six and 11 of 15 to fall 7 1/2 games behind Baltimore in the AL East and four behind Seattle in the AL wild card race.	Hutchison has given up six runs or more in four of his last seven starts.	"I had two outs, and I had two strikes," Hutchison said of the Gillaspie's at-bat. "I had a good chance to get through the inning with no runs and I gave up six, and put us in a big hole."	Danks added a third RBI on a sac fly in the sixth. Jake Petricka earned his ninth save in 12 chances after loading the bases in the ninth.	"It wasn't like we didn't have any shots," Toronto manager John Gibbons said. "We just couldn't get that big hit."	Encarnacion golfed his homer just into the left field bullpen in the fifth as Toronto cut it to 6-4. Pinch-hitter Dioner Navarro singled in a run in the sixth to make it 6-5.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Toronto: RHP Kyle Drabek, 7-7 with a 4.00 ERA in Triple-A Buffalo, rejoined the Blue Jays bullpen on Sunday. Drabek is 8-15 in stints over four previous seasons with Toronto, both as a starter and reliever. He last pitched for the Blue Jays on Sept. 25, 2013.	Veteran 1B Dan Johnson began a rehab assignment with Triple-A Buffalo on Saturday, going 0 for 3 with an RBI. He's played 13 games with the Blues Jays this season and was put on the DL with a strained left hamstring.	TOP PRIZE	White Sox: LHP Carlos Rodon, the third overall pick in this year's MLB draft and one of Chicago's top prospects, is scheduled make his Triple-A debut with Charlotte on Tuesday.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays: LHP J.A. Happ (8-7, 4.20) faces Brewers RHP Mike Fiers (2-1, 1.29) at Milwaukee on Tuesday. Fiers had a career-high 14 strikeouts in his last start, his second since his recall from the minors.	White Sox: LHP Chris Sale (10-2, 2.01) will face Baltimore RHP Bud Norris (10-7, 3.75) in Chicago on Monday to start a three-game series. Following an off-day on Thursday, Baltimore has a three-game set against the Cubs at Wrigley Field	SETTING AVI-SAIL	Although the White Sox are out of contention, the return of speedy, 23-year-old Avisail Garcia will give them a boost. The 6-foot-4, 240-pound Venezuelan, acquired last season from Detroit as part of a three-way deal involving Boston, also has the power to fit in the middle of the lineup.	His next steps: Consistency and playing a full major league season, according to manager Robin Ventura. "There's a lot of learning curve that he'll have," Ventura said. "I think it's similar to what Jose's (Abreu) gone through this season."	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MINNEAPOLIS -- The Kansas City Royals scored seven runs in the second inning. Then they really started hitting the ball.	Alex Gordon, Salvador Perez and Josh Willingham homered, and the Royals beat the Minnesota Twins 12-6 on Sunday for their 20th win in their last 25 games.	Kansas City sent 11 batters to the plate in the big second, keyed by two-run singles for Alcides Escobar and Nori Aoki. The Royals then started hitting the ball out of the park after a 54-minute rain delay in the fourth.	Gordon sent one drive into a flower bed in right-center. Perez lined one into the left-field seats, and Willingham's homer traveled an estimated 433 feet into the third deck in left field.	"Those tack on runs are huge," Royals manager Ned Yost said.	The Royals also increased their AL Central lead to 1 1/2 games over Detroit, which lost 8-1 to Seattle. This is the latest the Royals have been in first place since 2003.	Kansas City's Jeremy Guthrie (9-10) returned to the mound after the delay in the fourth and lasted seven innings, yielding home runs by Joe Mauer and Kennys Vargas.	Oswaldo Arcia also went deep for Minnesota, hitting a two-run drive off Jason Frasor in the eighth for his 11th homer.	But Kansas City's post-rain delay power surge helped it remain in control despite the Twins showing some power of their own.	"You gotta fight for 27 outs," Perez said. "We continued to play hard. We needed to keep hitting it until the game was over."	In his second start with Minnesota since coming over in a trade from Oakland, Tommy Milone (6-4) allowed seven runs in a career-low 1 1/3 innings.	"Awful. The first inning was good, the second one was pretty awful," Milone said. "Couldn't get a good feel, try not to walk guys, left the ball over the plate. It was pretty tough."	The first pitch was delayed 34 minutes in anticipation of a rain shower that never happened. The rain did arrive as the second inning started and got worse until umpires called the players off the field with one out in the bottom of the fourth.	After managing just one run in Saturday night's 4-1 loss, the Royals scored 10 or more for just the third time since June 17.	"With the weather and everything, we were pretty good," Perez said. "We fought through it."	GUTHRIE COMES BACK OUT	Guthrie helped save a tired Royals bullpen by staying in the game after the rain delay. "Just to be able to maneuver through that made it a good day for us," Yost said.	NO EXCUSES	Twins manager Ron Gardenhire wasn't going to blame the weather for Milone's bad second inning. "They played through the same thing," Gardenhire said. "They got it done, we didn't."	NO-RAIN RAIN DELAY	It wasn't the first time this season the Twins have had a game delayed by rain that never arrived. The first pitch for Minnesota's 5-4 loss to Houston at Target Field on June 6 was pushed back 81 minutes even though not a drop fell from the sky.	TRAINER'S ROOM	ROYALS: Setup man Wade Davis and closer Greg Holland were available on Sunday, a day after manager Ned Yost gave each reliever a day off.	UP NEXT	ROYALS: Coming off his sixth career shutout vs. Oakland, Jason Vargas (9-5) starts the finale of the four-game series on Monday. Vargas has a 0.86 ERA in three starts against Minnesota this year and hasn't allowed a run in the last two.	TWINS: Trevor May (0-1) will try and bounce back after walking seven batters over two innings during his first major league start on Aug. 9. "He's been like a raging bull out there," Gardenhire said. "We gotta calm him down right now."	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ST. LOUIS --  The St. Louis Cardinals got just enough hitting to save Trevor Rosenthal.	Matt Carpenter homered, doubled and drove in three runs and Adam Wainwright tied for the major league lead with his 15th win in a 7-6 victory over the San Diego Padres 7-6 on Sunday.	"Our offense did a great job, put us all on their back," Wainwright said.	The 24-year-old Rosenthal is among the major league leaders with 36 saves in 40 chances in his first season as closer. He walked the bases full with a strikeout in the ninth and Seth Maness gave up a two-run single to Abraham Almonte before earning his second save in two chances.	"We needed to get him some help," manager Mike Matheny said. "We didn't feel like we were going to sit around and watch too much without giving him a break."	Three walks was a career worst for Rosenthal, who has walked five his last two appearances along with three hits and three runs in 1 1/3 innings. The hard-throwing righty and his manager believe it's a timing issue and not about fatigue.	"Physically, everything feels pretty good," Rosenthal said. "I think it's just going to be narrowing the sights a little bit, or maybe not trying to do too much."	Rosenthal is among the league leaders with 57 appearances.	"We've worked him pretty hard and we're going to be very careful about how we move forward," Matheny said. "We're not afraid to use the other guys in our bullpen to pick up the games when he can't.	"But as far as his role, he's our closer."	Jon Jay's two-run single highlighted a four-run first inning when the Cardinals batted around against rookie Odrisamer Despaigne (3-4). Peter Bourjos and Tony Cruz each had an RBI single for St. Louis, which took three of four in the series.	Despaigne needed 37 pitches to get out of the first.	"He just couldn't finish off any hitters," manager Bud Black said. "He couldn't get any of his pitches where he needed to get them."	Carpenter's two-run double off Tim Stauffer in the sixth made it a three-run cushion for Wainwright (15-7), who joined the Reds' Johnny Cueto at 15 wins. Milwaukee's Wily Peralta was seeking his 15th later Sunday.	Wainwright allowed three earned runs in seven innings with five strikeouts and one walk, overcoming a handful of rough patches. He hasn't felt locked in for a while.	"It's been a grind for over a month now," Wainwright said. "I'm about ready for it to end."	Wainwright is 5-0 at home with a 1.55 ERA against the Padres, so this was one of his stiffer tests.	"We did a nice job of laying off the breaking balls as the game went on," Black said. "We put together some better swings."	Alexi Amarista and Yangvertis Solarte had an RBI apiece in the San Diego fifth. Jake Goebbert had an RBI triple and scored on second baseman Kolten Wong's wild relay as the Padres pulled within 5-4 in the sixth.	First baseman Matt Adams made a nice defensive stop to rob Seth Smith of a game-tying hit for the second out in the ninth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: 3B Solarte has started the last two games after missing a pair with a mild left oblique strain.	Cardinals: OF Matt Holliday got a day off with a minor knee problem, plus has been scuffling at the plate, going 0 for 18 the previous five games.	UP NEXT	Padres: Ian Kennedy (9-10, 3.54) and San Diego open a three-game set against the Dodgers' Kevin Correia (1-0, 1.50).	Cardinals: Justin Masterson (6-7, 5.58) faces the Reds and Mike Leake (9-11, 3.59) on Monday. Masterson is coming off seven scoreless innings against the Marlins, the best of three starts since arriving at the trade deadline.	STRONG STROKE	Jay is 12 for 24 during a nine-game hitting streak and is batting .417 this month. Jay also was hit by a pitch four times in a span of five plate appearances on Friday and Saturday.	"He's doing a nice job of getting on base, whether he's a magnet or not," Matheny said.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- Adam Rosales got the pitch he was expecting from Los Angeles Angels closer Huston Street on Sunday.	The Texas utilityman hit that pitch over drawn-in left fielder Collin Cowgill for an RBI single, capping a two-run rally in the ninth inning that lifted the Rangers over the Angels 3-2.	"His scouting report is that he throws 60 to 70 percent sliders, so you're looking to hit that pitch," Rosales said. "Once you see the ball drop, you get that release of joy. It's a happy feeling."	Texas had lost four in a row overall, and nine straight to the Angels. Los Angeles had won its past four games.	Rosales drove in the winning run for the second time in six days -- the only games Texas won on a seven-game homestand.	His single was the Rangers' fourth straight hit off Street to begin the ninth. Alex Rios and Adrian Beltre opened with singles, setting up RBI singles by Mike Carp and Rosales.	Rosales ended a 5-4 victory over Tampa Bay on Tuesday with a bases-loaded walk in the 14th.	Street (1-1) had saved the first two games of the three-game series. The blown save was his second in 35 opportunities with the Angels and Padres.	Street had not given up a run since being acquired from San Diego on July 18 until Carp's tying single.	"I didn't make very good pitches today," Street said. "That's the bottom line. I felt fine."	Neftali Feliz (1-1) pitched a scoreless ninth inning.	Cowgill's bases-loaded single and Kole Calhoun's RBI grounder drove in second-inning runs against Nick Tepesch.	"That second inning could have really got ugly in the past," Rangers manager Ron Washington said. "This was the new Nick Tepesch. It's starting to come together for him."	Tepesch went seven innings for the second straight start. Angels starter Hector Santiago pitched six innings, allowing a run and four hits.	Rosales singled, stole second base and scored on Rougned Odor's single in the fifth.	Tepesch left after a leadoff walk to Mike Trout in the eighth. The Angels loaded the bases with no outs, but didn't score.	"In the end," Washington said, "We were able to get their closer."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: LHP Joe Thatcher (sprained left ankle) will be eligible to come off the disabled list Monday, but might not return before September.	Rangers: OF Engel Beltre (fractured right tibia) started a rehab assignment in the Arizona Rookie League on Saturday, but left in the third inning because of general leg soreness.	UP NEXT	Angels: LHP C.J. Wilson (9-8, 4.71) is scheduled to start for Los Angeles on Monday night in Boston. He went 6⅔ innings to win his most recent start over the Phillies on Aug. 12.	Rangers: Texas is off Monday. RHP Miles Mikolas (1-5, 7.71) starts Tuesday night in the opener of a two-game road trip to Miami. He is from Jupiter, Florida.	COOLING OFF	The starting time temperature was 71 degrees, the coolest for an August game in Arlington since Aug. 7, 1997, when it was 71 for a game against the Yankees. By game's end Sunday, it was up to 83.	STOPPED	Calhoun's seven-game hitting streak, during which he batted .441, ended with him going 0-for-4. His RBI gave him six for the series.	TROUT'S HIT	Trout's hitless streak stretched to 18 at-bats before his fifth-inning single. He was 1-for-3 with a walk.	IN THE CLUTCH	Carp entered the game in the seventh to pinch hit for J.P. Arencibia and lined out. Staying in at 1B, Carp improved to 4-for-23 since he was cut by Boston and joined Texas. He has driven in a run each with three of his hits.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

Giants 5, Phillies 2. New approach. With AP Photos	By RICK EYMER	Associated Press	SAN FRANCISCO --  A little bit of patience has led to a lot of confidence for Michael Morse, who finished the three-game series with Philadelphia reaching base in nine straight plate appearances.	Morse got three hits and scored twice as the San Francisco Giants won consecutive home games for the first time in over two months, beating the Phillies 5-2 on Sunday.	"I'm just getting hits now. I'm not trying to do too much, just get a pitch to hit," Morse said. "I'm not seeing the ball any better, I'm being more patient."	Andrew Susac had two hits and drove in the go-ahead run for the Giants, who won their first series at home since taking two of three from Arizona right before the All-Star break. Brandon Crawford drove in a pair of runs.	Chase Utley and Cody Asche drove in runs for the Phillies, who have lost seven of their last nine.	Tim Lincecum (10-8) managed to work through five innings to end a personal three-game losing streak. He gave up two runs and seven hits, walking four and striking out two.	"I tried to do my best with what I had," Lincecum said. "I started doing what I wanted later but my pitch count got up there."	Lincecum needed 76 pitches to finish three innings and came out after throwing 97. The Phillies stranded eight runners over the first five innings, including the bases loaded in the third.	"We couldn't come up with the hit with runners on," Phillies manager Ryne Sandberg said. "He doesn't give up. He stayed with his changeup. He gets you fishing in those situations."	Javier Lopez, Jean Machi, Sergio Romo and Santiago Casilla combined for four scoreless innings, allowing two hits and striking out nine. Casilla earned his 10th save in 13 chances.	Not since June 8 had the Giants won two straight at AT&T Park.	David Buchanan (6-7) allowed two earned runs and nine hits in 6 2/3 innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: LHP Jesse Biddle, considered one of the team's top prospects, strained his right quad on Saturday in a start for Double-A Reading. . RHP Kyle Kendrick apologized to Sandberg for storming off the mound when he was removed from Saturday's game against the Giants. He said he was upset about coming out and not at teammates Chase Utley and Ryan Howard for allowing a pop fly to land safely.	Giants: Bryan Stow, the Giants fan who was the victim of a brutal beating at Dodger Stadium on opening day in 2011, was a surprise visitor to the San Francisco clubhouse before the game. Third base coach Tim Flannery ushered in Stow in his wheelchair. Stow's son, Tyler, accompanied him. Stow visited with nearly every player and left with several souvenirs. "I know all those players have to be excited to see him and have him here at the ballpark and the clubhouse," Bochy said. "With all he's been through, all his family's been through, it's great to have him here." ... INF Joe Panik suffered a dislocated finger on his left hand and had X-rays taken. He'll be re-evaluated when the team goes to Chicago . C Hector Sanchez (concussion) was a scratch from Friday's lineup at Triple-A Fresno with back spasms. He also left Saturday's game after getting hit in the mask by a foul tip. He's rejoined the team in San Francisco for further evaluation.	UP NEXT	Phillies: RHP Jerome Williams (2-5, 6.43) will make his second start since being claimed off waivers when he pitches Monday at home against Seattle. He allowed two earned runs in 5 1/3 innings against the Los Angeles Angels last Tuesday.	Giants: RHP Ryan Vogelsong (7-8, 3.71) gets the start Tuesday when the Giants open a road trip at the Chicago Cubs. He's 3-3 with a 6.19 ERA in nine career appearances at Wrigley Field, though he's currently on a three-game winning streak there.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

LOS ANGELES --  Jonathan Lucroy put the finishing touches on Milwaukee's resounding three-game sweep of Los Angeles, giving the NL West leaders plenty to think about should they meet again in October.	Lucroy tied a season high with five RBIs, including his first home run in more than three weeks, and the Brewers beat the Dodgers 7-2 on Sunday to maintain their three-game lead over St. Louis in the NL Central.	Lucroy also had five RBIs on June 17 at Arizona, including a pair of homers -- one of which was a grand slam.	"It was one of those days where I got a couple of good pitches to hit and was able to hit them hard," Lucroy said. "(Dan) Haren made a couple of mistakes up in the zone and I was able to take advantage."	Wily Peralta (15-7) tied Johnny Cueto and Adam Wainwright for the major league lead in victories, allowing five hits in six scoreless innings. The right-hander is 6-1 with a 1.79 ERA in seven starts since giving up a career-worst nine runs in a 9-7 home loss to Philadelphia on July 8.	"I've just been pounding the strike zone and working ahead of the hitters. That's been the difference since that game in Philadelphia," Peralta said. "I've been able to locate my fastball and mix it in with some off-speed stuff.	"They made me work today, but I was able to make the big pitch when I had to and I was able to put zeroes on the board. And it's always good when you get early run support."	Carlos Gomez hit his 20th homer, helping the Brewers become the first team to sweep the Dodgers in a series of three or more games this season. They also won a road series for the first time since sweeping a three-game set from Colorado from June 20-22.	The Dodgers' fourth loss in five games, coupled with San Francisco's 5-2 win over Philadelphia, reduced their NL West lead over the Giants to 3 1/2 games.	"We played a really good team and they showed why. They have a very deep lineup and good pitching," Haren said. "I mean, they're in first place, so it's not like we got swept by some last-place team."	Haren (10-10) gave up six runs and five hits over three innings in his shortest outing of the season, following consecutive victories against the Angels and Atlanta Braves.	Two of the runs on Haren's line were unearned, the result of an error by three-time Gold Glove first baseman Adrian Gonzalez, who dropped a short throw from second baseman Dee Gordon on a grounder by Jean Segura in the second.	Haren, who came in averaging 1.86 walks per nine innings, opened the game by walking Gomez and giving up Lucroy's 13th homer. He walked Gomez again with two out in the second, and Lucroy cleared the bases with his NL-leading 40th double to give the Brewers a 5-0 lead.	"I definitely was trying to pitch Gomez carefully, and he didn't swing at anything out of the zone," Haren said. "The scouting report said he's a free swinger and he doesn't walk too much. With a guy with the amount of power he has, you've got to be a little careful. And when he gets on first base, he's a threat to run. So you've always got to be conscious of that and be a little quicker to the plate to the next guy."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: 2B Scooter Gennett's troublesome right quad has curtailed his ability to run the bases at maximum efficiency -- as was the case in the third, when he was held at third on a double to right-center by Khris Davis for the second time in the series.	Dodgers: At this point, only hip surgery will end RHP Josh Beckett's season prematurely. "I have not heard anything about him getting shut down for the whole year," manager Don Mattingly said. "We're going to do everything to have him have the opportunity to pitch again this year. But I don't think we look at Josh as somebody who would come out of the bullpen for us."	UP NEXT	Brewers: Mike Fiers (2-1, 1.29 ERA) pitches Tuesday night's series opener against Toronto. Last Tuesday, he struck out 14 in a 6-2 win over the Cubs, ending a Brewers streak of 286 consecutive games without a double-digit strikeout performance.	Dodgers: Kevin Correia opens the three-game series against San Diego, his second start since he was acquired Aug. 9 from Minnesota and replaced Beckett in the rotation.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DENVER --  Drew Stubbs capped Colorado's five-run ninth inning with a three-run homer, sending the Rockies to a 10-9 victory over the Cincinnati Reds on Sunday in the first game of a doubleheader.	The Reds carried a 9-5 lead into the ninth, but All-Star closer Aroldis Chapman walked four straight batters before he was replaced by J.J. Hoover. Pinch-hitter Wilin Rosario then hit a sacrifice fly to trim Cincinnati's lead to two.	After Charlie Blackmon flied out, Stubbs drove a 1-0 pitch from Hoover (1-9) into the seats in left for his 12th homer. It was Stubbs' third career game-ending homer and first with the Rockies.	Rex Brothers (4-5) picked up the victory despite allowing a pair of runs in the top of the ninth. Nolan Arenado tied a career high with four hits for Colorado. He also had a leadoff walk in the ninth.	Stubbs finished with three hits against his first major league team, and then was doused with ice water by a teammate during an on-field interview after the game.	Dylan Axelrod, making his Reds debut, was scheduled to start the nightcap against Yohan Flande, who is looking for his first major league win.	The doubleheader was set up by Saturday night's water main break outside Coors Field that left the ballpark without running water and forced the game to be pushed back one day. The ruptured water main was repaired by city crews overnight.	Jay Bruce and Kris Negron homered for the Reds, who fell to 10-18 since the All-Star break.	Charlie Blackmon and Corey Dickerson also went deep for the Rockies.	The Rockies' Michael Cuddyer, who won the NL batting title last season, went 1 for 5 in his return from a left shoulder fracture. He was injured June 5 against Arizona when he dove for a sharply hit grounder while playing third base.	A brief thunder shower prompted a 21-minute rain delay in the first.	TRAINER'S ROOM:	Reds: 2B Brandon Phillips (torn left thumb ligament) continued his minor league rehab stint with Class A Dayton on Sunday at Bowling Green. Phillips began the assignment Friday at Triple-A Louisville, going 0 for 2 with a walk against Indianapolis.	Rockies: RHP Tommy Kahnle was placed on the 15-day disabled list because of shoulder inflammation. LHP Brett Anderson (back strain) was transferred from the 15-day DL to the 60-day DL.	UP NEXT:	Reds: RHP Mike Leake (9-11) is slated to pitch Monday's series opener at St. Louis, where Cincinnati has gone 1-10 in its last 11 series.	Rockies: Following an off day, LHP Tyler Matzek (2-8) is slated to pitch Tuesday against RHP James Shields (11-6) in the first of a two-game interleague series against Kansas City.	GAME BALLS:	The game was played with balls embossed with the No. 17 in recognition of Todd Helton, who wore that number during a stellar Colorado career and saw it retired during a pregame ceremony. He's the first player in the team's history to have his number retired.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

WASHINGTON -- Jayson Werth recently said the Washington Nationals were due to go on a run.	On Sunday night, he came off the bench, ailing shoulder and all, and extended the one they're on.	Pinch-hitter Scott Hairston's sacrifice fly with one out in the 11th inning drove in Werth to give the Nationals a 6-5 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Sunday night and complete a three-game sweep.	Werth, who had missed the last five games due to his sore right shoulder, entered the game as a pinch-hitter in the ninth and doubled leading off the 11th against Brandon Cumpton (3-4).	"I haven't swung a bat for like a week, so there's not a whole lot you can do there," Werth said about keeping his timing sharp. "When you play this long and you play this deep in the season, you don't ... it's like when you come back from the All-Star Break, it's not like you miss a whole lot."	Werth went to third on Denard Span's grounder to first. Hairston then sent Cumpton's first pitch to deep left and Werth scored easily after the catch.	"I (was thinking) `just drive the ball to the outfield," Hairston said. "Obviously a hard ground ball can get the job done, too, if it finds a hole, but your percentages are better if you get it to the outfield."	Ross Detwiler (2-2) pitched two innings for the win as Washington won for the second night in a row in its final at-bat.	Span and Anthony Rendon had two hits each for National League East-leading Washington, which has won six straight.	The Pirates were winless on their five-game road trip and have lost five straight for the first time since September 2012.	Both closers blew save chances in the ninth.	Trailing 4-2 entering the inning, the Pirates got one run on a wild pitch and took a 5-4 lead on Gregory Polanco's two-run double off Rafael Soriano.	Washington rallied against Matt Melancon in their half, however. Asdrubal Cabrera's one-out single off the glove of a diving Neil Walker scored Werth, who had walked, from second with the tying run.	"I don't want to come back before I'm ready, but at the same time it felt like we'd progressed enough and felt good enough to get in there," Werth said.	Washington starter Doug Fister allowed two unearned runs in seven innings, and hasn't given up an earned run in his last 22 1/3 innings.	The Nationals trailed 2-1 before a successful challenge started a seventh-inning rally.	A pitch to Michael Taylor was called a foul ball by home plate umpire Andy Fletcher as Taylor started towards first. Manager Matt Williams challenged, saying the 2-1 pitch hit Taylor's hand, and the call was overturned upon review.	Pinch-hitter Kevin Frandsen and Span singled to load the bases. Cabrera, facing reliever Jared Hughes, grounded to first baseman Ike Davis. Davis threw high to home, the ball deflecting off Russell Martin's glove as Taylor scored.	As the ball rolled up the third-base line, Frandsen raced home, putting Washington ahead 3-2.	Rendon then grounded to Pedro Alvarez, who threw high to home for another error, allowing Span to score the Nationals' fourth run.	"We got three ground balls from Hughes in the seventh inning, and an opportunity to put the inning away without letting them score, and we didn't execute plays in either corner," Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said.	Errors by Washington's Ian Desmond and Rendon helped the Pirates take a 2-0 lead in the sixth.	The Nationals cut it to 2-1 in the sixth on Desmond's two-out RBI-single.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: RHP Charlie Morton was placed on the 15-day disabled list with right hip inflammation.	UP NEXT	Pirates: RH Vance Worley (5-2, 2.51) goes against Atlanta on Monday as Pittsburgh opens a three-game homestand. He's 1-2 with a 5.81 ERA in seven career appearances (five starts) against the Braves.	Nationals: Jordan Zimmermann (8-5, 2.92) opposes visiting Arizona in the first of four games. He is 2-0 with a 1.37 ERA in his last three starts.	GLOVE STORIES	For game that featured four errors, there were two exceptional defensive plays. In the eighth, Cabrera fielded Russell Martin's grounder behind second and flipped the ball behind his back to Desmond as part of a 1-4-6-3 double play. In the bottom of the ninth, Starling Marte made a diving catch in center to rob Rendon.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

ATLANTA --  Mike Minor needed a reason to believe he could work his way back to his 2013 form.	Beating Jon Lester could provide that confidence boost.	Minor pitched seven strong innings, Justin Upton and Chris Johnson homered and the Atlanta Braves beat the reeling Oakland Athletics 4-3 on Sunday night, ending Lester's seven-game winning streak.	"That's Mike Minor of old right there," Atlanta first baseman Freddie Freeman said.	The Braves swept the three-game series, leaving the A's with a five-game losing streak, their longest of the season. The A's have lost seven of eight overall and trail the Angels, who lost to Texas on Sunday, by percentage points in the AL West.	"This is really the first bad road trip we've had this year," manager Bob Melvin said. "This was not a good trip. So we've got to get home and we've got to regroup. It will be good to get home in front of our crowd. They're usually good for us."	Minor (5-8), who entered with a 5.33 ERA, allowed two runs in a performance reminiscent of last season, when he was 13-9 with a 3.21 ERA.	"We're going to need him rolling to get us where we're going to go," Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez said.	Oakland's Nate Freiman hit two homers, giving him three in the series, but Minor allowed only two other hits.	"I feel like I'm in a different mindset," Minor said after his second straight quality start.	Craig Kimbrel worked a perfect ninth for his 37th save.	Lester (13-8) allowed four runs, three earned, and six hits in six-plus innings in his first loss since June 7 for the Red Sox at Detroit. He had been 3-0 with a 2.49 ERA in three starts since his July 31 trade to the A's.	Upton hit four homers in the 10-game homestand, including two against the A's. He has hit 16 of his 23 homers at Turner Field.	Freiman led off the second inning with a drive that landed several rows beyond the center-field wall.	The Braves tied it in the bottom half. After Upton singled, Johnson lined to third baseman Josh Donaldson, who threw to first base in an attempt for a double play. The throw hit Upton and rolled into the Atlanta dugout, and Upton was awarded third base. Evan Gattis followed with a run-scoring single to right field.	Phil Gosselin led off the Atlanta fourth with a single to right field. With one out, Upton drove a low, inside pitch from Lester about 10 rows deep into the left-field seats for a 3-1 lead.	"I thought it was a good pitch when I threw it," Lester said. "I went back and looked at it and, good pitch. So sometimes you've got to tip your hat."	0-FOR-EVER	Lester is still waiting for his first career hit. He was 0 for 34 in eight seasons with Boston and his drought continued in his first two at-bats with the A's. He struck out and hit a fly ball to left field.	GOING WITH GOSSELIN	Gosselin was 1 for 4 in his third straight start, including two straight at second base over another rookie, Tommy La Stella, who struck out as a pinch hitter in the seventh. Gosselin hit his first homer in the series opener and had two hits in Saturday night's win.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: CF Craig Gentry, on the 15-day disabled list with a broken right hand, is ready to begin a rehab assignment with Triple-A Sacramento.	Braves: Gonzalez said RHP Shae Simmons (strained right shoulder) will make a second rehab assignment with Triple-A Gwinnett on Monday after throwing 10 pitches without a problem on Saturday.	UP NEXT	Athletics: After an off day on Monday, the A's take on another NL East team when they open a two-game series against the New York Mets on Tuesday night. Scott Kazmir (13-5), who already has matched his career high in wins, will start for Oakland.	Braves: After completing their 10-game homestand, the Braves open a series at Pittsburgh on Monday night as RHP Ervin Santana goes for his 13th win. Santana (12-6) leads the Braves in victories.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

DENVER -- Michael Cuddyer hit for the cycle, including a two-run double in Colorado's five-run eighth inning, and the Rockies rallied again to beat the Cincinnati Reds 10-5 to complete a doubleheader sweep Sunday night.	Drew Stubbs finished off Colorado's five-run ninth inning with a three-run homer off J.J. Hoover, sending the Rockies to a 10-9 victory in the first game.	Cuddyer, reinstated from the disabled list earlier in the day after missing 60 games with a left shoulder fracture, tripled in the first, homered in the fifth and singled in the seventh to become the seventh Rockies player to hit for the cycle and first since Carlos Gonzalez on July 31, 2010 against the Chicago Cubs.	Adam Ottavino (1-4) picked up the win in relief and reliever Carlos Contreras (0-1), who allowed five runs in 1⅓ innings, took the loss.	Ryan Ludwick had a two-run homer in the sixth off Yohan Flande to help the Reds take a 5-2 lead into the seventh. But the Rockies pulled even in their half of the seventh with the help of the Reds' second error, which came with the bases loaded and one out after Colorado had pulled within two. Reds third baseman Ramon Santiago cleanly fielded Nolan Arenado's hard RBI bouncer down the line and stepped on the bag for the force, but his throw to first was wide and rolled onto the dirt track in foul territory, allowing two runners to cross the plate.	That set the stage for another big finish by the Rockies. After Brandon Barnes and Charlie Culberson each singled with one out in the eighth, Manny Parra relieved Contreras, and Josh Rutledge beat out an infield single to load the bases with two outs. Corey Dickerson, who earlier extended his hitting streak to 12 games, and Cuddyer followed with successive two-run doubles.	Cuddyer sent his drive down the third-base line and emphatically clapped his hands as he pulled into second base. It was his second career cycle. He also did it against Milwaukee on May 22, 2009 while with the Minnesota Twins.	In the first game, the Reds carried a 9-5 lead into the ninth, but All-Star closer Aroldis Chapman walked four straight batters before he was replaced by Hoover. Pinch hitter Wilin Rosario then hit a sacrifice fly to trim Cincinnati's lead to two.	After Blackmon flied out, Stubbs drove a 1-0 pitch from Hoover (1-9) into the seats in left-center for his 12th homer. It was Stubbs' third career game-ending homer and first with the Rockies.	He finished with three hits against his first major league team, and then was doused with ice water by a teammate during an on-field interview after the game.	"They're the team that drafted me and brought me to the big leagues, so I got a lot of friends over there, a lot of people I have good relationships with," Stubbs said. "But at the same time, it's always nice when a team trades you to get a little retribution."	It was a tough loss for the Reds.	"I don't think I can put it into words to be honest with you," manager Bryan Price said. "The fact that [I've got to talk about it] right now is very difficult. We're six minutes removed from the game being over.	"I'm not angry at anybody, but it's a difficult loss to take."	Rex Brothers (4-5) picked up the victory despite allowing a pair of runs in the top of the ninth. Arenado tied a career high with four hits for Colorado, and he also had a leadoff walk in the ninth.	The doubleheader was set up by Saturday night's water main break outside Coors Field that left the ballpark without running water and forced the game to be pushed back one day. The water main was repaired by city crews overnight.	Jay Bruce and Kris Negron homered for the Reds.	A brief thunder shower prompted a 21-minute rain delay in the first.	TRAINER'S ROOM:	Reds: 2B Brandon Phillips (torn left thumb ligament) continued his minor league rehab stint with Class A Dayton on Sunday at Bowling Green. Phillips began the assignment Friday at Triple-A Louisville, going 0-for-2 with a walk against Indianapolis.	UP NEXT:	Reds: RHP Mike Leake (9-11) is slated to pitch Monday's series opener at St. Louis, where Cincinnati has gone 1-10 in its past 11 series.	Rockies: Following an off day, LHP Tyler Matzek (2-8) is slated to pitch Tuesday against RHP James Shields (11-6) in the first of a two-game interleague series against Kansas City.	GAME BALLS:	The first game was played with balls embossed with the No. 17 in recognition of Todd Helton, who wore that number during a stellar Colorado career and saw it retired during a pregame ceremony. He's the first player in the team's history to have his number retired.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

NEW YORK --  On days Kyle Hendricks is on the mound, he can count on Javier Baez, his buddy from the minor leagues, for plenty of run support.	It's a combo beleaguered Cubs' fans can get excited about.	Hendricks and two relievers held New York to four or fewer hits for the fifth straight game, Baez and Anthony Rizzo homered, and Chicago rallied for a 4-1 victory over the Mets on Monday.	"When he's pitching and he got a good game, I got a good game, too," Baez said.	Teammates at Triple-A Iowa for much of the season, Baez hit two homers in his third career game to help make Hendricks a winner in his fifth career start -- on Aug. 7. This time, Baez's mammoth two-run shot into the second deck in left field off Mets closer Jenrry Mejia put Chicago up 4-1.	"That's typical right there," Hendricks said of the homer. "Not really shocking for us."	Hendricks (5-1) gave up three hits in seven innings, allowing only Lucas Duda's home run in the fourth. The right-hander won his fourth straight start -- yielding four earned runs over 29 1/3 innings.	"I wasn't that sharp but then made that mistake to Duda and it kind of locked me in after that," Hendricks said.	Neil Ramirez struck out two in a perfect eighth and Hector Rondon allowed a leadoff double but finished the four-hitter for his 18th save.	The Cubs came back once Carlos Torres, making a spot start for Bartolo Colon, was done after five innings.	Luis Valbuena, who had three hits, had a tying single in the sixth. Rizzo connected off Buddy Carlyle (1-1) in the eighth for his 28th homer.	The Mets had only 16 hits but split the four-game series with the Cubs. The five-game run matches the club's longest streak of games with no more than four hits. They also went five straight in 2004 and 1963.	The only time since 1914 the Cubs gave up four or fewer hits in four straight games was in 1983.	"Maybe they're swinging too much," manager Terry Collins said. "It's trying not to do too much, just try to put the barrel on the baseball."	The 41-year-old Colon had to return to the Dominican Republic, where his mother was sick, forcing the durable Torres to make his first start since Sept. 27. He yielded three hits.	Colon's winter ball team, the Cibao Eagles, confirmed later Monday Colon's mother died.	The Mets will place Colon on the bereavement list and recall right-hander Gonzalez Germen from Triple-A Las Vegas on Tuesday.	Torres became the first pitcher to start on no days' rest since the Angels' Billy Buckner did it June 25, 26 of last year. Torres threw nine pitches in facing two batters in the Mets' 2-1 loss Sunday.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: OF Chris Coghlan was out of the starting lineup. "We've been pushing him pretty hard," manager Rick Renteria said. Coghlan has been playing with a sore left big toe. As a pinch hitter, he grounded out with the bases loaded in the eight.	Mets: RHP Daisuke Matsuzaka could be activated from the DL to replace Colon. Matsuzaka (elbow inflammation) made a rehab start Saturday, allowing one run and three hits over six innings for Double-A Binghamton.	UP NEXT	Cubs: LHP Tsuyoshi Wada (2-1) will make his seventh big league start when Cubs host the San Francisco Giants on Tuesday.	Mets: RHP Dillon Gee (4-5) is set for his first start at the Oakland Coliseum. He gave up four runs in four innings vs. the A's at Citi Field on June 21, 2011.	QUICK REVIEW	Renteria challenged two plays, winning one and losing one. The total time for the two reviews was 1 minute, 23 seconds. Umpires needed 55 seconds to overturn a safe call on Matt den Dekker's attempted steal in the fourth. It only took 28 seconds to uphold an out call at first base in the fifth.	GETTING BETTER	The Cubs improved to 9-8 this month. Last year they were 8-20 in August.

WASHINGTON -- Washington Nationals manager Matt Williams said Monday that the last time he was part of three consecutive walk-off wins he was playing for the Arizona Diamondbacks. This time, the Diamondbacks were the ones being beaten.	Adam LaRoche hit a game-winning solo home run with two outs in the 11th inning to help the Nationals beat the Diamondbacks 5-4 on Monday for their seventh straight win. It was the third walk-off win in as many days for NL-East-leading Washington, with the first two coming against the Pirates.	"They don't come around very often, that's for sure," Williams said. "But [we] just keep fighting, which is a great trait to have."	LaRoche sent a 3-1 pitch from Will Harris (0-3) off the wall in the back of the Nationals bullpen for his first career walk-off homer and was mobbed by his teammates at home plate.	"I got every bit of it, I did," LaRoche said. "Just a crazy few days. I don't know how we've gotten these walk-off situations the last few days, but we have and have been able to grind back."	It was LaRoche's first career walk-off homer.	"[It's] nice to get my first one -- it took me long enough," the 34-year-old said.	Winning pitcher Craig Stammen (3-4) pitched out of a bases-loaded, no-outs jam in the top of the inning.	"We missed our opportunity, [with] me striking out instead of putting the ball in play," said Didi Gregorius, who made the second out against Stammen.	Arizona tied it 4-4 when David Peralta led off the ninth with a solo homer off Tyler Clippard.	Washington trailed 3-2 when Denard Span doubled against Brad Ziegler with one out in the eighth, and Anthony Rendon followed with a triple to tie it. Jayson Werth then scored Rendon with a sacrifice fly.	Miguel Montero had three hits for Arizona, and rookie Ender Inciarte extended his hitting streak to 18 games.	Arizona had taken the lead in the top of the eighth. Jake Lamb drew a lead-off walk off Jordan Zimmermann, and Gregorius sent a 3-2 fastball into the Nationals bullpen for his fifth home run.	Wilson Ramos had given Washington a 2-1 lead with a two-run homer off Arizona starter Vidal Nuno in the seventh.	Nuno, winless in eight starts with the Diamondbacks, pitched well and allowed two runs and five hits over seven innings.	Zimmermann went seven-plus innings and allowed three runs on four hits. His three walks were a season-high. He faced the minimum through four innings, thanks to a pair of double plays. In the fifth however, the first two Diamondbacks reached base via a walk and a single. Manager Kirk Gibson had No. 6 hitter Jordan Pacheco bunt the runners over, and Lamb's sacrifice fly made it 1-0.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: SS Chris Owings, on this disabled list with a strained left shoulder, began a rehab assignment Sunday with the team's Arizona Rookie League affiliate and went 2-for-3.	Nationals: Werth (sore shoulder) was in the starting lineup for the first time since Aug. 10. OF Nate McLouth, out since Aug. 2 with right shoulder inflammation, was scheduled to undergo an Arthrogram -- an MRI procedure that involves dye injected into the joint -- Monday to help determine the extent of his injury.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: RH Chase Anderson (7-4, 3.16) is 2-0 with a 2.19 ERA in his past six starts.	Nationals: RH Stephen Strasburg (9-10, 2.53) pitches Tuesday at Nationals Park, where he's 7-2 with a 2.41 ERA this season.	SCARY MOMENT	Washington second baseman Asdrubal Cabrera was shaken up but remained in the game after a third-inning collision at second base. On a sacrifice bunt attempt by Jordan Zimmermann, Cabrera slid into second, and the side of his head slammed against the knee of Gregorius, who was fielding the throw. Cabrera remained on the ground for several minutes as manager Matt Williams and the trainer came out to check on him.	STREAKING DIAMONDBACKS	Inciarte is tied with Jose Abreu of the White Sox for the second longest hit streak by a rookie this season. Abreu had a 21-game streak as well. Mark Trumbo (1-for-4 with a walk) has reached base safely in 17 straight games, and he has hit safely in 15 of 17, with 21-for-61 batting (.344).	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PHILADELPHIA --  Maybe Jerome Williams just needed a new catcher.	Williams took a three-hitter into the eighth inning, Andres Blanco hit his first homer in three years, and the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Seattle Mariners 4-1 in an interleague game Monday night.	Making his second start since joining the Phillies, Williams (1-0) allowed one run and three hits in seven-plus innings.	"I'm doing things I haven't done before because he has confidence in me," Williams said about catcher Carlos Ruiz. "My game plan wasn't working this year. That's why I'm on my third team. We're just using the same weapons, but moving the ball around. With Chooch behind the plate, I'm not shaking him off. I trust him. I was hard-headed before. I wanted to do it my way. My way got me off two teams."	The Phillies claimed Williams off waivers from Texas to fill a spot in the rotation after Roberto Hernandez was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers. Williams was 2-5 with a 6.71 ERA for the Rangers and Houston this season. But he has a 2.19 ERA in 12 1/3 innings with Philadelphia.	"Jerome was solid, had a stress-free outing," manager Ryne Sandberg said. "He was outstanding."	Mariners rookie Roenis Elias (9-10) gave up one run and three hits in four innings. The left-hander constantly pitched out of jams because he walked six and hit one batter with a pitch.	"I was erratic with my fastball," Elias said through a translator. "I felt good physically, but it just wasn't my day."	Blanco connected for a three-run shot off reliever Dominic Leone in the fifth to give the Phillies a 4-0 lead. It was his first home run since July 1, 2011, for Texas against Florida.	"I feel proud coming back," Blanco said of returning to the majors after missing two years following shoulder surgery.	Marlon Byrd's RBI double in the third gave the Phillies a 1-0 lead. Elias escaped further trouble by striking out Cody Asche with the bases loaded. Elias also left the bases full in the fourth by retiring Ryan Howard on a grounder.	Williams left after hitting Chris Taylor with a pitch leading off the eighth. Ken Giles entered and allowed an RBI double to Dustin Ackley with one out. Giles then struck out Robinson Cano and Kendrys Morales to leave runners on second and third.	Jonathan Papelbon pitched a scoreless ninth for his 29th save in 32 tries.	Seattle had won 12 of its previous 16 games. The Mariners fell into a tie with Detroit for the second wild-card spot in the AL. They're seeking their first postseason appearance since 2001.	The last-place Phillies, who are heading toward their second straight losing season, opened a nine-game homestand with just their third win in the last 10 games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: RHP Felix Hernandez is fine after an early exit and plans to start at Boston on Friday night. The five-time All-Star left after five innings because he was hit by a one-hopper off Ian Kinsler's bat in the fourth inning of his most recent start Saturday in Detroit.	Phillies: OF John Mayberry Jr. is scheduled to begin a rehab assignment at Triple-A Lehigh Valley on Tuesday. Mayberry has been sidelined since July 21 because of an injured left wrist. He's batting .213 with six homers and 21 RBIs.	UP NEXT	Mariners: RHP Hisashi Iwakuma (11-6, 2.72 ERA) goes Tuesday night. He is 3-1 with a 1.27 ERA in his last four starts.	Phillies: RHP A.J. Burnett (6-13, 4.35 ERA) tries to snap a five-game losing streak. Burnett hasn't won since July 11. He's 0-5 with a 6.54 ERA in his last six starts.	BIG BEN	Phillies CF Ben Revere was 2 for 5, raising his average to .315, second in the NL to Justin Morneau's .323. The Phillies haven't had a batting champion since Hall of Famer Richie Ashburn hit .350 in 1958. Revere has only 13 RBIs. The fewest RBIs for a batting champ is 27 by Matty Alou in 1966.	WELCOME TO PHILLY	The Mariners played their first game in Citizens Bank Park, which opened in 2004. Seattle swept a three-game series at Veterans Stadium in 2003 in its only other trip to Philadelphia.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PITTSBURGH --  Ervin Santana said "everything" was off when he took the mound Monday.	No matter. His Atlanta Braves teammates gave him a six-run lead before he threw a pitch.	Jason Heyward and Andrelton Simmons homered to begin a big first inning, and the Braves beat the sliding Pittsburgh Pirates 7-3 on Monday night for their fourth consecutive victory.	The early outburst was enough for Santana, who allowed three solo homers among nine hits in 5 1/3 innings.	"I know I didn't have my stuff today, but for me it was one of my best games because I gave up three runs," said Santana (13-6), who improved to 8-1 over his past 10 starts. "Anytime you give up three runs or less, it's a good outing. So I'll take it".	Pittsburgh has lost six in a row. Starling Marte went deep twice, and Neil Walker added a homer that became the first to reach the Allegheny River beyond right field at PNC Park this season.	Relievers Luis Avilan, David Hale and James Russell combined for 3 2/3 hitless innings for Atlanta, which broke a tie with Pittsburgh for third place in the National League wild-card standings.	"We went through these tough stretches in April and early May and we've played really good baseball up until this last week," Pirates second baseman Neil Walker said. "We're still the same team."	Heyward and Simmons started the game with the Braves' fifth set of back-to-back home runs this season, and it got worse from there for Vance Worley (5-3). Chris Johnson and Gerald Laird had run-scoring singles as Atlanta bolted to a 6-0 lead.	"I know we didn't score a whole lot the rest of the way," said Heyward, who had had three hits and a sacrifice fly.  "But still, that's a lot of pressure for a team to come back against."	Worley managed to pitch six innings and was charged with five earned runs. He allowed nine hits, struck out four and walked two.	"After (the first inning), I figured it out," Worley said. "It clicked, I was able to drive the ball down in the zone and get the results that I needed."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Braves: During a rehabilitation outing for Triple-A Gwinnett, RHP Shae Simmons (right shoulder strain) did not record an out and was charged with four runs. He walked two and allowed two hits while throwing 21 pitches.	Pirates: After taking live batting practice prior to the game, OF Andrew McCutchen (left rib fracture) said he expects to come off the DL on Tuesday. ... SS Jordy Mercer (right forearm tightness) was not in the lineup for the fourth consecutive game.	A FIRST AT FIRST	The Pirates' Pedro Alvarez started at first base in his first career appearance at any spot other than third. Alvarez, whose 25 errors lead the majors, had seven put-outs. His first chance was an errant throw by second baseman Neil Walker that led to two runs being scored.	LATE ARRIVAL	Because the Braves did not get into Pittsburgh until 3 a.m. Monday morning, manager Fredi Gonzalez elected to rest regulars B.J. Upton and Evan Gattis.	BACK-TO-BACK BEGINNING	Heyward's homer was his third of the season to lead off a game and sixth of his career. According to STATS, Monday was the fifth time the Braves began a game with consecutive home runs.	UP NEXT	Braves: Tuesday starter RHP Aaron Harang (9-7, 3.51 ERA) has 15 career wins against the Pirates.	Pirates: Despite having a 2.36 ERA over 42 innings in seven starts since coming off the DL, LHP Francisco Liriano (3-9, 3.78 ERA) has lost three of five decisions. He's lost his past two outings.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BOSTON -- Kevin Jepsen hadn't earned a save in nearly two years, but he certainly deserved this one, after a clutch strikeout of Boston bopper David Ortiz.	Mike Trout and Albert Pujols hit consecutive RBI doubles, and the Los Angeles Angels extended their AL West lead with a 4-2 victory over the Red Sox on Monday night.	With two runners on and none out in the ninth, Jepsen threw a well-executed changeup to Ortiz that moved off the plate and got Big Papi to swing and miss wildly.	"I wanted to give him a pitch he thinks he can drive, but it fades out of the zone. In that situation, I'm going for the strikeout," Jepsen said. "Watching him, I've seen him come up a ton of times in that situation and tie it up."	Jepsen then got Yoenis Cespedes to bounce into a run-scoring fielder's choice before Mike Napoli lined to center, which closed out Jepsen's first save since Sept. 16, 2012. It was the fifth win in six games for the Angels, who moved a half-game ahead of idle Oakland.	"That's a great pitch," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "It's a tough situation. David can beat you at any part of this ballpark on a variety of pitches, and you've got to make your pitches there."	Ortiz reached base four times with a double, a single and two walks for the Red Sox, who have lost three of four after winning four straight. Boston was 1-for-14 with runners in scoring position and stranded 12 overall.	Angels starter C.J. Wilson (10-8) labored through 5 1/3 innings, as he gave up one run and five hits with five walks and five strikeouts.	Brandon Workman (1-7) lost his sixth straight start and gave up two runs and six hits in seven innings. He was skipped for a couple turns to rest his arm.	"My velocity was better," Workman said. "I had a chance to work on some things, mechanically. I felt good tonight. I felt like I got into a nice rhythm early and was able to carry that through."	The Angels broke ahead 2-0 on two-out doubles by Trout and Pujols after Kole Calhoun walked in the third.	Brock Holt extended his hitting streak to 12 games with an RBI single, which cut it to 2-1 in the fourth.	Los Angeles added two runs in the eighth when reliever Junichi Tazawa bobbled a grounder and made a wild throw with the bases loaded. He was charged with two errors on the play.	"Unfortunately, what looked like a potential inning-ending double play turned into a couple of runs for them," Boston manager John Farrell said.	The Red Sox had the bases loaded with one out in the sixth, but Dustin Pedroia bounced into a double play against reliever Mike Morin.	NICE GRAB	The most important catch of the game might have been made by Scioscia. With the entire infield shifted to the right for Ortiz, Wilson had to run hard toward the Angels dugout for a short foul pop. The ball bounced in front of a hard-charging Wilson, who hopped down the dugout steps and was caught by Scioscia, with hitting coach Don Baylor assisting. "I saw the ball, he kept coming and I said, `No,'" Scioscia said. "Luckily, we caught him. We don't need anybody rolling another ankle doing something like that."	CHANGE THAT TUNE	A day after his mental gaffe cost the Red Sox in a loss to Houston, SS Xander Bogaerts changed his walkup music to "Rude" by Magic!. He went 0-or-4 and stranded two runners.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Scioscia said INF Grant Green, on the 15-day disabled list with a strained lower back, is "close to playing in games." He'll likely need a few rehab starts before he returns.	Red Sox: Pedroia was back in the lineup after missing Sunday's game because he was sick. OF/1B Allen Craig (sprained left foot) started a rehab assignment with Triple-A Pawtucket. C David Ross (plantar fasciitis) is expected to be activated Tuesday.	UP NEXT	RHP Jered Weaver (13-7, 3.66 ERA) goes for the Angels in the second game of the series Tuesday. He took the loss against Boston on Aug. 8, when he gave up four runs in six innings.	RHP Allen Webster (3-1, 4.79) faces the Angels for the second time in three starts. He earned the win against Weaver recently by holding Los Angeles to two runs in 6 2/3 innings.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO -- Nick Markakis preserved the lead on defense and then enlarged it at the plate. The right fielder hit a two-run homer after preventing one with a leaping catch and sent the Baltimore Orioles to an 8-2 victory over the Chicago White Sox on Monday.	Although offense usually is the focus, Markakis didn't hesitate when asked which moment felt better.	"Robbing a two-run homer," he said, "especially in that situation."	Nelson Cruz and J.J. Hardy each added a solo shot as the Orioles upped their AL East lead to 7 1/2 games over the idle New York Yankees. Cruz hit his 32nd homer and passed White Sox rookie Jose Abreu for the American League lead. Cruz is tied with Giancarlo Stanton of the Miami Marlins for most in the majors.	Markakis went 3-for-5 with two RBIs and two runs, but everyone in the Baltimore locker room was talking about his clutch catch.	"That was big," manager Buck Showalter said. "The score won't look like it, but obviously it was a big play."	The Orioles entered the bottom of the seventh with a 3-0 lead after starter Bud Norris (11-7) retired 17 of his first 18 batters. But he quickly found himself in trouble in the seventh after he hit De Aza with a pitch and gave up a double to Alexei Ramirez that put runners on second and third with the heart of the Chicago lineup coming up. Abreu flied out to shallow center, and Adam Dunn struck out. It appeared Norris might escape with his shutout intact, but Avisail Garcia's two-run single made it 3-2.	Conor Gillaspie followed with a drive to deep right field, and Markakis raced back to the fence and made a leaping grab.	"I thought I had a shot at it all the way," he said. "I was going after it. I was doing everything I can to catch it, with the situation of the game and the way Bud was pitching. It helped us out tremendously and kind of took the wind out of their sails a little bit."	The Orioles then broke it open with a five-run eighth. Jonathan Schoop doubled in three runs, and Markakis hit a two-run homer to cap the rally.	Chicago ace Chris Sale (10-3) took the loss, after yielding three runs and eight hits in six innings. He has dropped two straight decisions. The Orioles are the only AL team he hasn't beaten in his career.	"We were a great outfielder away from potentially winning that game," Sale said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: 3B Manny Machado will miss at least another week due to the sprained right knee he sustained while taking a swing Aug. 11. There's no timetable for his return. Machado didn't play this season until May 1 because of offseason surgery on his left knee.	White Sox: CF Adam Eaton (strained right oblique) continues to make progress, and the hope is he'll be ready to return when he's eligible to be activated from the 15-day disabled list Sunday. However, he is likely to go to the minors for a rehab stint before then.	UP NEXT	In the second game of the series Tuesday, Orioles RHP Chris Tillman (9-5, 3.68 ERA) faces LHP Jose Quintana (6-9, 3.14).	ALL DUNN?	Adam Dunn's four-year, $40 million contract is up at the end of this season, and the White Sox slugger hinted Monday at the possibility he could retire.	Dunn, who turns 35 in November, has 459 homers and could move way up the career list by sticking around a few more years (he's just three from tying Jose Canseco for 34th place). But he said numbers -- and even the possibility of hitting 500 homers -- won't be a determining factor.	"It's going to be a decision where I'm going to sit down with the people who are important to me and make a quick decision," Dunn said. "Whether it's tomorrow [or] whether it's February, I don't know."	WAITING GAME	RHP Miguel Gonzalez, who was sent to the minors Aug. 9, is expected to be back with the Orioles this weekend to start against the Cubs. Gonzalez threw a simulated game in the minors Monday -- Double-A Bowie had the day off -- to prepare for the potential assignment.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Erik Kratz had played in only five games for Kansas City since being acquired from Toronto in a trade on July 28.	But the big guy always stayed ready and that discipline paid off Monday night to keep the Royals rolling.	Kratz homered twice after replacing an ailing Salvador Perez, and Jason Vargas pitched seven strong innings to lead the first-place Royals to a 6-4 victory over the Minnesota Twins.	"You put your work in before the game as a bench guy to be ready to go in," Kratz said. "Some people could say well, Salvi plays every day, so why not take a day off? In my opinion, what's the point of taking a day off if that might be the day you come in and play?"	Vargas (10-5) allowed one run on four this and struck out three, but had his scoreless innings streak snapped at 17 when Oswaldo Arcia hit a solo homer in the seventh. Perez had two hits and two RBIs before leaving in the seventh because of discomfort in his right knee, helping the Royals win for the 21st time in 26 games.	Kansas City extended its lead over the idle Detroit Tigers in the AL Central to two games.	Trevor May (0-2) gave up three runs on seven hits and walked four in 4 2/3 innings for the Twins.	When Perez left, Kratz came in as a pinch hitter and broke his bat on a pitch from Anthony Swarzak, but still managed to muscle it over the wall in left field for a 4-0 lead. Kratz added a solo shot to center in the ninth for his first multihomer game.	The drives proved even more important when Trevor Plouffe hit a three-run homer off Aaron Crow in the ninth inning.	"It's great to help the team out when you do get in there for any bench guy," Kratz said.	Greg Holland came on for his 38th save in 40 tries. Josh Willingham had three hits and Alex Gordon and Billy Butler each had two for the Royals, who have won eight straight series for the first time since 1991.	May made his major league debut on Aug. 9, and it was a rough one. He walked seven batters in two innings and gave up four runs. He breezed through four innings of his home debut, but walked the bases loaded in the fifth.	Perez followed with a two-run single and Butler added an RBI single to give the Royals a 3-0 lead.	That was enough for Vargas, who has dominated the Twins this season. He retired 10 in a row from the second through sixth while his offense built him a cushion.	"Salvi's a huge part of our team, but we have to keep him healthy and keep him in it for the long haul," Vargas said. "For Kratz to come in and step up and go big fly twice was pretty nice, especially when they were able to extend the game a little bit there. Those two home runs really counted."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals: Perez is day to day with a sore knee. Manager Ned Yost said Perez tweaked a tendon in his knee while running the bases in the fifth inning, but was removed purely as a precaution.	Twins: Byron Buxton, one of the top prospects in baseball, flew to Fort Myers, Florida, to begin his recovery after a nasty outfield collision at Double-A New Britain. GM Terry Ryan said Buxton had a stiff neck and some headaches, but nothing more serious. Ryan said he doubts Buxton will play again this season.	"We're all fortunate it ended up the way it ended up," Ryan said. "We've seen collisions in our day, but that one ranked right up there."	UP NEXT	The Royals open a two-game interleague series in Colorado. RHP James Shields (11-6, 3.29 ERA) starts the opener against LHP Tyler Matzek (2-8, 5.50).	The Twins stay home for a three-game series against Cleveland. RHP Kyle Gibson (11-9, 3.96) starts the opener against RHP Trevor Bauer (4-7, 4.35).	EARLY EXIT	Twins manager Ron Gardenhire didn't stick around very long. When plate umpire Chris Segal called Joe Mauer out on strikes in the first inning, the mild-mannered first baseman argued that he fouled the third strike and it hit the dirt before Perez caught it. Segal disagreed, and Gardenhire came to Mauer's defense before returning to the bench. Moments later, Segal ejected Gardenhire after the conversation apparently continued from the dugout. It was the fifth time this season and 72nd time in his career that Gardenhire was ejected.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK --  Anyone who thought Houston would be a Yankee Stadium pushover hasn't been paying attention to Chris Carter at the plate.	After striking out four straight times, Carter snapped a ninth-inning tie with a colossal three-run homer Tuesday night that extended his second-half power surge and sent the Astros to a 7-4 victory over the New York Yankees.	"I was just trying to hit it and put it in play. My first four at-bats, I didn't do anything," Carter said with a smile. "I went up there in the last at-bat and just tried to forget about it and regroup."	Marwin Gonzalez knocked in two runs with a pinch-hit single, and the fourth-place Astros (53-73) won for the third time in four meetings with the Yankees this year. Despite a $154 million difference in opening-day payroll, Houston took two of three at home against New York to begin the season.	"Shows us that we're on the right track," winning pitcher Josh Fields said. "We're playing a lot better baseball than last year."	Brian McCann hit a two-run homer, and Martin Prado had three hits for the Yankees, who dropped the opener of a six-game homestand against two teams with losing records.	New York fell four games out of a playoff spot.	"We were able to come back and tie the game up and we let it slip away," manager Joe Girardi said.	David Robertson (1-4) walked consecutive batters and threw seven straight balls before Carter launched a 3-0 pitch into the raised concrete bleachers in left field for his 30th home run.	"I tried to make a good pitch down and away. Instead, I threw it right into his bat path, and he put it 30 rows deep," Robertson said. "I struggled out there tonight and I blew it for our team."	Carter, the reigning AL player of the week, is batting .340 with eight homers and 19 RBIs in his past 13 games. He leads the majors with 17 home runs and 42 RBIs since July 1.	"It was like somebody flipped a light switch," Fields said.	Fields (3-6) tossed a scoreless eighth on his 29th birthday. With the infield in, Jacoby Ellsbury was thrown out at home on a one-out grounder to shortstop by slumping Carlos Beltran.	Chad Qualls worked a perfect ninth for his 14th save.	Prado singled in the fourth off starter Brett Oberholtzer before McCann drove an 0-2 pitch into the second deck in right for his 14th homer.	Robbie Grossman hit a two-out RBI single in the fifth, and Houston chased Chris Capuano on his 36th birthday during a three-run sixth. Fowler led off with a triple and scored on Jason Castro's tying groundout. After consecutive singles, both runners moved up when Jake Marisnick's groundout deflected off reliever Adam Warren.	Astros manager Bo Porter pushed the right button, lifting No. 9 batter Gregorio Petit for a left-handed hitter even though Petit had doubled both times up. Gonzalez hit a two-run single that gave Houston a 4-2 lead.	It was the first run-scoring hit by a Houston pinch hitter since Jesus Guzman had an RBI single against Texas on May 14.	"I didn't think that I was going in that early," Gonzalez said. "Bo told me like 10 minutes before."	Prado tied it in the bottom half with a two-run double that ended Oberholtzer's night.	ON THE GREEN	Tiger Woods was on the field during batting practice before heading to the runway behind the Yankees dugout, where the golf star greeted injured New York pitcher Masahiro Tanaka and then Astros outfielder Dexter Fowler.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: Guzman was activated from the disabled list, and LHP Darin Downs was placed on the 15-day DL, retroactive to Aug. 15, with a strained muscle on his right side. Guzman had been sidelined since Aug. 2 because of back spasms. ... OF Alex Presley, sidelined since July 8 with a strained right oblique, joined the team to receive treatment but won't be activated from the DL for a while.	Yankees: Tanaka (elbow) plans to throw another bullpen Wednesday. ... Girardi said a decision on whether to use RHP David Phelps (elbow inflammation) as a starter or reliever when he gets back probably will depend on how long he's out.	UP NEXT	Yankees RHP Michael Pineda (2-2, 1.82 ERA) makes his second start since a long injury layoff in the second game of the series. RHP Scott Feldman (6-9, 4.45) gets the ball for Houston.	BAD TIMING	Robertson had gone 27 games without giving up a home run since Josh Willingham connected for Minnesota on June 1 at Yankee Stadium.	POWER RESTORED	Carter became the first Astros player to reach 30 homers in a season since Lance Berkman (34) and Carlos Lee (32) in 2007.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

WASHINGTON -- After three straight walk-offs, the Washington Nationals went for a cakewalk instead.	Sure, winning late over and over again is a thrill, but it's not good for the blood pressure -- not to mention the bullpen's workload. Stephen Strasburg provided much of the salve Tuesday night, allowing one run and three hits over a season-high eight innings as the Nationals ran their winning streak to eight games with an 8-1 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks.	"I guess it's what the doctor ordered," Strasburg said.	That, along with a six-run third inning. Asdrubal Cabrera's bases-clearing double blew the game open, giving Washington an overdue breather in what is now its longest winning run since August 2012.	"I think we're just coming together," said shortstop Ian Desmond, who had four RBIs. "We've kind of established our way, I guess you would say."	Success had come with suspense for the Nats: four consecutive one-run games, including the last three decided by the final at-bat, and the last two in the 11th inning.	But Strasburg (10-10) did just what the Nationals needed him to do: eat up innings to give the overtaxed relievers a break. He struck out four to give him a National League-leading 198 for the season, besting his previous single-season high of 197 in 2012 -- the year he was shut down early after returning from elbow surgery.	"The way Stephen pitched is, I hope, indicative of what we're going to see in the future," Desmond said. "He's been great a lot in his career, but tonight was one of those games where it was really fun to watch."	The Nationals sent seven batters to the plate in the third before the Diamondbacks could record an out. Rookie Chase Anderson (7-5) faced six of them, allowing five singles and a walk before he was pulled in the shortest outing of his young career.	Jayson Werth's broken-bat single up the middle scored the first Nationals run, and Desmond's single brought in two more. After Bryce Harper's single loaded the bases, Anderson was pulled for Eury De La Rosa, who gave up Cabrera's drive that took one bounce before hitting the wall in right-center.	"I just kind of didn't attack the guys like I should attack," Anderson said. "I think if you execute pitches and get ahead, you can kind of get anybody out. That's just the name of the game."	David Peralta's first-inning home run accounted for all the scoring for the Diamondbacks, who have lost four straight.	MAYBE I SHOULDN'T TELL THE SKIPPER	Nationals manager Matt Williams praised Desmond's ability to "shorten down" on a swing that produced a pair of runs: "He's going to get a bunch of homers, we know that, but when he can take a two-run single, he's feeling it and he's seeing the ball good."	Oops. Turns out it was an accident. Desmond said he was just trying to fight off a pitch.	"I don't know if I chose to shorten up," Desmond said. "I think the 'jammage' probably shortened me up a little bit."	ENDER'S END GAME	Diamondbacks CF Ender Inciarte grounded out in the ninth to finish an 0-for-4 night, ending his team rookie record hitting streak at 18 games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals OF Nate McLouth will have surgery Thursday for a torn labrum in his right shoulder and is done for the year. He hit .173 with one home run and seven RBIs in 79 games in his first season in Washington.	UP NEXT	Arizona's Trevor Cahill (3-8, 4.68 ERA) faces Tanner Roark (12-7, 2.93) on Wednesday night in the third game of the four-game set.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PHILADELPHIA -- The Mariners gave Hisashi Iwakuma an early lead and the pitcher took it from there.	Iwakuma struck out a season-high 11 batters in eight scoreless innings and Kyle Seager homered to lead the Seattle Mariners to a 5-2 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Tuesday night.	Mike Zunino was 0-for-17 before getting two hits and driving in two runs. The Mariners, who scored two runs in the first, have won 11 of their last 14.	"We had the lead early, which is big for me, for my pitching, because I'm all about pitching to contact," Iwakuma said through an interpreter.	Iwakuma (12-6) was masterful while allowing four hits and no walks. Since July 1, the right-hander is 7-2 with a 1.63 ERA, 65 strikeouts and four walks in 72 innings over 10 starts.	"He was outstanding," Mariners manager Lloyd McClendon said. "He commanded all of his pitches. He was in and out, up and down. Did a tremendous job for us."	The Phillies, who have scored three runs or less 65 times this season, got just one batter to second base against Iwakuma. They have lost six of their last eight.	The Mariners needed three pitchers in the ninth to preserve the victory. The last of the trio, Fernando Rodney, came on with two outs and the tying run at the plate and struck out Cody Asche to record his 36th save in 39 opportunities.	"We have a strong belief in our bullpen, so I was able to watch the TV very calmly," Iwakuma said.	Asked if he was tempted to let Iwakuma come out for the ninth, McClendon said, "No, no."	The Phillies avoided their 14th shutout when Chase Utley scored on Yoervis Medina's wild pitch. Domonic Brown followed with an RBI double to pull Philadelphia within 5-2 before Medina hit Carlos Ruiz to put runners on first and second for Asche.	A.J. Burnett (6-14) lost his fifth straight decision and dropped to 0-6 with a 6.41 ERA in seven starts since the All-Star break. He allowed six hits with four walks and hit two batters in 7 2/3 innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: RF Michael Saunders, who has been on the DL since July 11 with a strained left oblique, made his 10th rehab start Tuesday night for Triple-A Tacoma. Entering Tuesday, he was batting .258 at Tacoma.	Phillies: OF John Mayberry Jr. played in his first rehab game with Triple-A Lehigh Valley at Pawtucket on Tuesday night. Mayberry has been on the DL since July 21 with left wrist inflammation.	UP NEXT	Mariners: LHP James Paxton (3-0, 2.20) makes his sixth start of the season when the teams wrap up their three-game series on Wednesday afternoon. The 25-year-old is unbeaten in nine career starts, with his latest victory last Friday at Detroit when he allowed one run on five hits in six innings. Paxton will be facing the Phillies for the first time.	Phillies: LHP Cole Hamels (6-6, 2.44) will look for some better luck. He has a 1.71 ERA in his last three starts but is 0-1 over that stretch due to a lack of run support that has plagued him all season.	BURNETT DONE?	Burnett signed a one-year deal with a player option for next year in the offseason. After Tuesday's outing, he sounded as if he might decline the option.	Asked if he would return to the Phillies in 2015, Burnett said, "Probably not. We'll see."	REVERE HITLESS	Philadelphia's Ben Revere went without a hit for just the second time in his last nine games, going 0-for-4 with a rare strikeout. Revere entered Tuesday second in the NL in batting at .313 and leading the league in hardest to fan (one strikeout per 11.9 plate appearances).	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

PITTSBURGH -- Justin Upton smashed his 24th home run of the season to spoil Andrew McCutchen's return as the Atlanta Braves beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 11-3 on Tuesday night.	Upton's three-run homer off Francisco Liriano (3-10) in the third broke things open early. He added a two-run single off reliever Brandon Cumpton in the fifth as the Braves extended Pittsburgh's losing streak to a season-high seven games.	Jason Heyward went 2 for 5 with three RBI for the Braves while Evan Gattis hit his 19th homer. Atlanta has won five straight.	Aaron Harang (10-7) struck out four without a walk in 8 1/3 innings.	McCutchen went 0 for 4 in his first game back after missing two weeks with fractured cartilage in his ribs. The reigning National League MVP left the game after grounding into a double play in the bottom of the eighth.	Travis Snider, Starling Marte and Russell Martin had two hits apiece for the Pirates.	The Pirates went 5-9 without their superstar center fielder, who went to the 15-day disabled list retroactive to Aug. 4 after injuring himself while swinging on a routine sacrifice fly against Arizona. He received a standing ovation when he made his first plate appearance but was caught looking at a fastball from Harang that caught the outside corner.	It marked the start of another forgettable night for the Pirates, who matched their longest losing streak since dropping seven in a row from Sept. 7-14, 2012. That skid came in the middle of a late freefall that sent them tumbling out of playoff contention after a promising summer.	While Pittsburgh is slipping, the Braves are surging behind Upton, who is hitting .382 (13 for 34) with four homers during his 10-game hitting streak.	Atlanta already led 1-0 in the third when Liriano -- who came in with a 2.15 ERA since the All-Star break -- allowed singles by Phil Gosselin and Freddie Freeman to start the inning. Upton sent a lined shot over the wall in left to make it 4-0 and the Braves kept piling on.	Heyward drove home B.J. Upton in the fourth and Liriano's control disappeared completely in the fifth. Chris Johnson reached on an error, Gattis singled and Andrelton Simmons walked to load the bases. B.J. Upton singled home Johnson and Heyward plated a pair with a sharp single to right off Cumpton.	Liriano gave up nine runs, seven earned, in four-plus innings. He walked three and struck out four while his ERA rose from 3.78 to 4.18.	It was more than enough support for Harang, whose only real trouble came in the ninth when he failed to get through his first complete game since June 11, 2013 while pitching for the Seattle Mariners.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Braves: After failing to retire a single batter against Charlotte in an International League game on Wednesday night, rehabbing right-handed reliever Shae Simmons will make a third appearance for Triple-A Gwinnett on Wednesday. Simmons, who has been on the disabled list since July 27 with a strained right shoulder, pitched one scoreless inning in his first outing last Saturday against Norfolk.	Pirates: Shortstop Clint Barmes was given a night off in Triple-A Indianapolis as he recovers from a strained left groin that has sidelined him since late June. The 35-year-old Barmes went 0 for 3 in his first game with the Indians on Monday night.	UP NEXT	Braves: Alex Wood (9-9, 3.07 ERA) goes for his third straight victory on Wednesday for Atlanta. The 23-year-old has a 1.45 ERA over his last six starts but remains at .500 on the season because he receives the second-lowest run support in the majors.	Pirates: Ace-in-training Gerrit Cole (7-4, 3.78 ERA) returns from his second stint on the disabled list on Wednesday. Cole hasn't pitched in the majors since being sidelined by right lat soreness on July 9. He pitches seven scoreless innings for Triple-A Indianapolis last Friday. Cole is 4-1 in his last five decisions. He will be making his first career start against Atlanta.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

BOSTON --  Kole Calhoun leaped at the low right-field fence to take a three-run homer away from Brock Holt in the second inning.	"Game-changer," Angels teammate Chris Iannetta said. "It was awesome."	Seven innings later, Iannetta delivered the tiebreaker with an RBI double that sent Los Angeles over the Boston Red Sox 4-3 on Tuesday night.	Brennan Boesch had a ground-rule double with two outs off closer Koji Uehara (5-3) for the Angels' first hit since the fourth. Iannetta then hit the ball off the end of his bat off the left-field wall, just above the leap of Daniel Nava.	But Calhoun's grab in front of his team's bullpen was the major topic in the Angels' clubhouse.	"We go from being potentially down three or four runs to having the opportunity to take the lead," Iannetta said.	Down 1-0 on David Ortiz's 29th homer in the first, the Angels went ahead with three runs in the third.	"This game's a lot about momentum swings," Calhoun said, "and that's a big one right there."	Joe Smith (5-1) got the win for the AL West leaders and Huston Street recorded his 34th save.	Boston rookie center fielder Mookie Betts, a second baseman in the minors, also took away a potential home run when he ran down Josh Hamilton's drive in the first in deep right-center field.	"Every game played in center field is going to be a positive experience for him, given that he's gone through a positional change," Red Sox manager John Farrell said.	The Angels took a 3-1 lead with four consecutive hits, starting with a double by Iannetta. The next three hits all drove in runs -- a single by Calhoun, a triple by Mike Trout and a single by Albert Pujols.	Pujols originally was ruled out for the second out of the inning on Will Middlebrooks' throw after the third baseman's diving backhand stop. The call was overturned on replay, but Trout would have scored anyway on his headfirst slide into home.	Jered Weaver's wildness led to Boston's next two runs that tied it at 3 after six innings.	In the fifth, Dustin Pedroia singled, Ortiz walked and both advanced on a wild pitch. Pedroia scored on Mike Napoli's groundout.	Xander Bogaerts began the sixth with a walk, took third on a single by Christian Vazquez and scored on a sacrifice fly by Holt.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: LHP Joe Thatcher isn't expected to return from the disabled list as hoped by Friday for the start of a three-game series with Oakland. He has been sidelined since Aug. 3 with a sprained left ankle.	Red Sox: Middlebrooks left the game in the fourth with right hamstring tightness. Kelly Johnson pinch-ran after Middlebrooks was hurt while beating out a grounder to shortstop for a single. ... C David Ross is expected to be activated Wednesday after going on the disabled list with right plantar fasciitis.	UP NEXT	Angels: RHP Garrett Richards (13-4, 2.53) pitches in the third game of the series Wednesday night. He won his last three games, including a complete-game shutout against the Los Angeles Dodgers and a 5-4 victory over the Red Sox.	Red Sox: RHP Clay Buchholz (5-7, 5.79) has a 3.00 ERA in his last two starts after a 9.00 ERA in his previous four, a stretch that followed an 11-0 complete-game win over Houston.	WISE WALK	With a runner at second and two outs in the ninth, Street walked Ortiz intentionally then struck out Napoli. "Both guys are going to hit a mistake and Huston didn't make any," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. Ortiz leads the majors with 91 RBIs.	WEB GEM	Red Sox rookie starter Allen Webster pitched six solid innings, retiring his last five batters and allowing runs in just one inning. He's in the regular rotation after Boston traded four starters last month. "I feel pretty confident right now on the mound," he said.	HAMILTON RETURNS	Josh Hamilton went 0 for 3 and was hit by a pitch after sitting out two games following a 10-game stretch in which he went 5 for 38 with 18 strikeouts. He took extra work before the game with hitting coaches Don Baylor and Dave Hansen. "He's going to have to figure it out," Scioscia said. "He's not going to figure it out sitting."	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MIAMI --  Giancarlo Stanton wasn't happy with his fielding error in the seventh inning, which helped the Texas Rangers tie the game.	Stanton wanted to make up for his blunder in right field, but walked the next two at-bats before hitting an RBI single on a 1-2 count with with two outs in the 10th inning and the Miami Marlins beat the Texas Rangers 4-3 Tuesday night for their third straight win.	"I didn't like the sliders that were called so I was already fired up about that, I knew that we were in extra innings because of me so I was already fired up about that, so when I saw (Neftali Feliz) dragging in I was just like, `You put us in this situation, just make sure you're calm and collected and get us out," Stanton said.	Miami (63-62) surpassed last year's total of 62. The Marlins moved over .500 for the first time since June 20.	Jeff Baker reached with one out in the 10th on first baseman Mike Carp's error. Donovan Solano's infield single with two outs moved Baker to second.	Neftali Feliz relieved Neal Cotts (2-7) to face Stanton, who singled to right field.	"We had the right guy there and he had a heck of an at-bat and hit a bullet to right," Marlins manager Mike Redmond said.	Sam Dyson (2-0) struck out the side in the 10th.	Marcell Ozuna hit his 17th home run and Christian Yelich had three hits for the Marlins.	The Rangers scored twice in the seventh to tie it at 3. Rougned Odor opened with a double off the right-field wall and when Stanton misplayed it for an error, Odor circled the bases. Mike Dunn later walked pinch-hitter Daniel Robertson with the bases loaded.	Texas threatened in the ninth with Elvis Andrus on third base and one out, but he got caught off the bag when Robertson pulled back on a potential squeeze bunt.	"The pitch had nothing to do with it," Robertson said. "The manager makes the call-calls a squeeze-you've got to get it down. If you have to dive, dive. If you have to jump, jump. You've got to get it down."	The Rangers were 1 for 10 with runners in scoring position.	"That's what we definitely have to get better on, driving in runs when they're out there," Rangers manager Ron Washington said. "We put ourselves in position but we just don't cash them in."	Marlins starter Jarred Cosart allowed one run and six hits in six innings.	Texas starter Miles Mikolas pitched five innings, allowing three runs and eight hits. He struck out six.	Robinson Chirinos' RBI groundout gave the Rangers a 1-0 lead in the fourth. Ozuna's home run tied it in the bottom half.	The Marlins took a 3-1 lead in the sixth on an RBI single by Jarrod Saltalamacchia and a sacrifice fly by Adeiny Hechavarria.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: Washington was hopeful that RHP Yu Darvish (right shoulder inflammation) would be able to return from the disabled list on Aug. 25, but that appears unlikely as Darvish has not picked up a baseball yet. "I'm backing off," Washington said. "I don't know what's going to happen. I guess we'll just have to wait and see." ... RF Alex Rios was scratched from the starting lineup with a bruised right thumb, but came into the game in the ninth inning.	Marlins: LHP Dan Jennings (concussion) threw one scoreless inning in his first rehab assignment with Gulf Coast League Marlins on Tuesday. "Everything went good so I think the plan for him is to throw a couple innings in his next outing in the next couple of days," Redmond said.	UP NEXT	Miami native Nick Martinez (2-9, 5.27) will start for the Rangers on Wednesday afternoon against Marlins RHP Nathan Eovaldi (6-7, 3.96).	BROKEN BAT	The Marlins' Casey McGehee broke his bat over his right knee after striking out in the bottom of the eighth with two runners left on base.	"I wish I wouldn't have done it," McGehee said. "I was just frustrated. Obviously it was a big spot in the game. I just really wasn't happy with the at-bat I put out there. At the end of the day I've got to be a little bit more grown-up than that."	RETURN TO FLORIDA	Mikolas, who grew up in nearby Jupiter and played at Nova Southeastern University, had a number of friends and family members in attendance.	"It was great, friends and family came out," Mikolas said. "All my coaches and teammates from back at Nova came, my high school coach, my high school teammates. It was fun to know that they were out there.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- The Detroit Tigers found a way to win a wild, long game against Tampa Bay.	Victor Martinez drew a tiebreaking bases-loaded walk during a three-run 11th inning, and the Tigers beat the Rays 8-6 on Tuesday night.	Ian Kinsler opened the 11th with a triple off Grant Balfour (1-5), a flare to right that got past a diving Kevin Kiermaier. Torii Hunter walked and Miguel Cabrera was intentionally walked before Martinez got his free pass.	"We did what we had to do," Hunter said. "Had good at-bats, and we came through with some runs."	Hunter scored on Jeff Beliveau's wild pitch, and Bryan Holaday added a sacrifice fly that gave Detroit an 8-5 lead.	Jim Johnson (5-2) worked out of a two-on, two-out jam in the 10th. Joe Nathan gave up Evan Longoria's RBI single in the 11th before getting his 26th save.	The Tigers, second in the American League wild-card chase, won for the fifth time in 13 games.	The game took 4 hours, 42 minutes.	James Loney homered for the Rays, who had a club-record stretch of 13 consecutive games holding opponents to four runs or fewer end.	Detroit starter Max Scherzer came up short in his bid to become the AL's first 15-game winner when Joba Chamberlain gave up an eighth-inning sacrifice fly to Vince Belnome that tied it at 5.	Scherzer allowed four runs and four hits over seven innings. The right-hander held Tampa Bay scoreless on one hit over his final five innings.	"Both Max and the offense picked it up as the game went on," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.	J.D. Martinez hit a solo homer that put the Tigers up 5-4 in the eighth. Rajai Davis had a sixth-inning game-tying RBI single off Chris Archer, who gave up four runs and five hits in 5 2/3 innings.	The Tigers pulled within 4-3 in the fifth, thanks in part to a video review. After Kinsler walked with the bases loaded and Hunter hit a run-scoring grounder, Cabrera was given an RBI single following a challenge by Ausmus. The call that center fielder Desmond Jennings had made a sliding catch on Cabrera's two-out liner was overturned.	Loney's homer put the Rays up 3-0 in the first.	Belnome doubled for his first big league hit and scored to make it 4-0 on Zobrist's second-inning single. Belnome had what would have been his first homer in the fourth changed to a foul after a video review.	"We got burned on replay twice but they were the right calls," Rays manager Joe Maddon said. "Had replay not been part of the game, we would have won that game tonight."	Scherzer had allowed three runs or fewer in each of his previous 10 starts.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: Right-hander Justin Verlander (sore right shoulder) could throw off a mound in a couple of days and might start Saturday. Outfielder Andy Dirks (back surgery) injured a hamstring at Triple-A Toledo and could miss the rest of the season.	Rays: Outfielder Wil Myers (broken right wrist) is expected back this week. Catcher Ryan Hanigan (oblique) and outfielder David DeJesus (broken left hand) are nearing rehab assignments.	UP NEXT	Tigers RHP Rick Porcello (13-7) and Rays RHP Jake Odorizzi (9-9) are Wednesday night's scheduled starters.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CHICAGO -- This gives new meaning to a win that was a long time coming for the Chicago Cubs.	After two days, the first upheld protest in nearly 30 years and another rainstorm, the Cubs finally completed a 2-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants in a suspended game Thursday night.	Including delays -- 1 hour, 57 minutes Thursday -- the game lasted 9:21.	"It was an interesting day today," Cubs manager Rick Renteria said. "We got more weather."	Anthony Rizzo's two-run homer from Tuesday held up as the teams played the final 4 1/2 innings of a game the Cubs thought they had won 2-0 before Major League Baseball ruled it was suspended.	In the middle of the fifth inning Tuesday, a short rainstorm caused a delay of more than 4 1/2 hours after the grounds crew couldn't put the tarp down quickly. The umpires said the field was unplayable and called it at 1:16 a.m. local time.	But the Giants protested, and MLB ruled that the tarp had not been properly put away after its previous use. The game was ruled suspended.	Then it rained some more Thursday.	Giants manager Bruce Bochy, who expressed his frustration Tuesday, was satisfied with how the game played out.	"It was a little bit of a strange one with the suspended game today," said Bochy, who added, "You know, they got it right."	It was the first successful protest in MLB since 1986.	For the Cubs, who supported the Giants' protest, it felt good to win without grounds crew assistance.	"I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you that we wanted to close it out," Renteria said. "Everyone did everything possible to get it in. "	Joe Panik had an RBI single in the sixth to pull the Giants to 2-1, but they were unable to scratch another run across against the Cubs' bullpen.	Tuesday's starters proved to be the pitchers of record. Tsuyoshi Wada (3-1) earned the victory for the Cubs, while Ryan Vogelsong (7-9) took the loss.	Hector Rondon worked a scoreless ninth for his 19th save in 23 opportunities, putting runners on first and second before ending it by stopping Angel Pagan's comebacker with his foot.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: Right-hander Edwin Jackson was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a right lat strain. Jackson dealt with a similar injury at the end of last season and hopes that by going on the DL now, he will be able to pitch again in September. ... Shortstop Starlin Castro was placed on the bereavement list after leaving the team for a family emergency. Bereavement list rules require a minimum stay of three days and a maximum stay of one week.	Giants: Infielder Ehire Adrianza has been slow to recover from a second strained groin injury, which raises doubts about his status in the final weeks of the season. "He's not ready yet, so that's another decision we'll have to make," Bochy said. ... Bochy was optimistic that first baseman Brandon Belt and catcher Hector Sanchez would recover from concussions in time for the stretch drive.	UP NEXT	Following the completion of the suspended game, the Cubs and Giants finished their three-game series. Left-hander Travis Wood (7-10, 4.86 ERA) took the hill for Chicago against Madison Bumgarner (13-9, 3.14) in a 5-3 Giants win. The Giants now head to Washington for a weekend series with the Nationals, while the Cubs stay home to host the Baltimore Orioles.	FRIENDLY GESTURE	Bochy expressed gratitude to Cubs officials for their attempts to play the game in its entirety. Chicago's support might have played a role in the Giants' successful protest. "I don't know for a fact, but I think so because they were for finishing the game today," Bochy said. "I give my compliments to (president) Theo (Epstein) and their organization."	KONTOS GETS THE CALL	Earlier Thursday, the Giants recalled relief pitcher George Kontos from Triple-A Fresno to serve as the 26th man in the regularly scheduled game. He will return to the farm club after the game.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MILWAUKEE --  Fresh off another stellar outing, Mike Fiers first wanted to talk about a rough patch early in the game and offer credit to his defense.	"I think early on I was a little erratic around the strike zone and then I pulled it together later on," said Fiers, who won his third consecutive start since being recalled from Triple-A Nashville on Aug. 9 as the Milwaukee Brewers defeated the Toronto Blue Jays 6-1 Tuesday. "My defense came through. There were a lot of great plays."	Fiers (3-1) was plenty spectacular himself, holding the Blue Jays to two hits and one run over seven innings. He retired the final 18 batters he faced in a 106-pitch outing.	After throwing 44 pitches through two innings, Fiers took control of the game.	"I wanted to be aggressive in the strike zone and make them swing the bat," he said.	Fiers, who struck out six and walked one, left the field to a standing ovation, waving briefly to the sellout crowd.	"I feel like I can pitch this way and compete well at this level," he said.	Jonathan Lucroy and Aramis Ramirez each had a pair of doubles for Milwaukee, which won its fifth consecutive game.	"I didn't expect anything less the way he's been pitching," Lucroy said of Fiers' performance.  "He's throwing strikes, working ahead, executing."	Fiers has given up two runs over his three starts.	The Brewers jumped on Toronto starter J.A. Happ (8-8) immediately, belting three doubles to take a 2-0 lead in the first inning.	The Blue Jays, who have lost six of seven, got on the board in the second on Munenori Kawasaki's RBI ground out.	The Brewers added two doubles in the third to extend their lead to 4-1. Milwaukee hitters connected for another pair of doubles in the fifth and added two more runs.	Happ lasted just 3 1/3 innings, giving up six hits and four runs. It marked his shortest start since going just 2 1/3 innings against the Los Angeles Angels on May 10.	DOUBLE TROUBLE:	The Brewers set a season high with seven doubles. The team single-game record is nine, accomplished four times. Lucroy's two doubles brought his season total to 42.	"I got a couple mistakes up in the zone and I was able to take advantage," Lucroy said.	No primary catcher has ever led his league in doubles for a season. Lucroy, who played first base in Tuesday's game, has 35 doubles as a catcher, six as a first baseman and one as a designated hitter.	"Luc always has good at-bats," Milwaukee manager Ron Roenicke said.	The major league record for doubles by a catcher in a season is 45 by the Rangers' Ivan Rodriguez in 1996.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: RHP Jim Henderson, on the disabled list since May, had right shoulder surgery on Tuesday, ending his season. .RHP Matt Garza, on the 15-day DL with an oblique strain, could return to the rotation in early September, and RHP Kyle Lohse, who is nursing a sore ankle, won't pitch during the five-game home stand, manager Ron Roenicke said.	Blue Jays: Edwin Encarnacion, who was activated on Friday after missing more than a month with a quad injury, started at first base. He started the previous three games at DH, not an option in the National League ballpark. "We need him," manager John Gibbons said.	ON DECK	Brewers: Rookie Jimmy Nelson (2-3. 3.86 ERA) has five consecutive quality starts and has been counted on heavily with injuries to Garza and	Lohse. The Brewers are 4-3 in Nelson's seven starts.	Blue Jays: R.A. Dickey (9-12. 3.95) will pitch the finale in the two-game series. Dickey's nine losses on the road are tied for the most in the majors.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MINNEAPOLIS -- Tyler Holt arrived at Target Field 25 minutes before the first pitch. The Cleveland Indians' rookie had a quick bite to eat, took a few swings in the batting cage and then got the biggest hit of his young career.	Yan Gomes had three hits including a home run, Holt hit a go-ahead two-run double in the sixth inning, and Cleveland rallied to beat the Minnesota Twins 7-5 on Tuesday night.	Holt thought he might enter the game in the seventh or eighth inning. Instead, Indians bench coach Brad Mills fetched Holt from the batting cage in the sixth and told him he was pinch-hitting for Chris Dickerson.	"I didn't have any time to think or get ready," said Holt, now on his fourth stint with Cleveland this season. "I just threw on some gloves. Luckily, I didn't have time to think. I'd probably strike out or something."	With two outs in the sixth, Holt doubled home Gomes and Lonnie Chisenhall for his first two career RBIs. The line drive to right-center came off reliever Brian Duensing (3-3) and gave the Indians a 6-5 lead.	Michael Bourn singled home Holt to make it a two-run game.	Oswaldo Arcia homered in his third straight game for Minnesota, capping a five-run first where Joe Mauer and Kennys Vargas also drove in runs.	However, Indians starter Trevor Bauer settled down and retired the next 14 batters before coming out for Kyle Crockett (3-0), who got the final out in the fifth and one in the sixth.	Cody Allen -- the last of seven Indians relievers to appear in the game -- pitched the ninth for his 16th save in 17 chances.	Gomes homered in the second and Zach Walters' two-run single cut Minnesota's lead to 5-3 in the fourth.	Arcia's three-run homer was his fifth in his last seven games and 13th this season, one shy of his 2013 rookie total.	Minnesota starter Kyle Gibson allowed five runs in 5 1/3 innings and bounced a two-out, two-strike wild pitch in the fifth that allowed Bourn to score and make it 5-4.	"I don't know if I just wasn't as aggressive or what, but I definitely didn't do a very good job of pitching with the lead tonight," Gibson said.	Adding to Holt's chaotic day, his cab driver from the airport didn't know how to get to Target Field.	"These guys battle until the 27th out," Holt said about the Indians, winners of six of their last eight. "It's not a surprise that they came back. Luckily I got the opportunity to come through."	BULLPEN STEPS UP	Indians manager Terry Francona was playing matchups with the steady stream of relievers who managed to hold Minnesota scoreless. The bullpen looked at it as a challenge to come up big after the offense rallied.	"We thrive off of that," Allen said. "The offense gave us a chance to get back in the game and then we had to come through."	TRAINER's ROOM	Indians: 1B Nick Swisher had his injured right knee examined by a specialist in California, and Francona said the team would provide an update on his condition Wednesday. Also, the Indians placed OF Ryan Raburn on the DL before the game, recalling OF Holt from Triple-A Columbus to take his place. Raburn has been bothered all season by a sore right wrist that he aggravated last week while making a diving catch. The decision was made after Raburn took early batting practice.	"You know what, man?" Francona said he told him. "Let's calm this thing down." The manager hoped Raburn could start a rehab assignment before he's eligible to be activated.	Twins: General manager Terry Ryan ruled out a return this year for RHP Mike Pelfrey, who has been out since making his fifth start in early May, first because of a groin problem and then an elbow injury that required surgery. Pelfrey has resumed playing catch, but time is running out on the season.	"We'll start him fresh next year and he'll be a piece of spring training, but I don't see any reason why we ought to push that." Pelfrey is under contract for $5.5 million in 2015, but the competition for rotation spots will be crowded.	UP NEXT:	TWINS: Ricky Nolasco (5-8) starts the second game of this three-game series on Wednesday and will be looking for his first win since July 1.	INDIANS: TJ House (1-3) has allowed three or fewer earned runs in eight straight starts and nine of his first 12. The Indians will try to climb three games above .500 for the first time since July 19.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ST. LOUIS -- The St. Louis Cardinals are finding new ways to get walk-off wins.	Jon Jay was hit by a pitch from J.J. Hoover with the bases-loaded in the ninth inning, lifting the Cardinals to a 5-4 win over the Cincinnati Reds on Tuesday night.	The walk-off victory was the second in two nights for the Cardinals, who won for the fifth time in six games and remained 2 1/2 games behind Milwaukee in the NL Central.	Jhonny Peralta's RBI single in the 10th inning Monday provided St. Louis with a thrilling last-at-bat triumph.	Matt Holliday drew a leadoff walk to start Tuesday's winning rally. He advanced to third on Matt Adams' single. After Peter Bourjos ran for Holliday, Peralta walked to load the bases. Hoover (1-10) then plunked Jay to force in Bourjos with the winning run.	"It's not like you hope to get hit by a pitch every time," Jay said. "But I'll take it."	St. Louis got its sixth walk-off win of the season. The Cardinals also posted consecutive wins in such fashion July 7-8 against Pittsburgh.	The Reds lost in walk-off fashion for the third time in the last four games. They are a season-high 10 games out of first place.	"(Two walk-offs) in a row isn't fun," Cincinnati third baseman Todd Frazier said. "It's crazy, I've never been around something like that. I never want to see it again."	Jay scored the tying run in the eighth on pinch-hitter Daniel Descalso's RBI double off reliever Jumbo Diaz.	"Call it whatever you want to call it, but we're just playing better baseball right now," Descalso said. "We've got down the last couple nights and we've come back. That's always a good sign."	Reliever Pat Neshek (6-0) pitched a scoreless ninth inning.	Frazier put the Reds in front 2-1, with a two-run homer in the fourth. It was his 21st home run of the season, but first since July 20.	Cincinnati starter Alfredo Simon gave up three runs and eight hits over 5 1/3 innings. He struck out two and walked one.	St. Louis starter John Lackey gave up four runs, two earned, in six innings. He struck out seven and walked one.	Cincinnati scored twice in the sixth on a bases-loaded double by former Cardinals outfielder Ryan Ludwick. Errors by Holliday and Matt Carpenter and a walk set the stage for Ludwick's hit, which pushed the lead to 4-1.	But the Reds' taxed bullpen was unable to hold the lead.	"Short starts have bit us on the tail this road trip," Cincinnati manager Bryan Price said. "It blows up the bullpen."	Peralta homered in the sixth to cut the deficit to 4-2. It was Peralta's 17th home run of the season, setting the single-season mark for a St. Louis shortstop. Jay and Oscar Taveras followed with hits before pinch-hitter Shane Robinson singled off reliever Sam LeCure to bring the Cardinals to 4-3.	"I feel like the last two nights have felt like playoff games," Adams said.	St. Louis took a 1-0 lead on a run-scoring single by Holliday in the third.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: Closer Aroldis Chapman was unavailable Tuesday for the second night in a row with what manager Bryan Price called an, "achy," shoulder. The reliever is listed as day to day by the Reds training staff. Chapman has 26 saves in 28 chances. He walked four successive batters on Sunday in Colorado.	Cardinals: INF Mark Ellis was put on the 15-day disabled list with a left oblique strain. Ellis, who is hitting .192 with 12 RBI, last played on Tuesday. INF Greg Garcia was recalled from Triple-A Memphis in time for Tuesday's contest. Garcia was hitting .273 with 40 RBI in 103 games for the Redbirds.	JAY KEEPS ROLLING	Jay extended his hitting streak to 11 games with a single in the second, the first of two hits. He is 15 for 31 during the run and reached base four times Tuesday.	UP NEXT	Reds: RHP Johnny Cueto (15-6, 2.06) will start the final game of the three-game set. Cueto is 7-0 with a 2.24 ERA over his last eight starts. His seven-game winning streak is a career high.	Cardinals: RHP Lance Lynn (13-8, 2.91) will make his team-leading 26th start of the season. He is 5-1 lifetime against the Reds	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DENVER --  Ned Yost never has a bad birthday, but a win helps make the occasion much more special.	Omar Infante had three doubles and drove in four runs to help the streaking Kansas City Royals beat the Colorado Rockies 7-4 on Tuesday night.	It also brought a smile to Yost, who turned 60.	"For 35 years I've always thought I've been a winner on every one of my birthdays because I'm with a group of guys I really like and have fun being around," he said. "But when you win the game it makes it that much more sweeter."	The Royals have been celebrating a lot lately. Since dropping two games below .500 on July 21 they have won 22 of 27 to move two games ahead of Detroit in the AL Central.	They even won with ace James Shields not having his best stuff.	"It was a grind day. It was one of those days where I didn't have my good stuff at all," he said. "You're going to go through days like that and you battle through it."	Shields pitched six solid innings to get the win for the Royals, who are a major league best 15-4 in interleague play.	It took a while but they did get to Colorado rookie Tyler Matzek in the seventh.	Matzek (2-9) came into Tuesday with a 9.60 ERA in August but was having his best outing since blanking Pittsburgh over seven innings on July 26 when he ran into trouble with two outs in the seventh. Matzek got the first two outs before allowing a pinch-hit single to Josh Willingham and walking Nori Aoki.	Adam Ottavino came on and gave up consecutive doubles to Infante and Salvador Perez to give the Royals a 4-2 lead.	"It was a great at-bat. Ottavino was throwing hard, good slider," Billy Butler said. "It woke me up. He had good stuff and Omar stepped up."	The Royals scored three more runs in the eighth off Colorado's bullpen. Infante had a two-run double with the bases loaded.	It was the second time in his career he has had three doubles in a game. The last time, May 27, 2004, came against the Royals when he was playing for Detroit.	"Omar's swing is so simple, it's not a lot of moving parts," Yost said. "He can get on a streak in a hurry."	That made a winner of Shields (12-6), who allowed two runs on nine hits and struck out six. He wasn't sharp, allowing base runners in every inning but his last and struck out Drew Stubbs with the bases loaded to end the fourth.	Stubbs and Nolan Arenado each had three hits and a home run for Colorado.	Arenado went deep in the fifth to give Colorado a 2-1 lead and Stubbs hit a two-run homer in the ninth, when the Rockies mounted a rally. Greg Holland came on and threw one pitch to record his 39th save in 40 chances.	"They get a lead after six innings, they pretty much wipe you out," Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. "That's been the formula for them this year. Guys come in throwing in the upper 90s and throwing strikes."	Justin Morneau, back in the lineup after missing two games with a stiff neck, gave Colorado a 1-0 lead with a double-play grounder in the first.	Kansas City tied it in the fourth on Lorenzo Cain's RBI double.	BIRTHDAY BOY	Yost was starting his postgame news conference when first base coach Rusty Kuntz interrupted to present the manager with a cake. Kuntz then sang "Happy Birthday" and gave Yost a hug before leaving his office.	DOUBLE TROUBLE	Infante wasn't the only Royals player to record a two-bagger. Kansas City had six doubles for the first time since July 29, 2011, at Cleveland.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals: Perez returned to the lineup after being pulled from Monday's game with a sore knee.	Rockies: OF Michael Cuddyer was scratched from the lineup with a sore left hamstring. Manager Walt Weiss said it wasn't a long-term issue, adding that playing a doubleheader Sunday led to the soreness. Cuddyer hit for the cycle in the second game of the Rockies' sweep.	UP NEXT	Royals: Red-hot Kansas City will go for a season sweep of the Rockies with lefty Danny Duffy on the mound. Duffy (8-10) has won a career-high three straight starts.	Rockies: Colorado's lone bright spot on the mound, LHP Jorge De La Rosa, will face his former team Wednesday. De La Rosa (12-8) made 33 starts for the Royals in 2006-07 before joining the Rockies. He has accounted for nearly a quarter of Colorado's 49 wins this season.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- Oakland Athletics leadoff hitter Coco Crisp tinkered with his swing for a few days and finally got the results he had been looking for.	That is critical for a team trying to hang on in the American League West after owning the best record in baseball for a majority of the season.	Crisp hit a tiebreaking three-run triple in the fourth inning to help Scott Kazmir earn his career-best 14th win, and the A's beat the New York Mets 6-2 on Tuesday night to snap a five-game losing streak.	"I haven't been hitting well at all so I'm trying to figure out some things to try to be successful with whatever I'm dealing with," Crisp said. "These past couple of days, whatever I've been trying to do, it seems like it could work so I'm trying to stick with that and see what happens."	Crisp wouldn't divulge what changes he has made to his swing but it is clear he knew something had to change.	Coming off a miserable road trip during which he went 2-for-23, Crisp grounded out and singled before lining an 0-1 pitch from Mets starter Dillon Gee down the right-field line with the bases loaded. It was Crisp's third triple this season.	The A's, who avoided losing six consecutive games for the first time since 2012, remained a half-game behind the Los Angeles Angels in the AL West.	"It's very rare that he goes through a stretch like that," Oakland manager Bob Melvin said of Crisp. "It's not like he was striking out all the time (or) taking off-balance swings. A hit like that, especially with runners in scoring position in a tight game, can do wonders for the personality."	Kazmir (14-5) allowed one run and four hits in six innings. He retired nine of his final 10 batters after giving up a solo home run to Travis d'Arnaud leading off the fourth.	New York lost its third straight.	Oakland had been mired in a team-wide hitting slump before coming up with its most productive game in a week.	Crisp, who has been in and out of the lineup with lingering neck pain, provided the biggest boost with his first multihit game since July 8.	Josh Reddick added a two-run homer, and Alberto Callaspo drove in a run with a sacrifice fly two batters before Crisp's bases-clearing hit.	The Mets avoided making history but couldn't snap their skid.	New York had been held to four hits or fewer in its previous five games. According to stats provided to the team by Elias Sports Bureau, no club had ever done that in six straight.	The Mets managed seven hits this time but it wasn't enough to prevent their second loss in three games against the A's this season.	Gee (4-6) gave up four runs and eight hits in 5 2/3 innings. The right-hander fell to 0-5 in his past seven starts and is winless since July 9.	"He was up in the zone," Mets manager Terry Collins said. "That's not where he's supposed to be. The balls Coco hit were because he fell behind in the count. He's a better pitcher than he's showing."	WORLD SERIES REDUX	This was just the Mets' second visit to Oakland since the teams played in the 1973 World Series. New York lost two of three games at the Coliseum in 2005.	ON FIRE	D'Arnaud's home run was his fourth in 12 games. In 43 games since being brought up from Triple-A on June 24, he is batting .267 with eight homers, 10 doubles, 22 RBIs and 10 runs scored.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: As expected, New York placed RHP Bartolo Colon on the bereavement list following the death of his mother. Right-hander Gonzalez Germen was recalled from Triple-A Las Vegas to take Colon's roster spot. ... Right-hander Jacob deGrom pitched to hitters and is on schedule to come off the DL on Friday. ... Second baseman Daniel Murphy was given the night off. Murphy went into the day leading the National League with 152 hits.	Athletics: Infielder Nick Punto (hamstring) will begin to do more baseball activities in the coming days. ... Outfielder Craig Gentry (hand) was slated to play seven innings for Triple-A Sacramento. Kyle Blanks (calf strain) was penciled in at DH.	UP NEXT	Mets: RHP Zack Wheeler (8-8) makes his second career start against Oakland. Wheeler allowed six runs and lasted just two innings in his only other outing against the A's on June 25, the shortest start of his career.	Athletics: RHP Jeff Samardzija (3-2) pitches the second half of this two-game series. He is unbeaten in five starts at the Coliseum.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

LOS ANGELES -- A month after coming off the disabled list, Carl Crawford is on a tear.	He homered for the first time since May 23 and tied his season high with three RBIs in helping the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the San Diego Padres 8-6 on Tuesday night, avoiding a four-game losing streak.	Justin Turner drove in two runs and scored another pair for the Dodgers, who have won six of their last seven against the Padres while improving to 8-3 against their NL West rival this season.	Crawford hit a two-run shot with two outs in the seventh, just his fifth homer of the season. He is batting .420 since Aug. 4 after spending 1 1/2 months on the DL with a sprained left ankle.	"Things are starting to get better for me," he said. "Hopefully some more (home runs) will come."	After getting swept in three games by Milwaukee and taking Monday off, the Dodgers had a team meeting before the game to talk about their skid.	"We wanted to get back on track again," Crawford said. "That day off was big. A lot of guys said they felt good today."	Former Padre Kevin Correia (2-0) allowed four runs and eight hits over five innings in his Dodger Stadium debut, falling behind 3-0 on Jedd Gyorko's three-run homer in the first. The right-hander struck out six and walked one while making his second start since being acquired from Minnesota on Aug. 9. He replaced Hyun-Jin Ryu, who is on the disabled list.	"Not the way you want to start but it's just one pitch," Correia said. "I was making some pretty close pitches early and just wasn't getting the call. I've pitched here so many times I felt good right away."	Kenley Jansen pitched the ninth for his 35th save, although his throwing error on a bunt single led to a run.	On the final play of the game, Padres manager Bud Black challenged a call that ruled Abraham Almonte out at third on a tag play. Yasiel Puig hit Adrian Gonzalez with the cutoff throw to keep the tying run at first and Gonzalez fired to third as Almonte was diving back to the bag.	"He plays an aggressive style of baseball," Black said. "That play worked out for Puig."	Turner's RBI double to deep center field in the fourth inning scored Matt Kemp, who doubled leading off, and tied the game 3-all. A.J. Ellis' sacrifice fly gave the Dodgers their first lead of the game, 4-3. Correia grounded into a fielder's choice to the catcher, and Turner scored on a throwing error by first baseman Jake Goebbert to make it 5-3.	Goebbert's throw bounced and got past Yangervis Solarte, who became entangled with Turner on the bag. When Solarte chased after the errant throw, Turner ran toward the plate with his red hair flying and scored.	Los Angeles cut the lead to 3-2 in the second on Turner's first RBI double and Erisbel Arruebarrena's RBI single.	Ian Kennedy (9-11) gave up six runs -- five earned -- and seven hits in five innings. He struck out five and walked two.	DODGERS MOVES	The team recalled Arruebarrena from Triple-A Albuquerque and he started at shortstop with Hanley Ramirez on the DL. Arruebarrena most recently played in three rehab games for the Rookie-level AZL Dodgers while recovering from right shoulder soreness, going 4-for-11 with two doubles, two homers and four RBIs. He has batted .333 with 11 RBI in 26 games with the Isotopes this season. Infielder Carlos Triunfel was sent back down to Albuquerque, where he came from last weekend.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: Pitcher Andrew Cashner (right shoulder soreness) will be reinstated from the disabled list this weekend and return to the rotation. The right-hander is 2-6 with a 2.36 ERA in 12 starts.	Dodgers: Infielder Juan Uribe, on the disabled list with a hamstring injury, is feeling better and will work indoors for a couple of days. Pitcher Josh Beckett, on the DL with a torn labrum, will let his muscle heal before he starts a throwing program to see if can handle it. Manager Don Mattingly says the question is whether or not there's enough time remaining for Beckett to get back up to speed before the season ends. Ryu is throwing, but has not yet been cleared to resume running while he deals with a right hip strain.	ON DECK	Padres: Left-hander Eric Stults (5-13, 4.64 ERA) takes the mound. He has limited the opposition to a .222 batting average over his last 10 starts since June 17 at Seattle.	Dodgers: Roberto Hernandez (7-8, 3.72 ERA) has faced the Padres once in his career on May 12, 2013, when he was with Tampa Bay. He is 3-5 in 12 career starts against the NL West.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MIAMI --  Nick Martinez enjoyed his homecoming. And, after an anxious ninth inning, his friends and family got to celebrate a win.	Martinez allowed two runs and struck out a career-high seven in six innings of work, Alex Rios drove in two runs and the Texas Rangers survived Miami's last-inning rally to beat the Marlins 5-4 on Wednesday afternoon.	Marcell Ozuna and Jarrod Saltalamacchia homered in the ninth for Miami, but the Rangers held on for a split of the quick two-game series.	"It was great," said Martinez, who had about 100 family and friends in the stands. "It was very special. I got to pitch where it all started against a team I grew up watching. I thought that was pretty cool and even better than we came out on top."	Martinez (3-9) allowed six hits and threw 62 of 96 pitches for strikes. He was born in nearby Hialeah and pitched at Belen Jesuit Prep, about 12 miles from Marlins Park.	Leonys Martin had three hits for Texas, which grabbed a 5-0 lead after two innings. And after giving up the two solo homers, Neftali Feliz got his fifth save in six tries, striking out Donovan Solano to end the game with the tying run on base.	Feliz closed it out moments after manager Ron Washington visited the mound and nearly pulled him.	"He said, `Give me one more hitter' and he said it like he meant it," Washington said. "So I gave him one more hitter."	Marlins starter Nathan Eovaldi (6-8) gave up nine hits and five runs, four earned, in five innings.	Martinez had a 3-0 lead before taking the mound in his home city for the first time. Texas -- which had been held to three runs or less in 14 of its last 18 games entering Wednesday -- strung together four straight two-out hits in the opening inning. J.P. Arencibia's double brought Rios home with the first run, and Adrian Beltre came around when Marlins shortstop Adeiny Hechavarria dropped the relay.	Martin's single made it 3-0, and Rios' second-inning double -- on a popup that dropped in right -- pushed the lead to 5-0.	"I was leaving the fastball up in the zone, couldn't get that slider to have that good bite to it," Eovaldi said. "It's tough for us to come back from 5-0 after two innings but we were right there, knocking on the door at the end."	Martinez gave up an RBI double to Ozuna in the fourth, then let Ozuna score Miami's second run on a wild pitch. Otherwise, he largely escaped trouble.	Ozuna and Christian Yelich each had three hits for Miami.	"Too many runs early," Marlins manager Mike Redmond said. "It's a day game, 12:40 start, we've got to come out of the chute and put up some zeroes, give our offense a chance to get going. To give up five runs in two innings, that can't happen."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: In his fifth rehab outing, LHP Derek Holland (microfracture surgery on left knee) gave up seven hits and two earned runs in five-plus innings for Triple-A Round Rock against Tacoma on Tuesday night, earning the win. The Rangers still lead big league teams with 14 players on the DL.	Marlins: The Marlins hope to get reliever Dan Jennings back in the coming weeks, and the bullpen will get a boost in the interim. LHP Brad Hand starts Sunday, meaning RHP Brad Penny is eligible for relief work.	UP NEXT	Rangers: Texas is off Thursday. RHP Colby Lewis (8-10, 5.52) gets the ball for the Rangers on Friday night when they open a weekend homestand against Kansas City and Royals right-hander Yordano Ventura (9-9, 3.48). It'll be the first meeting between the clubs in 2014.	Marlins: Following a day off Thursday, the Marlins open a nine-game road trip when RHP Henderson Alvarez (9-5, 2.43) starts Friday at Colorado. LHP Franklin Morales (5-6, 5.04) is the scheduled starter for the Rockies.	HOME LETDOWN	The Marlins' three-game home winning streak was snapped. Miami hasn't won four straight at home since May 4-7.	SIZZLING MARTIN	Martin is batting .500 (15-30) in his last eight games for Texas, including five multi-hit games.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PHILADELPHIA --  In a change of recent fortune, luck was on Cole Hamels' side this time.	Wil Nieves doubled and had three hits and Hamels got a victory when he wasn't at his best as the Philadelphia Phillies defeated the Seattle Mariners 4-3 on Wednesday.	Chase Utley had the go-ahead RBI and Ben Revere and Marlon Byrd drove in runs for the Phillies, who won for just the third time in their last nine.	Kendrys Morales homered for Seattle, which was bidding to move 12 games over .500 for the first time since 2007. The Mariners, who are battling Detroit for the AL's second wild-card spot, lost for just the third time in 10 games.	Hamels (7-6) snapped his string of seven straight starts going at least seven innings, but picked up the win in a rare reversal of fortunes. The left-hander entered Wednesday with the eight-best ERA in baseball but there were more than 100 pitchers with more victories. Hamels didn't have his best stuff against the Mariners, giving up three runs on nine hits with four strikeouts, one walk and two wild pitches, but he got just enough run support and a lift from the Philadelphia bullpen.	"He's pitched outstanding," Phillies manager Ryne Sandberg said. "He was due for a win like this with not his best stuff and his teammates picking him up. He's on a long roll of good games and some of them without the run support. He was due for one today."	Hamels said: "I think the team definitely played really well with getting the runs in when we needed to."	Jonathan Papelbon struck out two in a scoreless ninth for his 30th save in 33 opportunities. Jake Diekman followed Hamels and struck out four in two scoreless frames and Ken Giles fanned the side in the scoreless eighth.	James Paxton (3-1) took the first loss of his career after the shortest outing in his 10th start. He lasted four innings while allowing four runs -- one earned -- on seven hits. The 25-year-old Paxton was 6-0 in his career.	"I probably could've executed pitches a little bit better," Paxton said. "But they were finding holes with ground balls, a couple bloopers in there, but that's baseball."	Philadelphia was helped by Paxton in the fourth. After Nieves led off with a single, Andres Blanco hit a liner off Paxton's left ankle. The pitcher retrieved the ball but threw it away to put runners on second and third with no outs. Nieves scored on a passed ball and Utley's RBI single made it 4-3.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: Paxton stayed in the game after taking Blanco's line drive off his left foot in the fourth inning. He said afterward he was OK.	Phillies: OF John Mayberry Jr. had a pair of hits on Tuesday in his first rehab game with Triple-A Lehigh Valley at Pawtucket. Mayberry has been on the DL since July 21 with left wrist inflammation.	UP NEXT	Mariners: Seattle takes Thursday off before heading to Boston for a three-game series at Fenway Park beginning at 4:10 Friday afternoon. Felix Hernandez (13-4, 1.99) takes the hill for the Mariners for the first time since snapping his MLB record of 16 straight starts with seven or more innings and two runs or fewer.	Phillies: Following Thursday's off day, RHP Kyle Kendrick (5-11, 4.90) takes the mound as Philadelphia opens a three-game home series with the Cardinals at 7:05 Friday. Kendrick is 1/3 with a 5.49 ERA in his last seven starts. Following his last start, Kendrick apologized a day after storming off the mound and not waiting for manager Ryne Sandberg when he was lifted after allowing three earned runs in five innings of a 6-5 loss to the Giants on Saturday.	SUPPORT FOR TANEY	Sandberg replaced his customary Phillies uniform and cap with one bearing the name of Taney at his postgame news conference and pledged the team's support for the Philadelphia team in the Little League World Series.	"We all played Little League so we can relate," Sandberg said. "It's back to the basics of having fun and jumping around and doing all of the things they do. To have someone to cheer for and pull for, that doesn't happen every year. We have somebody to pull for."	STREAK SNAPPED	The Mariners had their streak of 15 straight wins when scoring three or more runs snapped.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MILWAUKEE --  The Toronto Blue Jays are heading home with a sense of relief.	Outslugging one of the best teams in the National League can ease the sting of a 2-6 road trip.	Jose Bautista's three-run homer capped a five-run sixth inning and Toronto snapped the Milwaukee Brewers' five-game winning streak with a 9-5 victory Wednesday.	It's time to start chipping away again in the AL East after falling a season-high nine games out of first entering the day.	"This has not been a good road trip for us, anybody will tell you that," starter R.A. Dickey said. "The home run by Jose was the difference and you could kind of hear a collective sigh on the bench."	Bautista hit a 1-2 pitch from reliever Brandon Kintzler into the Brewers' bullpen in right field, scattering pitchers from their seats. The two-out homer made a winner of Dickey (10-12), who gave up five runs in 5 2/3 choppy innings.	"In reality, that's baseball. You go through these stretches," manager John Gibbons. "It doesn't take much just to miss a ball."	Dickey left after Carlos Gomez's two-run homer in the bottom of the sixth made it 7-5. The bullpen held on from there, and Toronto got some extra cushion after Colby Rasmus hit a two-run homer, his 16th of the year, in the ninth.	The Blue Jays outhit the NL Central leaders 15-10.	Brewers manager Ron Roenicke pointed back to the sixth as a turning point.	"So tough inning, you know we come back and Gomey gets the two points and we get a little closer, and we give up another homer. So we just didn't pitch that well today," he said. "Offensively I thought it was really good day."	LEARNING ON THE JOB	Rookie Jimmy Nelson (2-4) took the loss after allowing the first two runners to reach in the sixth. Facing a former Cy Young Award winner for the fourth straight start, Nelson gave up four runs and nine hits in 5 2/3 innings.	Roenicke said he thought Nelson threw the ball well, and credited the table-setters in Toronto's order, Jose Reyes and Melky Cabrera, with hitting good pitches to get Nelson in trouble. Once again, the sinkerballer was doomed by one problematic inning.	"These are good hitters, and if you can't put the ball where you want to -- and we know he has good stuff  -- you still have to command the ball, and he's going to continue to do better at that," Roenicke said.	TURNING POINT	Milwaukee had the potential go-ahead run up with one out in the eighth and NL doubles leader Jonathan Lucroy at the plate. The .304 hitter hit a hard bouncer to reliever Dustin McGowan for an easy 1-6-3 double play.	KNUCKLING DOWN	Dickey, who won the Cy Young in 2012 while with the Mets, wasn't much better after allowing eight hits. Gerardo Parra had a double and triple off Dickey, making him a career 6 of 9 off the knuckleballer.	"I expect more out of myself. Especially there in the sixth, I was one out away from it being a tolerable outing," Dickey said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: RHP Brandon Morrow, on the disabled list since May 3 because of a torn tendon in his right index finger, has "cut it loose" in throwing side sessions but isn't at full strength, Gibbons said. Toronto hopes Morrow will be ready in September, likely out of the bullpen.	Brewers: Roenicke said he hasn't started discussions about what to do with Mike Fiers once RHP Matt Garza returns from the disabled list with a rib cage muscle injury. Garza will go back into the rotation when ready, likely in early next month. Fiers is 3-0 with an 0.86 ERA in three starts since being called up Aug. 9 from Triple-A.	ON DECK	Blue Jays: After an off-day, Toronto returns home to face the Tampa Bay Rays on Friday. RHP Marcus Stroman (7-4) will try to rebound from a rough outing, after he failed to get out of the first and allowed five runs on Aug. 15 to the White Sox.	Brewers: Milwaukee gets its second off-day in four days Thursday. RHP Yovani Gallardo (8-6) has a chance to put the struggling Pirates in deeper trouble in the NL Central when Pittsburgh begins a three-game series Friday.	---	Follow Genaro Armas at http://twitter.com/GArmasAP	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  The New York Mets still consider themselves a contender in the NL East chase even with a daunting deficit to make up over the final month.	They're counting on building on their latest offensive performance.	Lucas Duda hit a three-run homer, Eric Campbell also connected and the Mets beat the Oakland Athletics 8-5 on Wednesday to snap a three-game losing streak.	"I hope it lifts us. I hope it gets us going," manager Terry Collins said. "There were some big hits and some very good at-bats. I just hope this is the start of a final six weeks with some good offensive nights."	Zack Wheeler (9-8) allowed two earned runs while working 5 2/3 solid innings. The Mets split their quick two-game interleague series.	Wheeler is 6-0 with a 2.12 ERA over his nine outings since June 30. The A's chased him after two innings in the shortest start of his career on June 25.	The right-hander and former San Francisco Giants top prospect improved to 4-1 in his last 10 road starts.	Jeurys Familia relieved Vic Black with the bases loaded and one out in the eighth and walked in a run but avoided further damage. He finished for his fourth save.	Campbell and Duda homered during a five-run third against Jeff Samardzija (3-3).	Samardzija had been unbeaten in five previous starts at the Coliseum. Instead, he was done after 3 2/3 innings.	The A's closed to 5-2 in the third on consecutive RBI doubles by Coco Crisp and John Jaso. New York added on in the fourth with RBI singles from Curtis Granderson and Daniel Murphy.	"We strung five, six, seven hits in an inning. It's something to build on," Duda said. "Hopefully we can continue rolling."	Samardzija cruised through a 10-pitch first inning and got through the second unscathed. Acquired in a July 4 trade from the Cubs, he has never beaten the Mets in nine appearances and three starts.	"It's just having trouble putting guys away," Samardzija said. "Probably as simple as that."	Oakland lost for the eighth time in 10 games. The A's returned home from a 1-6 road trip through Kansas City and Atlanta in which they lost their last five.	Murphy's two-run fielding error aided the A's in the fourth. He nearly had the ball, but it skipped off his glove and then he inadvertently kicked it.	PLAN FOR COLON: Bartolo Colon will rejoin the Mets this weekend in Los Angeles and pitch Sunday before returning to the Dominican Republic for his mother's funeral. The right-hander was placed on the bereavement list on Tuesday.	ICE BUCKET CHALLENGE: A's team president Michael Crowley and other club officials participated in the ice bucket challenge for ALS after the game in the right field corner. OF Jonny Gomes did his own version.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: OF Kirk Nieuwenhuis was a late scratch, apparently his stiff neck still an issue.	Athletics: INF Nick Punto, sidelined with a strained right hamstring, is in the beginning stages of running. "It's feeling good. The strength is getting back in there," Punto said. ... 3B Josh Donaldson had much of the day off because "he's a little bit tired right now," manager Bob Melvin said. Donaldson entered as a pinch-hitter in the seventh and had a leadoff single.	UP NEXT	Mets: New York continues its five-game California road trip with the opener of a three-game series Friday against the Dodgers, sending LHP Jonathon Niese (7-8, 3.50 ERA) to the mound looking to improve to 3-0 in six career starts against Los Angeles.	Athletics: The A's have their second off-day in a four-day stretch before opening a key weekend series at home with the division-leading Los Angeles Angels. The schedule allowed Melvin to tweak his rotation and use three top starters: Sonny Gray, Jon Lester and Scott Kazmir. Gray is 0-4 in August after his 6-0 July that earned him AL Pitcher of the Month.	"We have an off-day tomorrow to clear our heads," Melvin said. "We know it will be an exciting series and a big series coming up."	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.

BOSTON -- Garrett Richards lay on the ground for several minutes, his left knee damaged and his season seemingly over.	The right-hander's injury while running to cover first base is a big loss that overshadowed the Los Angeles Angels' seventh win in eight games.	"Winning the game, obviously, it's always important, but it's secondary to what happened," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said after an 8-3 win over the Boston Red Sox on Wednesday night. "This is a tough night for us. We'll just see where Garrett is. Obviously, it's a significant injury."	Richards, 13-4 with a 2.61 ERA, left after 1 2/3 innings with a patellar injury. He will be re-evaluated Thursday in Los Angeles.	"I had a chance to talk to him," Angels pitcher Jered Weaver said. "He just wanted to know what the story was. He wasn't feeling too much pain when he was on the table. When the doctor came in and told him that he might have done something to his patellar tendon and there might be surgery involved, he kind of lost it."	The injury cast a cloud over a strong game by Josh Hamilton, who broke out of a 5-for-41 slump with two hits and three RBIs. Before Tuesday's game, he took extra batting practice.	"Clearing my head and just remembering what it was like as a little kid, in high school, to go out and take BP and have fun," Hamilton said. "It sure helped."	Richards left trailing 2-0. Boston made it 3-0 on David Ortiz's homer in the third off Cory Rasmus (3-1).	That gave Ortiz his eighth 30-homer season with Boston, tying Ted Williams' club record. Ortiz went 4-for-4 and is 8-for-10 in the series with four walks. Alex Hassan pinch hit for him in the ninth and grounded out.	"He was starting to get a little sore. He's obviously been on base this entire series, and he started to get some tightness," Boston manager John Farrell said.	The Angels scored a run in the fourth on a double by Hamilton and an RBI single by Howie Kendrick, and added five in the fifth.	Clay Buchholz (5-8) took a 3-1 lead into the fifth but let the first six batters reach base. That sent Boston toward its fourth straight loss and the Angels to a 1 1/2-game lead in the American League West over the Oakland Athletics.	"Just missed location with a couple of pitches, and they were able to put a big inning together," Buchholz said.	The Angels loaded the bases on a single by Erick Aybar, a walk to Chris Iannetta and a single by Efren Navarro. A walk to Kole Calhoun drove in a run, and Los Angeles tied it when Mike Trout's popup to short right field dropped in. Calhoun was forced out at second after holding up to see whether the ball would be caught.	The next three batters drove in runs: a single by Albert Pujols, a sacrifice fly by Hamilton and a single by Kendrick.	Richards left the field on a stretcher after being hurt on a potential double-play grounder. Brock Holt grounded to first baseman Pujols, who threw to shortstop Aybar for the out at second. Richards fell while running to first for a return throw, but Aybar spun and threw instead to third, where Xander Bogaerts, who had run past the base, dove back safely.	"Garrett's taking this hard," Scioscia said. "This is a huge blow for him."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: Hamilton played center field as Trout was switched to designated hitter. Scioscia said nothing was physically bothering Trout, but he wanted to give him some rest.	Red Sox: Catcher David Ross started following a stint on the disabled list with right plantar fasciitis. Third baseman Will Middlebrooks didn't play after straining his right hamstring while running out an infield single in the Angels' 4-3 win Tuesday night.	UP NEXT	Angels: RHP Matt Shoemaker (11-4, 3.84 ERA) pitches Thursday night as the Angels go for a four-game sweep. Shoemaker last faced the Red Sox on Aug. 9, when he shut them out for the last three innings of the Angels' 5-4 win in 19 innings.	Red Sox: RHP Rubby De La Rosa (4-4, 3.79) goes for the Red Sox. On Aug. 10, he allowed one run in seven innings in a 3-1 win over the Angels.	WASTED CHANCES	The Red Sox left 10 runners on and were 1-for-12 with runners in scoring position. In the first three games of the series, they've stranded 41 runners and are 2-for-39 with runners in scoring position.	WHAT A RELIEF	Six Angels relievers allowed one run and six hits in 7 1/3 innings with five strikeouts and two walks. One night after getting his 34th save, Huston Street pitched a perfect ninth.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK --  Put aside the playoff talk. Jacoby Ellsbury and the New York Yankees are having a tough enough time with Houston.	Scott Feldman shut down the slumping Yankees again, and Robbie Grossman snapped a seventh-inning tie with a two-run single that sent the Astros to a 5-2 victory Wednesday night.	Dexter Fowler had an RBI double, Jose Altuve added a run-scoring single, and the Astros (54-73) did more damage to New York's postseason chances with their fourth victory in five meetings this year.	Houston, which has finished with the worst record in the majors each of the past three seasons, won a series at Yankee Stadium for the first time in four tries.	The fourth-place Astros improved to 4-7 in the Bronx and will go for a three-game sweep Thursday afternoon.	"We haven't been giving up toward the end of the game. We just keep grinding out at-bats, and things are working out for us," Grossman said.	Stephen Drew hit his first homer for New York, and Ellsbury drove in a run with a bunt single. But the Yankees (63-61) lost for the seventh time in nine games and dropped five games out of a playoff spot.	They are 2 for 17 with runners in scoring position during the series and have totaled 20 runs in their last nine games, never scoring more than four in that stretch.	"We've got to score more than two runs. It's hard to win when you only score two runs," manager Joe Girardi said. "Our pitching has been pretty good, but that's a pretty tall task."	Ellsbury flied out against Jose Veras with two on to end it. New York stranded 10 in all.	"I knew it was in the park. It was a great sinker," Veras said.	Feldman (7-9) matched a career high by throwing 121 pitches and worked out of trouble to last 6 2/3 innings. He gave up two runs and eight hits, striking out a season-best seven.	The right-hander tossed 6 2/3 shutout innings to beat the Yankees on opening day. Houston had lost his previous six road starts, but he entered with a 2.30 ERA during four straight quality starts against New York.	"He's a veteran guy and he's been around the game for a long time. He knows how to pitch," Fowler said.	Making his second start since a long injury layoff, Michael Pineda took a 2-1 lead into the seventh. He threw 89 pitches and was pulled after a leadoff walk to Jason Castro.	Looking to rest his best relievers following a heavy workload the past few days, Girardi turned to David Huff (2-1) and Esmil Rogers. They failed miserably, ruining the manager's bobblehead night.	Houston smacked five straight one-out singles, four off Rogers, in a span of 10 pitches.	"We have relied on the home run quite a bit, and today was a prime example of keeping the line moving," Astros manager Bo Porter said. "I felt like guys had great at-bats."	No. 9 batter Jake Marisnick tied it with a single to left, Grossman put the Astros up 4-2, and Altuve added an RBI single as the boos increased for Rogers.	"When the other guys are used a lot, guys have to step up," Girardi said. "It just didn't happen tonight."	Kevin Chapman struck out Ellsbury with runners at second and third to end the bottom half. Veras worked the ninth for his first save since Sept. 2, 2013, with Detroit.	"It was nice to see Chapman come in, probably the biggest part of the game, and pick me up. I owe him a dinner or something like that," Feldman said.	Seemingly resigned to trying small ball, the Yankees went 4 for 5 on stolen base attempts in the first five innings. But one pitch after Chase Headley was caught at second in the fourth, Drew hit his fifth home run of the season. The other four came with Boston before a July 31 trade.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: Regular closer Chad Qualls was unavailable because of a stiff back. He is day to day.	Yankees: Slumping DH-RF Carlos Beltran sat out because of pain in his troublesome right elbow and was examined by a doctor. He had his third cortisone shot and is day to day. "Hopefully, this is the last one," said Beltran, who hopes to return to the lineup on Friday. "At the end of the year I have to address it and get the surgery to get it over with, but right now I'm just trying to finish the season." ... RHP David Phelps (elbow inflammation) played catch and will try to get ready to come off the disabled list as a reliever, Girardi said.	UP NEXT	LHP Dallas Keuchel (10-8, 3.11 ERA) makes his first career start against the Yankees in the series finale. RHP Brandon McCarthy is 4-2 with a 2.30 ERA in seven outings for New York since he was acquired from Arizona in early July.	HERE COMES TROUBLE	Fowler is 9 for 20 (.450) with six extra-base hits against the Yankees this year.	NICE GRAB	Yankees LF Brett Gardner tumbled head over heels over a low retaining wall to make a courageous catch in the ninth.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

WASHINGTON -- Bryce Harper has a suggestion for those looking for the perfect word to describe the Washington Nationals' recent run of walk-off victories and nine straight wins overall.	Harper scored the winning run on pinch hitter Anthony Rendon's single in the ninth inning as Washington edged the Arizona Diamondbacks 3-2 on Wednesday night.	"It's absolutely epic. That's the best word I can put out there," Harper said.	Five of Washington's past six victories have been by a single run, with four coming in its last at-bat.	"It's been incredible," Harper said. "This team has a lot of fight, a lot of heart. We never die."	Harper opened the ninth with a single off Evan Marshall (4-3) and went to third base on Kevin Frandsen's one-out single. Out of the starting lineup for the first time in 63 games, Rendon singled past third baseman Cliff Pennington to win it.	"It was different to say the least, but it was awesome," Rendon said of the pinch hit.	Neither epic nor awesome describes what manager Matt Williams feels watching the slew of walk-off wins.	"It's gratifying for (the players), it's exciting for them," Williams said. "It's not a whole of fun in the dugout for the staff, but that's OK."	The Nationals had last won nine in a row when they matched a franchise record by winning 10 straight in June 2005.	The National League East leaders also extended their home winning streak to eight and opened a seven-game lead over Atlanta.	Rafael Soriano (3-1) pitched the ninth for the win.	Arizona has lost five straight and is 5-13 in August.	"In the end, they out-executed us in every phase of the game," Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson said. "They pitched good, and we didn't pitch good enough. They out-fielded us. They outhit us."	Two of Washington's wins in this series have come in its last at-bat after Arizona tied the game late.	"Of course it's disappointing," Gibson said. "They've got it rolling and they overtook us again."	Tanner Roark threw seven scoreless innings for the Nationals and left with a 2-0 lead. He gave up five hits. Roark is 5-1 with a 2.09 ERA over his past eight starts.	The Diamondbacks tied it in the eighth on Ender Inciarte's two-run homer against reliever Tyler Clippard.	Drew Storen replaced Clippard with one on in the eighth, eventually stranding the runner at third base.	Arizona starter Trevor Cahill allowed two runs and six hits over 6 1/3 innings.	Wilson Ramos' RBI groundout in the second inning gave the Nationals a 1-0 lead. Asdrubal Cabrera and Jayson Werth hit consecutive doubles to put Washington up 2-0 in the sixth.	Harper had three of Washington's nine hits.	The game started 12 minutes late due to rain.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: Williams sounded hopeful that 3B/OF Ryan Zimmerman could return "sometime in September" from a hamstring injury. Zimmerman was placed on the disabled list July 23.	Diamondbacks: In his fourth rehab appearance, Daniel Hudson tossed one scoreless inning with two strikeouts Tuesday night in the Arizona Rookie League. The right-hander hasn't pitched at the major league level since 2012 after sustaining an elbow injury that resulted in Tommy John surgery twice.	UP NEXT	Arizona's Wade Miley (7-9, 4.46 ERA) faces fellow left-hander Gio Gonzalez (6-9, 4.06) on Thursday in the finale of the four-game set.	NOT JUST A PITCHER	Leading 1-0 in the sixth, Roark deftly fielded Miguel Montero's grounder to start an inning-ending 1-6-3 double play after the Diamondbacks put runners on the corners with one out.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Pirates were looking for a way to break their seven-game losing skid.	They got a little help when Justin Upton dropped a routine fly ball to left-centerfield in the ninth which set the stage for Gaby Sanchez's game-winning sacrifice fly that capped a late-inning comeback as the Pittsburgh Pirates defeated the Atlanta Braves 3-2 on Wednesday night.	"We try to pride ourselves on not being surprised by success," manager Clint Hurdle said. "To get the two to tie it up then some help and to win, yeah, it's a real nice shot in the arm."	David Carpenter (4-4) took the loss after allowing an unearned run to cross. Jordy Mercer led off with a single and Starling Marte's fly ball to left-center advanced him to third, where Mercer tagged up on Sanchez's flyout.	"We make that play 99 1-2 out of 100 times," Atlanta manager Fredi Gonzalez said about the outfield error.	The Pirates now have 32 comeback wins in 2014, accounting for nearly half of their 65 wins overall.	"We don't ever feel like we're down." Sanchez said. "It doesn't matter if we're down by four or five. We can still come back and win a ball game."	Pittsburgh's victory ended Atlanta's five-game winning streak.	Upton drove in a run with a single in the first inning after Jason Heyward walked and Freddie Freeman singled. Upton's single extended his hitting streak to 11 games.	After allowing a double to Evan Gattis leading off the second, Pittsburgh right-hander Gerrit Cole retired the next 12 batters he faced before Heyward singled in the sixth.	Heyward scored again on a RBI single by Chris Johnson for a 2-0 Atlanta lead, and finished 1 for 3 with a walk and two runs scored.	Josh Harrison led off the first with a double, but was picked off by Atlanta left-hander Alex Wood. He was ruled out on a replay-review that overturned a safe call on Alex Wood's throw over.	Pittsburgh didn't place another man in scoring position until the eighth inning when Wood issued a walk to Sanchez and Travis Snider doubled before Wood recorded an out.	Jordan Walden entered and allowed each of his inherited runners to score. Chris Stewart brought Sanchez home with a RBI groundout to first base and Snider scored on a wild pitch as Walden walked Neil Walker.	Snider was the only player with a multi-hit game, going 2 for 3 and extending his hitting streak to 11 games.	Cole lasted through seven and gave up two runs, five hits and four walks and struck out six in his first start since July 4.	"The location certainly got better as the game went on," Cole said. "We were just able to put our foot down when we needed to and to come back and grab a couple runs at the end was big."	Wood threw seven-plus and allowed two runs, four hits and a walk.	Mark Melancon (2-3) worked a 1-2-3 ninth to earn a win.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Braves: SS Andrelton Simmons (hip) started for the Braves after he was removed from Tuesday's game. ... RHP Shae Simmons (right shoulder soreness) is shut down for the near future after he felt soreness following his second rehab outing with Triple-A Gwinnett.	Pirates: RHP Charlie Morton (hip) says his injury is a sports hernia. He was placed on the disabled list Monday, retroactive to Aug. 16, with what the team called right hip inflammation. Hurdle said the plan is to "try to calm the hip down." Morton will likely see a doctor soon and a return-to-pitch program for this season is still a possibility.	ON DECK	Braves: Atlanta continues its road trip with a three-game series at Great American Ballpark against the Cincinnati Reds. RHP Julio Teheran (11-9, 3.06 ERA looks for his first career win against the Reds and LHP David Holmberg (0-0, 16.88 ERA)	Pirates: Pittsburgh receives an off-day Thursday as the Pirates travel to Milwaukee for a three-game set over the weekend with their division-rival Brewers. LHP Jeff Locke (4-3, 3.73 ERA) matches up with RHP Yovani Gallardo (8-6, 3.32 ERA) Friday night, who Locke previously lost a decision to June 8 at PNC Park when the Brewers won 1-0.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Rick Porcello hasn't won any Cy Young awards like three of his teammates, but he has pitched some of the better games of the season for the Detroit Tigers.	One of them came Wednesday night when Porcello pitched a three-hitter for his AL-leading third shutout, a 6-0 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays.	"Nine shutout innings. You literally can't ask for anything more," said Tiger manager Brad Ausmus.	Victor Martinez hit a grand slam and drove in five runs for the Tigers, who handed the Rays their fourth loss in a row.	Porcello (14-8) moved into a tie for the league lead in wins, retiring 20 straight batters after Ben Zobrist's double in the first.	"I felt pretty good from the get-go really," he said. "Even the hit I gave up to Zobrist was a good pitch, and I felt pretty confident that if I kept making pitches like that I was going to get guys out and pitch deep into the game."	Porcello walked none and struck out four in his first win since Aug. 2. He matched Miami's Henderson Alvarez for the major league lead in shutouts and became the first Tiger with three in a season since Jeff Weaver in 2002.	"I think the biggest thing, when you get a game going like that, is to get the first guy out," Porcello said. "If you can get the first guy out, especially for me, or keep the double play intact when somebody does get on base, that makes the game a lot quicker."	The Rays were shut out for the 15th time, most of any American League team. They didn't get a leadoff man on base until the eighth.	"From the side it looked like a wiffle ball, like playing in your back yard and the ball is just doing all kinds of weird things," said Rays manager Joe Maddon. "For the most part (Porcello got) a lot of groundball outs. That's what he is."	Martinez hit his fourth career slam, connecting off Kirby Yates in the seventh inning, completing a five-run burst started by Rajai Davis' two-out double. It was the 24th homer of the season for Martinez.	Martinez drove in the Tigers' first run with a two-out double in the first after Miguel Cabrera's single. Cabrera also walked twice and scored two runs.	Wil Myers, the reigning AL Rookie of the Year, went 0 for 3 as the designated hitter in his return to the Rays' lineup after missing 70 games because of a broken right wrist.	"Really didn't get a pitch over the plate to hit. It's just one of those games," Myers said. "I could have been coming into this game and been really hot, but the way he pitched I think the results would have been the same."	Rays starter Jake Odorizzi (9-10) gave up three runs while striking out seven in 6 2/3 innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: RHP Justin Verlander (sore right shoulder) could rejoin the rotation Saturday after missing one start.	Rays: OF David DeJesus (broken left hand) resumed a rehab assignment with Single-A Charlotte. He had taken three days off due to soreness in the hand.	UP NEXT	Former Rays ace David Price (12-8) will face his old team Thursday for the first time since being dealt to Detroit on July 31. Tampa Bay will counter with RHP Alex Cobb (8-6). "It's still weird, but once the game starts, it's me vs. the Tigers lineup," Cobb said. "It's going to be more weird for him, I think, facing the Rays."	HIT IT HARD	PGA Tour golfer John Daly threw out the ceremonial first pitch. Daly, who has a hit song called "Hit it Hard" on The Highway Sirius Channel 56, lives in Clearwater, Fla.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ST. LOUIS --  Facing Johnny Cueto definitely brought out the best in the Cardinals' Lance Lynn.	"It didn't hurt my feelings one bit beating him," the right-hander said after working seven scoreless innings against the 15-game winner in St. Louis' 7-3 victory over the Cincinnati Reds Wednesday night.	"You see all the leader boards and you see his name up at the top. I outpitched him tonight, so yeah."	Lynn beat Cincinnati for the third straight time and Jhonny Peralta hit a bases-clearing double for St. Louis.	Manager Mike Matheny said he'd anticipated seeing "how Lance bows his neck" against Cueto. "It's a great opportunity to show what you can do," the manager added.	Cueto (15-7) was off-kilter from the get-go and missed a chance to become the majors' first 16-game winner. He allowed five runs in five-plus innings, and his seven-game winning streak ended.	"He just labored," manager Bryan Price said. "We've come to expect him to be great every time and today just wasn't one of those times."	The Cardinals have won eight of nine and swept the Reds at home for the first time since Sept. 26-28, 2008. Cincinnati has lost 10 of 12, with Cueto getting the two wins.	Jon Jay had three hits, scored twice and was plunked by a pitch for the sixth time in six games for St. Louis. He is batting .514 (18 for 35) during a 12-game hitting streak, and has been hit by a pitch a majors-leading 16 times.	Lynn (14-8) gave up four singles and was set to pitch the eighth leading 5-0 before a 58-minute rain delay ended his outing.	"You always want to keep going," Lynn said. "For it to be ended by rain, that's never a great feeling. But we won the game, that's all that matters."	The Reds scored three times in the ninth, and Trevor Rosenthal got two outs for his 37th save in 42 chances.	Brandon Phillips got his first hit of the series, a single in the Reds seventh for the 1,500th of his career. Reds pinch hitters were 3 for 4 in a three-run ninth, including an RBI infield hit by Kris Negron.	Cueto had numerous mound conferences with catcher Brayan Pena and was pulled after walking Lynn on four pitches to load the bases with none out in the sixth. It wasn't particularly hot, 86 degrees for the first pitch, but the right-hander said humidity took a toll.	"I'm used to pitching with long sleeves and it was so wet and my hand was getting really slippery," Cueto said through a translator. "I could not grip the ball the way I wanted."	The weather didn't seem to bother Lynn.	"They were sweating, they both were," Matheny said of the starting pitchers. "But he just never looked like he was gassed at all."	Cueto had been 7-0 with a 2.24 ERA in his previous eight starts, including 3-0 this month. But matched his shortest outing of the year and season high with four walks, plus hit two batters.	Jay singled and scored on Matt Holliday's double in the third. Jay reached on a two-out infield hit in the fifth, leading to Peralta's three-run double.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: RHP Carlos Contreras gave up two runs and got two outs in the eighth. He was taken out after a misstep on a pitch after play resumed, and Price had no immediate update after the game. ... Closer Aroldis Chapman missed the first two games with a sore left shoulder and played catch Wednesday.	Cardinals: C Yadier Molina, recovering from a torn ligament to his right thumb, took swings for the first time indoors. He's been throwing in pregame workouts for a few days.	UP NEXT	Reds: Rookie LHP David Holmberg (0-0, 16.88) makes his second career start to open a four-game series Thursday at home against Atlanta.	Cardinals: After a day off, RHP Adam Wainwright (15-7, 2.40) will flip spots with Shelby Miller and start on regular rest Friday night at Philadelphia.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CHICAGO --  Jake Peavy is showing signs of getting back on track, and his timing couldn't be better for the San Francisco Giants.	The 33-year-old right-hander pitched seven solid innings in his fifth start with San Francisco, and the Giants rolled past the Chicago Cubs 8-3 on Wednesday, hours after they won a protest regarding a rain-shortened loss from the night before.	Peavy (2-3) has won two straight after losing his first three starts with San Francisco following a July 26 trade from Boston where he was 1-9.	"I never gave up hope or thought I wasn't going to win," Peavy said. "I didn't really do anything different tonight other than just the team scored and made my job a whole lot easier.	"We've got five or six more starts and I've got to try to find a way to win those with us trying to get in (the playoffs)."	Peavy allowed 10 hits, struck out eight and walked none. Chris Valaika's two-run homer in the second inning accounted for the only runs against him.	Hunter Pence and Andrew Susac homered, and Travis Ishikawa drove in three runs with pair of doubles among three hits to help the Giants strengthen their hold on an NL wild card spot.	The Cubs' Luis Valbuena added a solo homer and a triple in going 3 for 4.	Struggling starter Edwin Jackson (6-14) was hit hard in just 2 2/3 innings, his shortest outing of the season. He allowed seven runs, eight hits and two walks. Jackson has lost seven of eight decisions.	"It's just terrible," Jackson said. "There's no excuse for it, pretty much. Tonight I didn't help myself. I didn't help my team."	Before the game, the Giants won their protest filed with Major League Baseball over Tuesday night's rain-shortened loss that was called in the fifth inning.	A problem in getting the tarp onto the field caused unplayable conditions, and the game was ruled a 2-0 Cubs win after a delay of over four hours. The suspended game will be completed on Thursday before the regularly scheduled game between the teams.	"We needed Jake to get somewhat deep in the game," manager Bruce Bochy said.  "A long day tomorrow. We have a lot of innings to play."	MLB ruled the tarp hadn't been properly put away after its previous use, and therefore there was a "malfunction of a mechanical field device under control of the home club."	MLB said this was the first successful protest since 1986.	On Wednesday, the Giants jumped out to a 4-0 lead in the first inning as five of their first six batters reached base. Ishikawa drove in two runs with his first double to cap the outburst.	Ishikawa doubled in another run in the third and scored on Susac's first career homer as San Francisco opened a 7-2 lead.	Pence led off the fourth against Carlos Villenueva with his 17th homer of this season to make it 8-2.	UP NEXT	The suspended game will resume on Thursday with the Cubs batting in the bottom of the 5th inning and leading 2-0. San Francisco's Yesmeiro Petit (3-3, 3.89) and Chicago's Jacob Turner (4-7, 5.80) will step in to start that one. In the regularly scheduled game, Giants LHP Madison Bumgarner (13-9, 3.14) is slated to face Cubs LHP Travis Wood (7-10, 4.86).	TRAINER'S ROOM	Giants: C Buster Posey was out of the lineup because of soreness in his left hip. Bochy likened it to an unscheduled day off and expected Posey to be back behind the plate on Thursday.	Posey is batting .278 with 13 home runs. He was replaced by Susac.	Cubs: SS Starlin Castro was a last-minute scratch from the lineup due to a family emergency. The team didn't provide details or say how long he would be out, but said it was likely he'd be placed on the bereavement list.	LHP Felix Doubront, placed on the DL with a left calf strain on Aug. 1, threw on the side on Wednesday. He is expected to make another rehab start at Double-A Tennessee on Sunday or Monday. Manager Rick Renteria said Doubront, acquired from Boston on July 30, is in line to be recalled and start on Aug. 30 when the Cubs play a doubleheader at St. Louis.	BALLPARK WATER-GATE	The infield was still damp and the areas under the stands at century-old Wrigley Field reeked of mold even more than usual following Tuesday's night's downpour that led to the game being called at 1:16 a.m. The storm apparently was very localized. Cubs GM Jed Hoyer said it didn't rain at his house, some 12 blocks from the ballpark.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO --  After the Baltimore Orioles beat the Chicago White Sox 4-3 Wednesday night, Nelson Cruz said he was more focused on the team than any personal accomplishments.	That's not a bad way to be with the Orioles these days.	Cruz took the major league lead with his 33rd home run and the surging Orioles completed a three-game sweep of the White Sox. Adam Jones and Steve Pearce also homered as the Orioles won their fourth straight and extended their AL East lead to nine games over second-place Toronto.	Cruz matched his career high for homers and moved one ahead of White Sox rookie Jose Abreu and Miami's Giancarlo Stanton.	"It's just personal stuff. I'm happy because we're winning," Cruz said. "That's the main goal here."	It's clear then that the Orioles are reaching plenty of their goals.	Baltimore posted its first sweep in Chicago over the White Sox since July 1995. And it did so thanks to its power -- the Orioles hit three homers off Hector Noesi (7-9) and lead baseball with 161.	Baltimore also got plenty of pitching, with Wei-Yin Chen (13-4) going 7 1/3 innings and allowing three runs and six hits before Zach Britton picked up his 27th save in 30 tries. That was good news for the noisy, orange-clad Orioles fans who made up a decent portion of the crowd and saw their team improve to 39-26 on the road.	"If you pitch well, you give yourself some opportunities," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. "There's some things we weren't perfect at tonight. When you pitch well, it can cover some things and when you catch the baseball."	Chen fell behind early when he allowed a two-run homer in the first to Avisail Garcia and left in the eighth leading 4-3 after allowing one-out singles to Alexei Ramirez and Alejandro De Aza.	But Darren O'Day struck out Abreu then Garcia to end the threat.	"That's a tough spot for them and (O'Day) came through big," White Sox manager Robin Ventura said. "You get a guy, a sidewinder like that, it's a tough at-bat for those guys."	Noesi went seven innings as the White Sox fell a season-high nine games below .500.	"You know, when you miss a pitch, you miss the location they go for it," Noesi said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: 3B Manny Machado reported his sprained right ankle had been slow to respond to treatment and exercises.	White Sox: General manager Rick Hahn said OF Adam Eaton (strained right oblique) could be off the disabled list next week and will go on a rehab assignment soon.	UP NEXT	Orioles: RHP Kevin Gausman (7-4, 3.70) faces Cubs RHP Jake Arrieta (6-4, 2.61) on Friday at Wrigley Field. Arrieta spent parts of four seasons with the Orioles before being traded last July to Chicago.	White Sox: LHP John Danks (9-8, 4.94) faces Yankees RHP Shane Greene (3-1, 2.91) on Friday in New York. Danks is 2-2 with a 6.20 ERA since July 1.	CLOSE TO HOME	Curt Schilling's revelation of oral cancer hit home to Showalter, who called the ex-pitcher "one of the favorite players I ever had (managed)." Schilling blamed his condition on smokeless tobacco, which Showalter said he used occasionally. "It's a very serious issue," Showalter said.	COMING ATTRACTION	There has been speculation that Carlos Rodon, the No. 3 overall pick in this year's draft, could be called up by the White Sox before the end of the season. But Hahn said "there is nothing set in stone in terms of him coming here or not coming here."	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Mike Aviles didn't know his numbers against Ricky Nolasco going into Wednesday night's game. But he's glad his manager did.	Aviles homered among his three hits and drove in two runs, and rookie T.J. House threw shutout ball into the sixth inning, combining with four relievers to pitch the Cleveland Indians past the Minnesota Twins 5-0 Wednesday night.	Indians manager Terry Francona started Aviles at third base and rested regular starter Lonnie Chisenhall, in part because Aviles had a good track record against Nolasco (5-9).	Aviles went 2 for 3 off the Twins' starter and drove in the Indians' third run with a broken-bat single. He's now 7 for 11 with 4 RBIs in his career against Nolasco.	"I didn't even know that. I know I've hit some balls decently against (Nolasco) but I didn't know the numbers," said Aviles, who homered into the second deck in left field off reliever Sam Deduno in the ninth inning as well. "I don't even know what it is. I guess sometimes you just see some pitchers a little better than others."	Nolasco gave up four runs in 6 2/3 innings. He has now given up 17 home runs in 20 starts. No Twins pitcher has allowed more homers or lost more games this season than Nolasco, who signed a four-year, $48 million contract last December to anchor Minnesota's rotation.	"They definitely did attack, but that's something that's happened throughout my career because they know I'm going to fill up the strike zone for the most part," Nolasco said. "Sometimes they jump on me a little bit but if you make adjustments and make quality pitches you'll get guys out."	House (2-3) gave up four hits while striking out five and walked three. The Indians extended Minnesota's scoreless streak to 17 innings.	TITO TAKES THE PLUNGE	Francona conducted his postgame press briefing in a soggy uniform after he and his coaches taped an ice bucket challenge in the dugout after the game. Francona was challenged by Boston manager John Farrell, but he had another Red Sox great on his mind as he was drenched.	"The whole time I was doing it, I don't want to get all emotional, but I was thinking of Curt Schilling," Francona said of his former ace pitcher now battling cancer. "I know how near and dear the fight to find a cure for this is to him."	DOUBLE THREAT	Twins 2B Brian Dozier became the sixth player in team history with a 20/20 season when he stole second base in the first inning. Torii Hunter was the last Twin to accomplish the feat in 2004. Dozier, who also has 20 homers, posted career highs with 18 home runs and 14 stolen bases last year.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: 1B/OF Nick Swisher underwent season-ending arthroscopic surgery on both knees on Wednesday. He had been suffering from chronic pain related to cartilage damage. Swisher's recovery is expected to take eight to 10 weeks.	Twins: RHP Kohl Stewart, the fourth pick in the 2013 MLB draft, was pulled from his start at Class A Cedar Rapids in the second inning on Tuesday night when his fastball was registering 5-to-7 mph slower than usual. Twins general manager Terry Ryan said he didn't think Stewart's situation was serious, and that he hoped Stewart would make another start before the end of the minor league season.	UP NEXT	Indians: Corey Kluber (13-6) hasn't lost since June 30 and can tie for the AL lead in victories if he wins his seventh straight decision on Thursday. Kluber has struck out 10 batters five times in his last eight starts.	Twins: Phil Hughes (13-8) also can tie for the AL lead in victories with a win Thursday. Hughes has won three straight starts, allowing just one earned run in each outing.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DENVER --  Matt McBride is so new to the Colorado Rockies that he doesn't even have his nameplate above his locker yet.	Didn't take him long to make a big impact, though.	McBride hit his first career grand slam and Jorge De La Rosa pitched eight crisp innings, helping the Rockies cool off the Kansas City Royals with a 5-2 win on Wednesday night.	"Just trying to have a good at-bat and hit the ball hard and try to make something happen," McBride said.	With one swing, McBride derailed the Royals' roll, snapping their three-game winning streak. Kansas City saw its lead in the AL Central shrink to one over Detroit.	Danny Duffy (8-11) was cruising along with a 2-1 lead until a two-out error by third baseman Christian Colon in the sixth opened the door for a big inning. McBride lined a fastball from Duffy into the left-field bleachers and then zipped around the bases in exhilaration.	"Just had an adrenaline rush," he said.	It was McBride's first homer since Sept. 25, 2012, and third of his career. He was called up from Triple-A Colorado Springs the day before after what's been a tumultuous past two seasons. He missed a big chunk of 2013 after undergoing neck surgery and was out earlier this year with a broken foot.	"Another guy with a great story, who's been through a lot," Rockies manager Walt Weiss said.	That was more than enough for De La Rosa (13-8), who allowed five hits and two run against his former team. He also got the Royals to hit into four double plays, tying a franchise record for most by a single pitcher in a game.	Even more, he improved to 9-2 at Coors Field -- a place that's haunted many a pitcher, but not the hard-throwing lefty.	"I like to pitch here," De La Rosa said. "It's a challenge for me every time I pitch here."	Duffy was in command most of the night as he allowed five hits and five runs, one earned, in seven innings. After getting two quick outs in the sixth, Colon fielded a grounder and threw a one-hopper that first baseman Billy Butler couldn't scoop. Wilin Rosario singled and Corey Dickerson drew a walk to set the stage for McBride.	"I wish I could take it back and make the play," Colon said.	Another hard-luck loss for Duffy, who's the only AL starter with a losing record and an ERA under three runs.	"I can't lose focus like I did on that one pitch," said Duffy, whose team finished 15-5 in interleague play. "I feel terrible for the mistake I made."	CHALLENGING CHANGEUP	This was just the second time De La Rosa faced his old team. He spent two seasons with the Royals before being dealt to Colorado in 2008 for cash considerations.	He was cashing in on his changeup to get out of one jam after another.	"His changeup, that's his moneymaker," Weiss said. "It's a great pitch."	Royals manager Ned Yost seconded that opinion.	"His changeup is a killer," said Yost, whose team has won 22 of their last 28 games. "It's a hard pitch to pick up."	De La Rosa's only mistake was in the second when he grooved a 91-mph fastball that Alex Gordon hit into the right-field bleachers.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals: C Salvador Perez was a late scratch because of tightness in his right knee. He will have a precautionary MRI on Thursday.	Rockies: OF Michael Cuddyer was out another day with a strained left hamstring. He said he's confident he will be back in the lineup Friday.	UP NEXT	Royals: After a day off, Kansas City begins a three-game series in Texas. Yordano Ventura (9-9) will start Friday. His nine wins are third-most among rookies this season.	Rockies: The Rockies have their second off day this week on Thursday. They begin a three-game series with Miami on Friday. LHP Franklin Morales (5-6) will get the start after missing his last turn in the rotation for the birth of his daughter.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

LOS ANGELES --  Eric Stults is having quite a month of August and going against his old team didn't hurt either.	The left-hander allowed one run on four hits in five innings of the San Diego Padres' 4-1 win over the NL West-leading Los Angeles Dodgers on Wednesday night.	"I'm just executing pitches a little bit better," Stults said. "Early on I was giving up a lot of extra-base hits, a lot of home runs, whereas now I've limited the damage more to just singles."	Stults improved to 3-0 with a 1.46 ERA in four starts this month while picking up just his second road win of the season.	"He knows how to feed off hitters' aggressiveness," Dodgers catcher A.J. Ellis said. "Now you see he's pitching free and easy. He's pitching with a lot of confidence."	Stults (6-13) struck out five and walked one. The Dodgers came into the game with a 20-10 record against left-handed opponents, but Stults did just enough against the team he pitched for from 2006-09.	"He made a conscious effort to tweak his delivery a little bit, especially out of the windup, and a little minor adjustment out of the stretch -- sort of an upbeat, momentum-building delivery," Padres manager Bud Black said. "That's helped his conviction with the fastball."	Kevin Quackenbush pitched the ninth to earn his first major league save. He started a 1-2-3 putout to end the game.	"It's a pretty awesome feeling," he said. "I got a couple in the minor leagues, but this first one in the big leagues is always going to be special to me. I was a little more nervous than I have been in previous outings."	Alexi Amarista had two hits, drove in a run, walked and stole a base, Rymer Liriano went 2 for 3 with a walk and two runs scored, and Seth Smith went 2 for 5 for the Padres, who pounded out 11 hits in ending a two-game skid.	Roberto Hernandez (7-9) gave up four runs and eight hits in five innings. He struck out two and walked two in his 200th career start and first as a member of the home team at Dodger Stadium. He was acquired from Philadelphia earlier this month.	"I didn't feel it was my best," Hernandez said through a translator. "I got behind in the count. I just wasn't able to get in a rhythm. I was getting outside of the zone a little bit."	Just like a night earlier, the Padres took an early 3-0 lead. In the second, Amarista singled in their first run. Stults followed with a bases-loaded RBI single, and Liriano scored on a throwing error by left fielder Scott Van Slyke, who twice bobbled the ball trying to control it.	The Dodgers closed to 3-1 in the third on Matt Kemp's sacrifice fly.	Yangervis Solarte made it 4-1 with a sacrifice fly in the fourth.	HITTING LA	Amarista raised his batting average to .333 in 12 games against the Dodgers this season. He's even better at Dodger Stadium (.365) with two doubles, a homer and nine RBI in 21 career games. Smith boosted his average to .407 with a double, four homers and five RBI in 11 games against L.A.	STEAL THIS	Dee Gordon stole his 57th base in the eighth, moving into sole possession of seventh on the Dodgers' single-season steals list, passing Steve Sax who had 56 in 1983.	MAYBIN RETURNS	Padres outfielder Cameron Maybin was reinstated from the restricted list, having served a 25-game suspension for testing positive for an amphetamine. He had said his failed test was a result of a change in the medication he was using to treat attention deficit disorder. Maybin entered as a defensive replacement in the ninth. To make room on the roster, the Padres optioned infielder Jace Peterson to Triple-A El Paso and designated pitcher Bobby LaFromboise for assignment.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: Closer Joaquin Benoit has been bothered by shoulder problems, and Black said it makes sense to consider putting him on the DL. "We still have another day or two to assess this and see if Joaquin responds to treatment," he said. "If we can hold off on that, then we win."	Dodgers: Pitcher Zack Greinke has experienced elbow discomfort similar to what he had last season. A MRI didn't show any damage, but the team wants to be cautious. "It's something that comes and goes," Greinke said. "I expect to pitch at a hundred percent level, but I don't expect to feel a hundred percent."	ON DECK	Padres: Tyson Ross (11-11, 2.70 ERA) takes the mound in the series finale. The right-hander has 13 starts of six or more innings pitched while allowing one run or fewer earned runs, tied for the most such starts with Adam Wainwright of St. Louis.	Dodgers: Clayton Kershaw (14-3, 1.86) starts in place of Greinke, who will be pushed back to Saturday against the Mets, with Dan Haren going on Friday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CHICAGO -- This gives new meaning to a win that was a long time coming for the Chicago Cubs.	After two days, the first upheld protest in nearly 30 years and another rainstorm, the Cubs finally completed a 2-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants in a suspended game Thursday night.	Including delays -- 1 hour, 57 minutes Thursday -- the game lasted 9:21.	"It was an interesting day today," Cubs manager Rick Renteria said. "We got more weather."	Anthony Rizzo's two-run homer from Tuesday held up as the teams played the final 4 1/2 innings of a game the Cubs thought they had won 2-0 before Major League Baseball ruled it was suspended.	In the middle of the fifth inning Tuesday, a short rainstorm caused a delay of more than 4 1/2 hours after the grounds crew couldn't put the tarp down quickly. The umpires said the field was unplayable and called it at 1:16 a.m. local time.	But the Giants protested, and MLB ruled that the tarp had not been properly put away after its previous use. The game was ruled suspended.	Then it rained some more Thursday.	Giants manager Bruce Bochy, who expressed his frustration Tuesday, was satisfied with how the game played out.	"It was a little bit of a strange one with the suspended game today," said Bochy, who added, "You know, they got it right."	It was the first successful protest in MLB since 1986.	For the Cubs, who supported the Giants' protest, it felt good to win without grounds crew assistance.	"I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you that we wanted to close it out," Renteria said. "Everyone did everything possible to get it in. "	Joe Panik had an RBI single in the sixth to pull the Giants to 2-1, but they were unable to scratch another run across against the Cubs' bullpen.	Tuesday's starters proved to be the pitchers of record. Tsuyoshi Wada (3-1) earned the victory for the Cubs, while Ryan Vogelsong (7-9) took the loss.	Hector Rondon worked a scoreless ninth for his 19th save in 23 opportunities, putting runners on first and second before ending it by stopping Angel Pagan's comebacker with his foot.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: Right-hander Edwin Jackson was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a right lat strain. Jackson dealt with a similar injury at the end of last season and hopes that by going on the DL now, he will be able to pitch again in September. ... Shortstop Starlin Castro was placed on the bereavement list after leaving the team for a family emergency. Bereavement list rules require a minimum stay of three days and a maximum stay of one week.	Giants: Infielder Ehire Adrianza has been slow to recover from a second strained groin injury, which raises doubts about his status in the final weeks of the season. "He's not ready yet, so that's another decision we'll have to make," Bochy said. ... Bochy was optimistic that first baseman Brandon Belt and catcher Hector Sanchez would recover from concussions in time for the stretch drive.	UP NEXT	Following the completion of the suspended game, the Cubs and Giants finished their three-game series. Left-hander Travis Wood (7-10, 4.86 ERA) took the hill for Chicago against Madison Bumgarner (13-9, 3.14) in a 5-3 Giants win. The Giants now head to Washington for a weekend series with the Nationals, while the Cubs stay home to host the Baltimore Orioles.	FRIENDLY GESTURE	Bochy expressed gratitude to Cubs officials for their attempts to play the game in its entirety. Chicago's support might have played a role in the Giants' successful protest. "I don't know for a fact, but I think so because they were for finishing the game today," Bochy said. "I give my compliments to (president) Theo (Epstein) and their organization."	KONTOS GETS THE CALL	Earlier Thursday, the Giants recalled relief pitcher George Kontos from Triple-A Fresno to serve as the 26th man in the regularly scheduled game. He will return to the farm club after the game.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK -- Once again, Brandon McCarthy did a pretty nifty imitation of Masahiro Tanaka.	McCarthy pitched a four-hitter and the New York Yankees, trying to claw closer in the AL wild-card chase, avoided a three-game sweep by beating the Houston Astros 3-0 Thursday.	McCarthy improved to 5-2 with a 1.90 ERA in eight starts since the Yankees got him from Arizona in an early July trade. His first outing for New York came a day after Tanaka, off to an All-Star start as a major league rookie, pitched his last game before an elbow tear put him on the disabled list.	"He's been really, really good," Yankees manager Joe Girardi praised.	Maybe a bit of a surprise, too, considering McCarthy was 3-10 with a 5.01 ERA for the Diamondbacks.	"We knew he was a better pitcher than his numbers indicated," Girardi said.	McCarthy outpitched Dallas Keuchel (10-9) as they both threw complete games without a walk -- the game took only 2 hours, 7 minutes.	McCarthy said his "pitch mix is better" since joining the Yankees, fueling his confidence.	"In Arizona, I'm not getting out of jams, not performing well, and it starts to roll," he said.	New York won for just the third time in 10 games. Chase Headley hit an early two-run double and the Yankees backed McCarthy with flawless fielding.	The Yankees' fans also made fine plays -- sitting in the first row behind the Houston dugout, comedian Chris Rock wound up with a foul ball off the bat of Astros rookie Jon Singleton, and he gave the souvenir to a young boy as the crowd cheered.	McCarthy struck out eight in his fourth career shutout and first this season. The Yankees had been shut out in McCarthy's previous two starts.	Keuchel gave up seven hits and struck out five.	"I feel like I pitched just as good as McCarthy, but he was better today," Keuchel said.	This was the first nine-inning game where each pitcher threw a complete game without a walk since July 17, 2010, when Mark Buehrle of the White Sox and Carl Pavano of the Twins did it, STATS said.	The Astros had won three in a row overall. They were trying to become the first team to come into Yankee Stadium at least 20 games under .500 and sweep a series of three games or more since Milwaukee did it to close the 1972 season, STATS said.	The Yankees took a 3-0 lead in the second when a double by Martin Prado set up Headley's two-run double. Prado and Headley were the only two Yankees starters to previously hit against Keuchel.	Ichiro Suzuki added a sacrifice fly later in the inning.	Dexter Fowler hit a broken-bat double in the Houston fourth -- the barrel reached the infield dirt, the ball two-hopped off the right-field wall -- that put runners at second and third. Marc Krauss followed with a hard grounder off McCarthy's leg and, after taking a moment to locate the ball on the grass, the lanky pitcher zipped a throw to first that ended the threat.	McCarthy escaped another second-and-third jam in the seventh when Singleton struck out -- right after hitting a foul pop to the third-base side that Rock recovered -- and retiring Carlos Corporan on a flyball.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: Closer Chad Qualls didn't pitch in a save situation Wednesday night because of a back problem. Manager Bo Porter said the right-hander got treatment, but didn't want to comment on Qualls' availability.	Yankees: Tanaka is ready to throw to hitters on the side Saturday in his latest comeback effort from an elbow tear. The session will most likely be at Yankee Stadium. ... Slumping Carlos Beltran again didn't play because of his balky right elbow. He recently had his third cortisone shot. Girardi said the team should have a "good idea by Saturday where we're headed with this."	UP NEXT	Astros: RHP Brad Peacock (3-8, 5.47 ERA) starts Friday night at Cleveland vs. RHP Carlos Carrasco (5-4, 3.27). Peacock will be making his third start since returning from the minors.	Yankees: RHP Shane Greene (3-1, 2.91) starts at Yankee Stadium against White Sox LHP John Danks (9-8, 4.94) on Friday night. None of the Chicago hitters have ever faced Greene.	QUICK!	This was the Yankees' fastest nine-inning home game since June 18, 1996, when they beat Minnesota 2-0. ... This was the Astros' fastest game of the season.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Phil Hughes has been pitching with a cracked nail on his right index finger, a common side effect of the sharp curveball he throws. He's kept the nail intact with super glue.	The big righty has done a nice job of holding the Minnesota Twins' rotation together, too.	Kennys Vargas homered and sparked rallies with two other hits, leading Hughes and the Twins past Corey Kluber and the Cleveland Indians 4-1 Thursday.	Hughes (14-8) struck out eight over seven innings to forge a four-way tie for the American League lead in victories, with Rick Porcello, Max Scherzer and Scott Kazmir, and improved to 4-0 with a 1.32 ERA in four August starts.	"When you get on good stretches, everything's kind of working for you mechanically and your game plan, everything, just kind of falls into place," Hughes said.	Including that pesky finger nail.	"As long as it stays where it's at, I'll be fine," Hughes said.	Zach Walters, who has four home runs and six RBIs in nine games since joining the Indians, took Hughes deep in the fifth to tie the game. But Trevor Plouffe put the Twins back in front with a two-run double in the sixth inning after Vargas hit a one-out double.	Vargas singled in the eighth, and pinch-runner Eduardo Nunez scored on a double by Oswaldo Arcia. Then Glen Perkins pitched a perfect ninth for his 32nd save in 36 attempts for the Twins, denying the Indians their first sweep of a road series this season.	Kluber (13-7) had his winning streak stopped at six, despite eight strikeouts over seven innings, and the Indians fell six games behind Kansas City in the AL Central. They also dropped into sixth place in the AL wild-card race, still 4 1-2 games out of the second spot.	"Anytime you lose a ballgame it's disappointing, whether it be going for the sweep or the first game of the series. They all count the same in the long run," Kluber said.	Hughes avoided a walk for the 14th time in his 26 turns for the Twins and gave up just five hits.	"He's got one of those sneaky fastballs," Indians second baseman Jason Kipnis said.	Hughes has 148 strikeouts in 165 innings, putting him on pace to sail past his career high of 165 Ks with the New York Yankees in 2012.	"Change of scenery, whatever you want to call it, he's throwing the ball great," Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said.	STREAK SNAPPED	The home run by Vargas ended a scoreless streak of 20-plus innings and 64 outs for the Twins since they tallied five runs with their first five at-bats to start the series Tuesday. Kluber tried to throw a cut fastball outside that hit too much of the plate. "I don't want to say he got beat by it, but it looked like he was a little late on it, but he's just big enough and strong enough that he lifted it out of the park," Kluber said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: C Yan Gomes was replaced in the sixth inning by Roberto Perez because of illness. ... RF David Murphy, who was placed on the disabled list Aug. 10 due to abdominal muscle tightness on his right side, has resumed core workouts but still feels discomfort.	Twins: RHP Alex Meyer, the top pitching prospect in the organization, has been handled carefully with Triple-A Rochester because of shoulder trouble last season. Meyer has logged more than 123 innings already, but when asked if he could get a September call-up general manager Terry Ryan did not rule that out.	UP NEXT	Indians: RHP Carlos Carrasco (5-4, 3.27 ERA) starts Friday to open a three-game home series against Houston. RHP Brad Peacock (3-8, 5.47 ERA) pitches for the Astros. Carrasco takes his third turn since rejoining the rotation, following three months in the bullpen. He's pitched 12 scoreless innings, with five hits and no walks allowed over the last two starts.	Twins: Host Detroit this weekend for four games in three days, including a doubleheader. LHP Tommy Milone (6-4, 3.99 ERA) starts following the shortest outing (only four outs, seven run) of his career. LHP Robbie Ray (1-3, 5.33 ERA) pitches for the Tigers.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- The Tampa Bay Rays overcame a masterful performance by David Price.	Price allowed only a first-inning RBI triple to Brandon Guyer in his first start against his former team, and Alex Cobb and the Rays beat the Detroit Tigers 1-0 Thursday to avoid a three-game sweep.	"It's weird," Guyer said. "I've never seen a win like that."	Ben Zobrist reached on a throwing error by shortstop Eugenio Suarez and scored on Guyer's hit. Price then retired his final 23 batters, nine on strikeouts, to finish an eight-inning complete game.	Cobb (9-6) scattered two hits, walked two and struck out six over seven innings, improving to 7-0 in his last 10 starts. After Brad Boxberger worked out of an eighth-inning jam, Jake McGee got three outs for his 14th save and complete a four-hitter.	"What can I say, man?" Tampa Bay manager Joe Maddon said. "It really lived up to the billing prior to the game. Just happy we won."	Kevin Kiermaier, inserted as a defensive replacement in right field, made a diving catch on Rajai Davis' flare with a runner on second and one out in the eighth.	Price, traded to the Tigers as part of a three-team deal on July 31, got a standing ovation while taking his warmup throws before the bottom of the first.	"That's probably as good as I've pitched in a game that went my way," Price said. "It's the least amount of hits I've ever given up."	Price, taken first overall by Tampa Bay in the 2007 draft, got the save in the Rays' Game 7 victory over Boston in the 2008 AL championship series and was the 2012 AL Cy Young Award winner.	"All the stuff leading up to the game was awesome," Cobb said. "Definitely, David deserved everything he got from the crowd and leading up to the game with all the hype. Once it became game-time, the facts are we're streaking in the wrong direction a little bit and we definitely needed the win."	Tampa Bay had lost four in a row after becoming just the fourth big league team to reach .500 in the same season after dropping 18-games under the break-even mark. The Rays lead the AL with 16 shutouts.	"Classic pitchers' duel," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.	Alex Avila walked and Suarez singled to open the third, but Cobb got a double-play grounder from Davis and Ian Kinsler's grounder. The Tigers also failed score in the seventh when J.D. Martinez struck out and Nick Castellanos hit a flyball with runners on second and third.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: Miguel Cabrera was the DH one day after aggravating an old right ankle injury sliding at home plate Wednesday night. "Generally speaking he's fine," Ausmus said. ... RHP Justin Verlander (sore right shoulder) threw a light bullpen with "no issues" and is scheduled to start one game in Saturday's doubleheader at Minnesota. He walked into Ausmus' office after the mound session and high-fived the manager.	Rays: C Ryan Hanigan (oblique) is scheduled to play for Class-A Charlotte Friday.	ONE-HIT SHOW	The Rays are the first team since the 1915 St. Louis Terriers of the Federal League to win and lose a one-hit game during the same season. Tampa Bay allowed one hit in a 3-2 loss to Oakland on May 21.	UP NEXT	Tigers: Detroit heads to Minnesota for a four-game series that begins Friday night. The second AL wild-card leader trails Central Division-leading Kansas City by 1 1-2 games.	Rays: Tampa Bay opens a seven-game, two-city road trip Friday night against AL East-rival Toronto.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

WASHINGTON -- Denard Span and the Washington Nationals ran off with another victory.	Span scored from second on third baseman Jordan Pacheco's throwing error in the ninth inning, and the Nationals stretched their winning streak to 10 games with a 1-0 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Thursday.	"We just feel confident that somehow, some way we're going to find a way to inch off a victory," Span said.	Five of Washington's last six wins have come in its final at-bat of the game, and the win streak is tied for the franchise record. Kansas City is the only other team to win 10 consecutive games this year.	"It's not how you plan it," Nationals manager Matt Williams said.	Rafael Soriano (4-1) pitched a scoreless ninth for the Nationals, who swept three-game series against the New York Mets and Pittsburgh Pirates before winning all four games of this series.	Washington's ninth hit was a one-out single for Span against Oliver Perez (2-3). Evan Marshall then came in and Span swiped second. But Anthony Rendon followed with a chopper to third.	Pacheco's throw bounced off the dirt and into the first-base camera well, and Span was awarded home.	"That what's guys like me, speed guys, dream of," said Span, who set a career high with his 27th stolen base. "That's way more important than stealing two or three bags in the first five innings."	The Diamondbacks have lost six straight for the second time this season and dropped to 5-14 in August. Eight of Arizona's last 10 games have been decided by one run.	"I guess some losses are a little more difficult," first baseman Mark Trumbo said. "I think we battled as well as we could. Just didn't have too much offense to show for it."	The Nationals also struggled at the plate, going went 0 for 13 with runners in scoring position.	Gio Gonzalez pitched seven innings for Washington in his longest outing since July 26, and his first without an earned run since July 5. He allowed four hits and walked three while lowering his career ERA against Arizona to 1.33 in three starts.	"I just wanted to try and blend in with the rest of the rotation," said Gonzalez, who is 0-5 in his last eight starts. "You try not to stick out like a sore thumb."	Somehow, Wade Miley matched Gonzalez for 6 2-3 innings despite allowing eight hits and walking a season-high six batters.	Miley retired Adam LaRoche three times to end an inning -- twice on double plays -- before walking him to load the bases with two out in the seventh. Matt Stites got Wilson Ramos to fly out to right to end the threat.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: INF/OF Ryan Zimmerman (right hamstring strain) threw on the field for the first time since going on the disabled list July 23. There is no specific timetable for his return. "You have to use that muscle to throw," Williams said. "It's part of the strengthening process." ... INF/OF Steve Souza (right shoulder strain) joined Single-A Hagerstown to begin a rehab assignment. ... OF Nate McLouth was scheduled to have season-ending shoulder surgery Thursday, Williams said.	Diamondbacks: INF Chris Owings (left shoulder strain) will continue his rehab assignment at Triple-A Reno on Friday after going 4 for 7 in three games with Arizona's rookie league club. . OF A.J. Pollock (fractured right hand) took light batting practice Thursday.	UP NEXT:	Nationals: RHP Doug Fister (12-3, 2.20 ERA) looks for his third win in August in the first of a three-game set at home against San Francisco.	Diamondbacks: RHP Josh Collmenter (8-7, 4.31 ERA) will make his fifth career start against San Diego on Friday as Arizona begins an eight-game, 10-day homestand.	HARPER RESCUED	With two outs in the fifth, left fielder Bryce Harper made life more difficult for Gonzalez by over-running Miley's single, allowing Alfredo Marte to reach third, and then throwing to home as Miley took second.	Gonzalez walked Ender Inciarte to load the basis, but escaped on Cliff Pennington's popout to first.	FINALLY CAUGHT	Trumbo became just the second Diamondbacks runner in 12 attempts to be caught stealing when Wilson Ramos threw him out at second to end the sixth.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

BOSTON -- Hours after a devastating blow to the Los Angeles rotation, the Angels were reassured and relieved by rookie starter Matt Shoemaker.	Shoemaker threw 6 2/3 inning of no-hit ball and the Angels held on for a 2-0 victory against the Boston Red Sox on Thursday night, completing a four-game sweep and taking a two-game lead in the AL West.	"I didn't even really know or think about it until about the fifth or sixth," Shoemaker said. "It was just one of those things -- work and focus on pitches, who's coming up and then you realize where they are in the order."	The only hit Shoemaker (12-4) allowed was a double to Will Middlebrooks with two outs in the seventh. It was the only hit Boston got all night and welcome timing for the Angels, whose bullpen was weary with a cross-country flight ahead and huge series opening at Oakland on Friday.	The Angels were also dealing with confirmation that Garrett Richards (13-4) is out for the season with a knee injury that occurred Wednesday while covering first on a potential double play.	"I think it's really uplifting. I think it's important. There's going to be a lot of attention on our rotation obviously with Garrett not going to be part of it," manager Mike Scioscia said. "You can't say enough about what Matty did tonight."	Shoemaker struck out nine before a two-out walk to Mookie Betts in the eighth ended his night. It was the only walk for Shoemaker, who struck out nine. Jason Grilli pitched the ninth for his 12th save of the season and first with the Angels since coming to Los Angeles in a deal with Pittsburgh on June 27.	The Angels have won four straight and eight of nine, taking a two-game lead over the A's into this weekend's series at Oakland.	Josh Hamilton hit an RBI double in the first and Kole Calhoun hit a sacrifice fly in the seventh for Los Angeles' only other run. It was all the offense the Angels needed.	Shoemaker said he was thinking about Richards (13-5) as he warmed up Thursday.	"Up until gametime, it was really heavy on my mind. During the game, I was trying to focus on pitching which I think was good thing because that's what G does," he said. "It's a detrimental loss to us but we're all going to fight hard to pick him up and we're just going to keep getting stronger from it."	Rubby De La Rosa (4-5) pitched 6 2/3 innings, allowing two runs eight hits and getting himself out of a couple of jams as he tied his career high with eight strikeouts. Boston was able to cut off potential rallies for the Angels in the first and seventh, holding them to run in each and staying within reach throughout Shoemaker's no-hit bid.	"We couldn't get anything going against him. He's been very consistent for them," Boston manager John Farrell said.	CRUISING	After hitting Boston leadoff batter Brock Holt, Shoemaker retired 20 straight before facing Middlebrooks with two outs in the seventh.	Shoemaker is the first Angels rookie with 12 wins since Ervin Santana went 12-8 in 2005.	EARLY NIGHT	Angels 1B Albert Pujols was thrown out in the sixth after striking out and getting all the way back to the dugout.
