WASHINGTON --   Set aside the high - pressure task of postseason pitching that Chris Carpenter routinely masters for the St. Louis Cardinals and think about this : 	 Even the take - it - for - granted act of breathing feels odd on occasion now that he 's missing a rib and two neck muscles . 	 Taking the mound for only the fourth time in 2012 after complicated surgery to cure numbness on his right side , the 37 - year - old Carpenter spoiled the return of postseason baseball to Washington by throwing scoreless ball into the sixth inning , and the defending champion Cardinals beat the Nationals 8 - 0 Wednesday to take a 2 - 1 lead in their NL division series . 	 " To go from not being able to compete , and not only compete but help your team , to be able to be in this situation , " Carpenter said , " it 's pretty cool . " 	 Rookie Pete Kozma delivered a three - run homer , and a trio of relievers finished the shutout for the Cardinals , who can end the best - of - five series in Thursday 's Game 4 at Washington . Kyle Lohse will start for St. Louis . Ross Detwiler pitches for Washington , which is sticking to its long - stated plan of keeping Stephen Strasburg on the sideline the rest of the way . 	 " We 're not out of this , by a long shot , " Nationals manager Davey Johnson said . " Shoot , I 've had my back to worse walls than this . " 	 With the exception of Ian Desmond -- 3 for 4 on Wednesday , 7 for 12 in the series -- the Nationals ' hitters are struggling mightily . They 've scored a total of seven runs in the playoffs and went 0 for 8 with runners in scoring position and left 11 men on base in Game 3 . 	 Rookie phenom Bryce Harper 's woes , in particular , stand out : He went 0 for 5 , dropping to 1 for 15 . He went to the plate with an ash bat and no gloves in the first inning , tried wearing anti - glare tinted contact lenses on a sun - splashed afternoon -- nothing helped . 	 " Nothing I can do , " the 19 - year - old Harper said . " I just missed a couple . " 	 All in all , quite a damper on the day for a Nationals Park - record 45,017 red - wearing , towel - twirling fans witnessing the first major league postseason game in the nation 's capital in 79 years . They did n't have much to enjoy , in part because of the problems created by Nationals starter Edwin Jackson , who was on the Cardinals ' championship team a year ago . 	 " I did n't feel like I was out of rhythm . I did n't feel like I could n't throw strikes . I just missed across the plate with a couple of balls and it cost me , " Jackson said . 	 He gave up four consecutive hits in the second , the biggest being Kozma 's first - pitch homer into the first row in left off a 94 mph fastball to make it 4 - 0 . Kozma took over as the Cardinals ' everyday shortstop in September , replacing injured All - Star Rafael Furcal , and only had 72 at - bats during the regular season . 	 But he 's only the latest in a series of " Who 's that ? " stars of this postseason . 	 With the Capitol Dome rising beyond left field , the crowd of today was ready to root , root , root for the home team , breaking into chants of " Let 's go , Nats ! " after player introductions and again after a four - jet flyover . And , boy , did they boo -- when Cardinals outfielder Jon Jay was announced as the game 's first batter , when first - base umpire Jim Joyce missed a call , when catcher Yadier Molina trotted to chat with Carpenter , even when Carpenter paused between pitches to tie his red - and - gray right shoe . 	 " Carp 's been a dominant pitcher his whole career . Big - game pitcher . He showed up , " Washington 's Jayson Werth said . " He pitched well today . We had him in some spots . We had him on the ropes a couple of times . We were just one bloop away from a totally different ballgame . " 	 The Cardinals won 10 fewer games than the majors - best Nationals this season and finished second in the NL Central , nine games behind Cincinnati , sneaking into the postseason as the league 's second wild - card under this year 's new format . But the Cardinals become a different bunch in the high - pressure playoffs -- no matter that slugger Albert Pujols and manager Tony La Russa are no longer around . 	 Carpenter still is , even though even he did n't expect to be pitching this year when he encountered problems during spring training and needed what Cardinals manager Mike Matheny termed a " radical " operation in July to correct a nerve problem . 	 " Everyone had written him off , kind of , " Jay said . " It could have been a season - ending injury , where he could have just gone home and said , ` See you later . " 	 The top rib on Carpenter 's right side was removed , along with muscles that were constricting blood flow up there . After Wednesday 's game , he squeezed his big right hand with his left , explaining , " Basically , my nerves were getting squished down by all the scar tissue and all the muscles and everything . There was n't enough space . " 	 Still adjusting to the way breathing feels different , he returned Sept. 21 , going 0 - 2 in three starts totaling 17 innings , so it was n't clear how he 'd fare Wednesday . 	 Yeah , right . 	 Carpenter allowed seven hits and walked two across his 5 2/3 innings to improve to 10 - 2 over his career in the postseason . That includes a 4 - 0 mark while helping another group of wild - card Cardinals take the title in the 2011 World Series , when he won Game 7 against Texas . 	 The 10 victories tie Carpenter for seventh - most , behind Andy Pettitte 's record 19 . 	 " If the baseball world does n't know what an amazing competitor he is by now , they have n't been paying any attention , " Cardinals left fielder Matt Holliday said . 	 Carpenter collected a pair of hits , including a double off the wall in the fifth that was about a foot or two away from being a homer . When he reached second base , he raised his right fist . 	 Earlier , Carpenter stepped to the plate for his first at - bat and chatted with umpire Joe West . 	 " I say hello to him . And he said hello back , and he talked about what a beautiful day it was to play a baseball game . And I was like , ` You ai n't kidding , " Carpenter recounted . " Beautiful weather . The crowd is going crazy . ... There 's no question you take time to reflect on that . " 	 Game notes 	  Holliday fouled a ball off his left leg in the eighth , stayed in to deliver a two - run single , then left for a pinch runner . ... Lohse beat the Braves in the wild - card game . ... Detwiler will be making the first postseason appearance of his career . His last regular - season start also came against the Cardinals , and he went only 2 1/3 innings , giving up seven runs . ... Wednesday was the 88th anniversary of Washington 's only World Series championship , won by the Senators on Oct. 10 , 1924 . 	 In a free - agent field filled with future Hall of Famers , Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter . 	 Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox . 	 Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr. 's career . 	 Former Boston Red Sox left - hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five - year deal worth $ 77 million , sources confirmed to ESPN . 	 From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right , this is your one - stop shop as baseball 's 2021 hardware is handed out . 	 Even Shohei Ohtani , arguably the best player in the major leagues , feels down at times , particularly when his team is n't winning .

CINCINNATI -- Angel Pagan connects on the second pitch of the game . A Giants team that finished last in homers goes on to hit three . Tim Lincecum pitches like a two - time Cy Young winner -- this time , out of the bullpen . 	 So many unusual things moved San Francisco to the verge of an unprecedented comeback . 	 Pagan hit the first leadoff homer in Giants postseason history , and Gregor Blanco and Pablo Sandoval connected later for an 8 - 3 victory over the Cincinnati Reds on Wednesday that evened their NL Division Series at 2 - 2 . 	 No team has recovered from a 2 - 0 deficit in a best - of - five series by winning three on the road , according to STATS LLC . This one can do it with a victory on Thursday at Great American Ball Park . 	 " Thanks to the win today , there will be a tomorrow , " Pagan said . " And we are ready for that . " 	 Matt Cain , who lost the series opener and has yet to beat the Reds in three tries this season , will start Game 5 against Mat Latos . 	 Facing elimination , the Giants ' slumping hitters came out swinging and extended Cincinnati 's playoff misery . The Reds have n't won a postseason game at home in 17 years . 	 One thing in the Reds ' favor -- they have n't dropped three straight at home all season . 	 " I 'd like to think that we still have the advantage , " Reds outfielder Jay Bruce said . " We 're at home . I expect Mat to come up with a big game . I 'm looking forward to it . " 	 So are the Giants , who were down after losing the first two games at home while getting outscored 14 - 2 . They barely were able to get a hit , let alone a win . 	 The pressure pulled them closer . Hunter Pence gathered them for inspirational speeches before the two games in Cincinnati , challenging them to play like champions . 	 " We feel good , " NL batting champion Buster Posey said . " When you 're down 0 - 2 , you see what you 're made of . We 're not done . " 	 It was n't all about the offense . San Francisco 's overlooked Cy Young winner played a starring role , too . 	 Lincecum was relegated to the bullpen for the playoff series because of his dreary season -- 15 losses , 17 wild pitches . He entered in the fourth inning , pitched out of a threat that kept the Giants up 3 - 2 , and kept going . The right - hander struck out six while allowing just one run in 4 1/3 innings . 	 " I knew he would play a huge role in this , " manager Bruce Bochy said . " And I know of other situations where starters have been in the ' pen and really done a great job to help their team win . We knew Timmy would play a critical role in the series like he did tonight . " 	 The Reds were hoping to start ace Johnny Cueto , but had to drop him off the roster a few hours before Wednesday 's first pitch because he still was bothered by a strained muscle in his right side . He wo n't be available if Cincinnati wins Game 5 and reaches the NL Championship Series . 	 The way the Giants have started hitting , that 's now in doubt . 	 San Francisco managed only four runs in the first three games of the series . The Giants avoided the sweep by pulling out a 2 - 1 win in 10 innings on Tuesday night with the help of a passed ball and an error by third baseman Scott Rolen . 	 They broke out against Mike Leake , who replaced Cueto and had a rough time . Leake threw his first career complete game in San Francisco on June 29 and was 3 - 0 career against the Giants . 	 Pagan homered to start it off for the Giants . Blanco hit a two - run shot in the second . The Giants had another breakthrough in the fifth , when back - to - back doubles by Joaquin Arias and Pagan ended an 0 - for-14 slump with runners in scoring position during the series . 	 Sandoval 's two - run shot in the seventh made it 8 - 3 , matched the Giants ' season high for homers and drew loud boos from the crowd of 44,375 -- the third - largest at Great American Ball Park . Fans quietly settled into their seats and used their white rally towels as lap warmers against the evening chill . 	 The Giants normally do n't hit many homers -- only 103 during the season , fewest in the majors . They 're only the seventh team since 1900 to reach the playoffs after finishing last in the majors in homers . 	 While the offense went to work , Lincecum bailed out the bullpen . 	 Bochy did n't hesitate to put the guys he wanted on the mound , using four pitchers in the first four innings . Lincecum settled things down , giving up only two hits in his second relief appearance of the series . 	 He threw 42 strikes out of 55 pitches and even batted twice -- just like a starter . 	 " The last two games , it 's been about scratching and leaving it on the field , " Lincecum said . 	 Bochy decided to go with left - hander Barry Zito over Lincecum for Game 4 because he was better down the stretch . Zito was left off the postseason roster when San Francisco won the World Series in 2010 , but finished the regular season with seven straight wins . 	 The left - hander lasted only 2 2/3 innings , his shortest career outing in the postseason . On came Lincecum to save the day . 	 The Reds finished with the second - best record in the majors at 97 - 65 , one game behind Washington . The rotation was the foundation of their championship season , with all five starters making it through healthy -- a franchise first . 	 Things changed dramatically when Cueto had to leave the first inning of the playoff series opener on Saturday with the injury . The Reds made it through that game with Latos filling in for a 5 - 2 victory , but could n't win without him on Wednesday . 	 The Reds honored RHP Homer Bailey on the field before the game for his no - hitter in Pittsburgh on Sept. 28 , presenting him and C Ryan Hanigan with framed photo montages . ... It was Zito 's shortest outing since he lasted 2 1 - 3 innings on Aug. 29 at Houston . The Giants won it 6 - 4 . ... San Francisco has won each of Zito 's last 12 starts . ... Leake lasted 4 1 - 3 innings , giving up six hits and five runs . ... The Giants hit three homers in a game eight times during the regular season . 	 Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year . 	 From MVP to Cy Young and more , this is your one - stop shop as baseball 's 2021 hardware is handed out . 	 Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season , leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR . 	 Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India 's 2021 campaign . 	 Julio Lugo , who played for seven teams in a 12 - year major league career , has died . He was 45 . 	 Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers .

NEW YORK --   The highest paid player in baseball could only sit and watch when Raul Ibanez pinch hit for him and tied the game with a bottom - of - the - ninth home run . 	 Alex Rodriguez had another good view from the dugout three innings later when Ibanez homered to win it . 	 Saved by manager Joe Girardi 's gutsy move -- and Ibanez 's big swings -- the New York Yankees rallied for a stunning 3 - 2 win in the 12th inning over the Baltimore Orioles on Wednesday night for a 2 - 1 lead in their best - of - five AL Division Series . 	 " You 're going to be asked a lot of questions if it does n't work , " Girardi said . 	 The slumping Rodriguez , among the greatest power hitters in history , offered no complaint , telling Girardi : " Joe , you got ta do exactly what you got ta do . " 	 " Maybe 10 years ago , I would have reacted in a much different way , " A - Rod said . 	 Ibanez then stepped up and hit a tying , solo shot to right - center with one out in the ninth off major league saves leader Jim Johnson to make it 2 - 2 . 	 Yankees fans had been howling this week for Girardi to drop Rodriguez out of the No . 3 spot in the batting order . But Girardi was reluctant to move his fading slugger down in the lineup . 	 Until he took him all the way out . 	 " You have to make some decisions sometimes that are tough decisions . I just had a gut feeling , " Girardi said . 	 Rodriguez has 647 career home runs -- he 's chasing the all - time record of 762 by Barry Bonds -- and is making $ 29 million this year . But he was just 1 for 12 with no RBIs and seven strikeouts in this series when Girardi pulled him . 	 " It kind of caught me off - guard , hitting for a guy who 's half - a - billionaire , " Orioles center fielder Adam Jones said . 	 It was the first time Rodriguez had ever been pinch hit for in a postseason game , according to STATS LLC . 	 And it worked . 	 Rodriguez immediately turned to injured Yankees closer Mariano Rivera , raised one arm , then both arms and traded high - fives with his star teammate . When Ibanez returned to the bench , Rodriguez was the first player to greet him . 	 " He said great job . A - Rod is a great teammate and great team player , " Ibanez said . " He 's the first one on the top step congratulating you . It 's about winning . It 's about the Yankees and continuing . " 	 Ibanez remained in the game and connected on the first pitch from Brian Matusz in the 12th . 	 Ibanez became the first player to homer twice in a postseason game in which he did n't start , STATS said . 	 Phil Hughes will try to clinch it for the Yankees on Thursday night in Game 4 . Joe Saunders will start for Baltimore . 	 Baltimore had won 16 straight extra - inning games , and had been 76 - 0 when leading after seven before the Yankees stung them . 	 " It was a great experience . We do it as a team . We stay after it , " Ibanez said . " I 'm blessed to come up and have the opportunity like that . We do it together . It 's about a team and about winning . " 	 The brash , young Orioles appeared poised to move within a win of their first trip to the AL Championship Series since 1997 before the Yankees ' comeback . 	 Ibanez hit a 1 - 0 pitch into the seats in the ninth , setting off a raucous celebration in what had been a demoralized Yankee Stadium crowd . 	 After their 10 - game July lead was cut to zero in early September , the Yankees repelled every Orioles charge . The teams were tied 10 times in the final month but New York ended up atop the division . 	 New York won the opener in Baltimore scoring five runs in the ninth off Johnson . The Orioles won Game 2 and rode Miguel Gonzalez 's pretty performance to a 2 - 1 lead in the ninth . 	 But the Yankees limited Baltimore to one hit after 20 - year - old Manny Machado homered in the fifth . Ryan Flaherty homered earlier for the Orioles . 	 Robert Andino was doubled off second after leading off the Baltimore ninth with a single and advancing on a sacrifice . 	 Boone Logan got one out in relief of Hiroki Kuroda , who gave up two solo homers in 8 1 - 3 innings . Closer Rafael Soriano pitched 1 1/3 innings and David Robertson went two , finishing off his outing by bumping into and tagging Andino to end the top of the 12th . 	 Derek Jeter tied the score with an RBI triple in the third for the Yankees . Jeter , limping after fouling a ball off his foot , came out after eight innings . He says we will be able to play Thursday . 	 Rivera threw out the ceremonial first pitch . 	 Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year . 	 From MVP to Cy Young and more , this is your one - stop shop as baseball 's 2021 hardware is handed out . 	 Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season , leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR . 	 Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India 's 2021 campaign . 	 Julio Lugo , who played for seven teams in a 12 - year major league career , has died . He was 45 . 	 Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers .

OAKLAND , Calif. --   After a season filled with dramatic comebacks and memorable endings , the Oakland Athletics now expect the unexpected . 	 Two runs down and three outs away from their season ending , the A 's staged their most magical finish yet . 	 Seth Smith hit a game - tying two - run double off closer Jose Valverde in the ninth inning and Coco Crisp capped Oakland 's rally with a two - out RBI single as the A 's staved off elimination for a second straight night with a 4 - 3 victory over the Detroit Tigers in Game 4 on Wednesday night . 	 " We 've heard a lot of people say we 're not smart enough to know when to lose a game like most people do , " said Josh Reddick , who started the rally with a single . " We 've been battling ' til the 27th out all year and we 're not going to stop now . " 	 The A 's rode a major league - leading 14 walk - off wins in the regular season to an improbable AL West title . Those paled in comparison to No . 15 , which set up a win - or - go - home Game 5 against Justin Verlander and the Tigers . 	 Reddick led off the ninth with a single just under the glove of diving second baseman Omar Infante . Josh Donaldson followed with a double off the wall in left - center and both runners scored on Smith 's double . 	 " There 's a confidence , " manager Bob Melvin said . " We 've done it so many times , so there 's always going to be that confidence until we make that last out . " 	 Two outs later , Crisp lined a single and Smith scored easily when right fielder Avisail Garcia could n't handle the ball . 	 That set off a raucous celebration near first base as the A 's poured out of the dugout to mob Crisp , who was the recipient of a whipped cream pie that became a regular occurrence in this remarkable season in Oakland . This marked the second time the A 's erased a two - run deficit in the ninth inning to win a postseason game , the other coming in Game 5 of the 1929 World Series . 	 " It 's amazing , " Crisp said . " The guys in front of me obviously did a fantastic job of getting on base . ... This club , we 've been battling the whole year , giving 100 percent , and these walk - offs have been our MO this year . " 	 Ryan Cook retired four batters for the win . 	 The A 's , who have the lowest payroll in baseball , need just one more surprising result to win their second postseason series since 1990 . Rookie Jarrod Parker will take the mound in Game 5 on Thursday night against Verlander , the reigning AL Cy Young winner and MVP . 	 " That 's why this is the greatest game of all , " Tigers manager Jim Leyland said . " It looked like we were going to get it . We did n't do it . We did n't quite get the 27 outs , that 's part of the game . You get tested all the time in this game . And this is a good test . " 	 The Tigers looked to be in prime position to advance to their second straight ALCS and have a rested Verlander for Game 1 when they took a 3 - 1 lead into the ninth behind a strong start from Max Scherzer and a homer from Prince Fielder . 	 Now the A 's are one win away from repeating last week 's three - game sweep of Texas that gave them the AL West title on the final day of the regular season . After losing the first two games in Detroit , the A 's won 2 - 0 in Game 3 and are looking to become the eighth team to rally from two games down to win a best - of - five series . 	 The San Francisco Giants will have a shot to do it , as well , earlier Thursday when they face Cincinnati in Game 5 of their NL division series . 	 Scherzer , who was dealing with shoulder , deltoid and ankle injuries late in the season , looked in top form against the A 's . He allowed just one baserunner in the first four innings and struck out seven of the first 15 batters before running into his first trouble in the fifth . 	 Smith worked a two - out walk and went to third on Derek Norris ' opposite - field blooper down the right - field line . But Scherzer responded by getting Cliff Pennington to chase an offspeed pitch in the dirt for his eighth strikeout . 	 The A 's finally got to Scherzer for an unearned run in the sixth . Crisp reached when Fielder misplayed a hard grounder to first base into a two - base error . Crisp advanced on a wild pitch and scored on Stephen Drew 's double to right - center . But the A 's ran themselves out of a potential big inning when third - base coach Mike Gallego waved Drew around to third , where he was easily caught on the relay for the first out . 	 Octavio Dotel and Phil Coke both retired a batter to get out of the sixth and Al Alburquerque pitched a perfect seventh in his first appearance since his memorable kiss of the baseball on a comebacker by Yoenis Cespedes in Game 2 . Joaquin Benoit escaped a first - and - second jam in the eighth by striking out Brandon Moss , but Valverde could n't close it . 	 " This is the toughest moment in my whole career , " Valverde said . " I had everything . These guys hit it . There 's nothing I can do . " 	 Game notes 	  This is the seventh postseason walk - off win for the A 's in franchise history and first since Ramon Hernandez won it with a squeeze bunt in the 2003 division series against Boston . ... A.J. Griffin allowed two runs in five - plus innings . He was the third Oakland rookie pitcher to start a game this series , the most ever by a team in a single postseason . The A 's used just two rookie starting pitchers in 147 postseason games before this year : Joe Bush in the 1913 World Series and Barry Zito in the 2000 division series . ... Triple Crown winner Miguel Cabrera has not driven in a run in the series . ... Reddick has struck out eight times in the four games , setting an Oakland record for most in a postseason series . 	 From MVP to Cy Young and more , this is your one - stop shop as baseball 's 2021 hardware is handed out . 	 Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year . 	 The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third - base coach on Monday . 	 Detroit got a jump - start on the winter signings , landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez . We break down the deal . 	 In a free - agent field filled with future Hall of Famers , Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter . 	 Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox .

CINCINNATI --   Not just any comeback would get San Francisco back to playing for a pennant . It would take one of Giant proportions . 	 And Buster Posey believed it could happen . Even after the Giants left the West Coast down two games , the National League batting champion insisted his team could pull it off , despite the long odds . 	 With one swing , he got everyone else believing it , too . 	 Posey hit the third grand slam in Giants ' postseason history Thursday , and San Francisco pulled off an unprecedented revival , moving into the championship series with a 6 - 4 victory over the Cincinnati Reds . 	 " You do n't want to be in a lose - and - you're - out scenario , " reliever Jeremy Affeldt said , wearing a brace on his left wrist so he did n't hurt it in the champagne - flavored clubhouse celebration . " We 've been in that situation for three days . We 're probably going to sleep well tonight . " 	 They 'll play either Washington or St. Louis for the NL pennant , Sunday , not caring at all who they face . 	 " We could go up against anybody at any time , " shortstop Brandon Crawford said . " Being down 2 - 0 and coming back and winning three at their place , it 's an unbelievable feeling . " 	 Game 1 of the NL championship series will be Sunday , either in Washington against the Nationals or in San Francisco vs. the Cardinals . In the meantime , the Giants will stay in Cincinnati until their next opponent is determined Friday night when the Cards and Nats play Game 5 . 	 The Giants became the first NL team to overcome a 2 - 0 deficit in the division series , which began in 1995 . Major League Baseball 's changed playoff format this season allowed them to become the first to take a best - of - five by winning the last three on the road . 	 Posey 's second career grand slam off Mat Latos put the Giants up 6 - 0 in the fifth and sparked a joyous scrum in the San Francisco dugout . The ball smacked off the front of the upper deck in left field , just above Latos ' name on the video board . 	 For the first time in the series , the Giants could exhale . 	 " I do n't think anybody gave up , " Posey said . 	 Will Clark , in the 1989 NLCS , and Chuck Hiller , in the 1962 World Series , hit the other Giants slams in the postseason . 	 Matt Cain and the bullpen held on , with more help from Posey . The All - Star catcher threw out Jay Bruce at third base to snuff out a sixth - inning rally that cut it to 6 - 3 . The Giants had a pair of diving catches that preserved the lead in the eighth . 	 There was more drama in the ninth . Ryan Ludwick singled home a run off Sergio Romo . With two runners aboard , Romo fanned Scott Rolen to end it . 	 The Giants raised their arms , hugged and huddled by the side of the mound , bouncing in unison . 	 " It was a spectacular moment , " outfielder Hunter Pence said . 	 In Cincinnati , the home - field meltdown had a sickeningly familiar feeling . The Reds have n't won a home playoff game in 17 years . After taking the first two on the West Coast , all they needed was one more at home , where they had n't dropped three straight all season . 	 " You get tired of the disappointments , but then you get over it , " manager Dusty Baker said . " It hurts big - time . " 	 Once Posey connected , the Reds were the ones facing a steep comeback . They 've never overcome a six - run deficit in the playoffs , according to STATS LLC . 	 Could n't do it this time , either . 	 " Buster Posey 's swing was a series - changer , " said Reds star Joey Votto , standing on second base when the game ended . " That made it very difficult to come back . You know they 're going to throw the kitchen sink at us . " 	 The Giants never trailed in any of their three postseason series when they won it all in 2010 . They beat the Braves 3 - 1 in the division series , knocked out the Phillies 4 - 2 for the NL title , then took four of five from Texas for their sixth World Series title and their first since they moved from New York to San Francisco in 1958 . 	 They really had to scramble this season to get another shot at it . 	 The bullpen took a huge hit when closer Brian Wilson blew out his elbow , and that was just the start . All - Star Game MVP Melky Cabrera got a 50 - game suspension in August after a positive testosterone test , taking a .346 hitter out of their lineup . The Giants have decided not to bring him back , even though he 's eligible to return for the NLCS . 	 Two - time Cy Young winner Tim Lincecum pitched so poorly -- 15 losses -- that he got relegated to the bullpen for the division series . 	 And do n't forget that Posey was coming off a broken leg that wiped out most of his 2011 season , making a great comeback of his own . 	 " Unreal , " Romo said , with champagne dripping off his scraggly beard . " That guy 's definitely the MVP of our team . We believe he 's the MVP of the league . We would n't be here without him , that 's for dang sure . He 's the one that 's been the face of the team all season long . What a great story with all he 's been through last year . " 	 The Reds wo n't forget the first inning of the series , when everything changed . Ace Johnny Cueto pulled muscles in his right side and had to leave the game . He wound up getting dropped from the playoff roster because of the injury . 	 Latos pulled them through that opening game , pitching in relief on short rest for a 5 - 2 win . Latos came to Cincinnati from the Padres at a high price -- pitcher Edinson Volquez and three former high draft picks -- and with a clear purpose in the offseason . He was expected to take them to the next level . 	 The right - hander allowed three hits through the first four innings , then fell apart in the fifth . Crawford had an RBI triple and scored on rookie shortstop Zack Cozart 's error . A four - pitch walk and a single loaded the bases for Posey . 	 As soon as he connected , Reds catcher Ryan Hanigan stood and turned away , unable to watch the ball head for the seats . 	 Cincinnati 's 17 - year history of playoff futility was about to go on . 	 Game notes 	  Posey 's other career grand slam came on July 7 , 2010 at Milwaukee . ... The Reds are 3 - 3 in winner - take - all playoff games , including 1 - 2 in best - of - five series and 2 - 1 in best - of - seven series . .. Teams that lose the first two games in a best - of - five series are 7 - 59 all - time . ... Cain gave up six hits and three runs in 6 2/3 innings , the longest appearance by a Giants starter during the series . 	 Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year . 	 From MVP to Cy Young and more , this is your one - stop shop as baseball 's 2021 hardware is handed out . 	 Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season , leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR . 	 Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India 's 2021 campaign . 	 Julio Lugo , who played for seven teams in a 12 - year major league career , has died . He was 45 . 	 Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers .

WASHINGTON --   Lance Lynn needed only a few words to describe a 13 - pitch at - bat . 	 " Three - two heater . He beat me . " 	 There were more questions for the St. Louis Cardinals reliever , of course , but the answers were more or less the same . He went mano - a - mano with Jayson Werth in the bottom of the ninth inning of a playoff game , losing the battle when the Washington leadoff hitter put the baker 's dozen offering off the back wall of the visitors dugout beyond left field . 	 " Everyone in the stadium knew what I was throwing there , " Lynn said . " Tip your cap to him . The guy can play , and he beat me . " 	 The Nationals ' 2 - 1 win Thursday in Game 4 kept the Cardinals from clinching the NL Division Series , and now there will be a decisive Game 5 in Washington on Friday . It 'll be hard to top this one -- with Werth going strike , strike , ball , ball , foul , foul , foul , foul , foul , foul , ball and foul before launching the hit that had him circling the bases , tossing his helmet high and leaping into a pile of teammates at home plate . 	 " He battled that whole at - bat , and I was making good pitches , making my pitches , and you know , he won , " Lynn said . " It was just a matter of time . I was challenging him , and he was up for it . " 	 It 's the kind of playoff moment all at Nationals Park will remember for a long time . The tension was building with each of the 13 pitches , the sellout crowd ready to explode . 	 " I guess for the pitcher and the hitter , the pressure on them have to be unbelievable , " Cardinals star Carlos Beltran said . " Because Werth is battling , and our pitcher 's trying to get him out . He ended up winning that battle right there , but we have one more day . " 	 The Cardinals wasted a stellar effort by Kyle Lohse , who allowed just two hits over seven innings with five strikeouts and a walk , his only miscue coming on Adam LaRoche 's dead - center homer in the second . 	 Mitchell Boggs handled the eighth , and rookie manager Mike Matheny opted to go with Lynn -- a starter relegated to the bullpen for this series -- rather than closer Jason Motte with the score tied in the ninth . 	 " If we were at home , it would have been a very easy decision to bring in Motte , " Matheny said . " We are looking at a team that had every save of our season by Jason Motte , and we take a lead there at any point ( in extra innings ) , you 're asking one of our guys , especially one of our young guys , who have never been in that situation to come in and close out a game , and that 's a lot to ask . 	 " Had a lot of confidence in Lance . He came in throwing the ball well . Werth just put together a very good at - bat . " 	 The Cardinals had scored a combined 20 runs in Games 2 and 3 , but they managed only one unearned tally against Nationals starter Ross Detwiler . Pete Kozma circled the bases in the second inning by way of a walk , a sacrifice bunt , a booted grounder by shortstop Ian Desmond and a sacrifice fly . 	 Detwiler allowed three hits over six innings -- the type of performance Washington needed after Gio Gonzalez , Jordan Zimmermann and Edwin Jackson were far from their best in Games 1 - 3 , respectively . 	 It got worse for the Cardinals against the Nationals ' relievers . Zimmerman , the Game 2 loser , struck out the side in the seventh in his first career relief appearance , and Tyler Clippard also notched three Ks in the eighth . Drew Storen got two more strikeouts in the ninth before Desmond ended the inning with a nice , stumble - to - the - ground catch of a deep popup by pinch hitter Matt Carpenter . 	 Although St. Louis is a wild - card team facing the club with the best record in baseball in the regular season , the intangibles should belong to the visitors Friday . While nearly to a man -- Werth being an exception -- the young Nationals are new to this sort of thing , the Cardinals have quite the postseason pedigree : In the past two years , St. Louis is 5 - 0 in games where it faces elimination , including must - have victories in Games 6 and 7 of the 2011 World Series against the Texas Rangers . 	 " We 've got a lot of veterans in this clubhouse that have been in big spots before and have lost games and know how to bounce back , " second baseman Daniel Descalso said . " We 've done a good job of that lately , and we 're going to try to do it again tomorrow . " 	 On the mound will be Adam Wainwright , a 14 - game winner who was a spectator during last year 's title run while recovering from elbow reconstruction surgery . 	 " Of course I wish we would have won tonight , but you know what ? This is every pitcher 's dream , I would say , " said Wainwright , who pitched well in Game 1 of this series but did n't get the decision . " Every competitor 's dream is to go in huge moments like that , so I look forward to the challenge . " 	 Game notes 	  In Game 3 on Wednesday , Cardinals RHP Chris Carpenter became only the second starting pitcher in baseball history to win a postseason game after not having any wins during the regular season , according to STATS LLC . The other ? Virgil Trucks , who won Game 2 of the 1945 World Series for the Tigers against the Cubs . STATS said 14 relievers have done it . Carpenter missed most of the season , making his debut on Sept. 21 after surgery to cure numbness on his right side . He made only three starts in the regular season , going 0 - 2 . ... Home - plate umpire Jim Joyce , who missed a call at first base in Game 3 , was booed during Thursday 's pregame introductions . 	 Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr. 's career . 	 Former Boston Red Sox left - hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five - year deal worth $ 77 million , sources confirmed to ESPN . 	 From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right , this is your one - stop shop as baseball 's 2021 hardware is handed out . 	 Even Shohei Ohtani , arguably the best player in the major leagues , feels down at times , particularly when his team is n't winning . 	 The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash . 	 Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair , nailing the dunk tank target in one try .

NEW YORK --   These Birds do n't rattle easily . 	 A day after a demoralizing defeat , the Baltimore Orioles won a test of wills and Game 4 of the AL division series , bouncing back to outlast the New York Yankees 2 - 1 in 13 innings Thursday night on J.J. Hardy 's RBI double . 	 Now , after playing past midnight to even things , the Orioles will get a chance to finally overtake the Yankees in a winner - take - all Game 5 on Friday . The teams have already split 22 games this year , and it all comes down this : a matchup for a spot in the AL championship series against Detroit . 	 " We just kept telling ourselves , ' This is not the last night of the season , ' " Hardy said . 	 Game 1 winner CC Sabathia was set to pitch the deciding game for the Yankees against Jason Hammel . 	 With the innings and hours piling up , the Orioles were 0 - for-8 with runners in scoring position until Hardy doubled off David Phelps with one out to score Manny Machado , who had doubled . 	 " There has n't been a whole lot of opportunities to score runs , " Hardy said , " so when there are those opportunities , I think we 're trying a little bit too hard . " 	 Phelps had relieved in the 12th after Joba Chamberlain was hit by a flying broken bat , forcing him to leave with a bruised right elbow . 	 Jim Johnson returned from allowing Raul Ibanez 's pinch - hit homer in the ninth inning Wednesday to earn his second save in the series with a perfect 13th . 	 " I do n't take for granted at any time what these guys are accomplishing so far , " Orioles manager Buck Showalter said . " They know that . I have so much respect for our guys . " 	 Hours after learning Joe Girardi had kept quiet that his father died last Saturday , the Yankees could n't rally late . This time , Girardi called upon Eric Chavez to pinch - hit for slumping Alex Rodriguez . He lined out to third base to end it . 	 Baltimore 's win pushed all four division series to five games for the first time since the round began in 1995 . 	 The Orioles have been pursuing the Yankees all season , cutting a 10 - game deficit in July to zero in early September . Baltimore and New York were tied 10 times atop the East in the final month , but the Yankees never completely relinquished the lead and wrapped up the division on the final night of the regular season . 	 Baltimore advanced to the division series with a win over the West champion Texas Rangers in the wild - card playoff . 	 " You know , we played an elimination game last week to start our postseason . It 's like a Game 7 , " reliever Darren O'Day said . " I think we all got as much playoff experience as we need , especially considering how many times we 've played them this year . And tonight was an elimination game and tomorrow will be another one . " 	 After dropping Game 1 , the Orioles rebounded with another one - run win in a season in which they had the best record in the majors in such games at 29 - 9 . But they lost in stunning fashion in 12 innings Wednesday night , when Ibanez homered twice in his two at - bats after pinch - hitting for Rodriguez . 	 Did n't affect these late - inning savants . 	 They came right back Thursday for their first win in extras against the Yankees this year . They also lost twice to New York in extra innings in the regular season before going on a run of 16 straight wins after the ninth inning . 	 It was n't easy , though . Nate McLouth homered off Phil Hughes to start the fifth , but Baltimore wasted three shots with a runner on third base in the first four innings . They struggled against New York 's bullpen . 	 McLouth also made a leaping catch against the left - field wall to save a run . 	 Matt Wieters knocked Chamberlain out of the game with a broken - bat single to lead off the 12th inning that struck his surgically repaired right elbow . Fans sat silent as Chamberlain bent over in pain . He was checked out by trainer Steve Donahue and Girardi . 	 Chamberlain tested the elbow with three pitches before walking off the field . X - rays were negative . He 's not sure if he 'll be available for Game 5 . 	 " You kind of see how it feels and go from there , " Chamberlain said . " It 's definitely not as stiff as it was when it first happened . " 	 Many of the Orioles gathered near their bat rack in the dugout for an impromptu cheer before the 13th and Machado then led off with a double . 	 One out later , Hardy hit a one - bouncer off the wall in left field for his first RBI of the series . 	 The hit came after another Orioles quirk -- the players held Gatorade bottles and wiggled them in the dugout , trying to conjure up a rally . 	 Showalter professed confidence in the 51 - save Johnson before the game . He backed it up by calling on him for his fourth appearance of the series . He lost the opener after giving up five runs in the ninth and sandwiched saves around his trying homer to Ibanez . 	 Seven Baltimore relievers pitched 7 1/3 innings of four - hit ball . 	 " There 's really good pitching , " Girardi said . " You 're seeing some really good pitching in these four games . " 	 Baltimore needs it because their top hitters are missing a lot . Mark Reynolds is 3 - for-16 . Hardy is 3 - for-18 . Wieters is 2 - for-17 and Adam Jones is 2 - for-19 . 	 The Yankees held a moment of silence for Girardi 's dad , Jerry , who died Saturday at 81 and had a long bout with Alzheimer 's . Joe Girardi stood alone in front of the Yankees dugout and wiped his eyes after the national anthem . He blew a kiss to someone in the stands , then fist bumped several coaches and players . 	 Facing elimination for the second time this postseason , Showalter turned again to Joe Saunders . Acquired by Baltimore on Aug. 26 from Arizona , Saunders pitched 5 2/3 innings of one - run ball in the wild - card win over Texas . 	 He was just as crafty against New York , engaging with Phil Hughes in a duel of who could get out of the tougher jam . 	 The Yankees put a runner on in every inning against Saunders but failed to score until the sixth . 	 Derek Jeter lined an outside pitch to right field for a leadoff double in sixth , showing no ill effects of a bruised left foot that kept him from playing shortstop in the postseason for the first time in his career . 	 He advanced on Ichiro Suzuki 's sacrifice and scored on Robinson Cano 's grounder to second . Showalter then lifted Saunders for right - hander Tommy Hunter to face Rodriguez . A - Rod struck out to loud boos and tossed his bat . 	 NOTES : Highlights of Ibanez 's two homers in Game 3 received loud cheers each time the clips were showed on the video board . ...   Curtis Granderson has struck out nine times in 16 at - bats this postseason . ... Hughes and Saunders combined to walk seven after there were no walks Wednesday in 12 innings . ... Jeter got his 199th postseason hit . 	 Detroit got a jump - start on the winter signings , landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez . We break down the deal . 	 In a free - agent field filled with future Hall of Famers , Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter . 	 Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox . 	 Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr. 's career .

OAKLAND , Calif. --   Once he finally made his way to the victorious visiting clubhouse , Justin Verlander 's teammates greeted him with chants of " Cy Young ! " and sprayed him in the face with bubbly . 	 Already among baseball 's best starters , Verlander showed he sure can finish . 	 Detroit 's ace and MVP bookended the AL division series with 11 - strikeout gems , throwing a four - hitter in the decisive fifth game to get the Tigers back to the AL championship series for a second straight year with a 6 - 0 victory over the Oakland Athletics on Thursday night . 	 " I thought he might have thrown 300 pitches if he had to , " slugger Prince Fielder said . " He was n't coming out of the game . No way . " 	 Verlander delivered a day after closer Jose Valverde failed to hold a ninth - inning lead as Detroit was pushed to the brink after jumping out to a 2 - 0 series lead back home at Comerica Park . 	 Verlander tossed his first career postseason shutout and complete game with a 122 - pitch masterpiece . 	 " He had a look in his eye today , " manager Jim Leyland said . " A complete - game look in his eye . " 	 The Tigers will face either the New York Yankees or Baltimore Orioles , tied at two games apiece heading into Game 5 on Friday night in New York . Game 1 of the ALCS is scheduled for Saturday . 	 Verlander , the reigning AL Cy Young Award winner and MVP , was so sharp nobody in the bullpen ever got up to throw . He struck out 22 in his wins on both ends of this nail - biting series . 	 After squandering two chances to clinch the series , including blowing a two - run ninth - inning lead in Game 4 , Leyland left it all up to Verlander just as he said he would . 	 " I think it 's one of those things , I expected to go nine innings , " Verlander said . " In this situation , in a Game 5 , I wanted to go all the way . " 	 Austin Jackson hit an RBI double in the third and a run - scoring single as the Tigers added on with a four - run seventh . Fielder had an RBI single . 	 The Tigers are on to another ALCS despite getting just one RBI all series from Triple Crown winner Miguel Cabrera -- on a bases - loaded hit by pitch , no less . Booed by the yellow - towel - waving sellout crowd of 36,393 each time he stepped into the batter 's box . Cabrera finished 5 - for-20 , and it was his blooper dropped by Coco Crisp in a 5 - 4 Game 2 victory Sunday that allowed two runs to score . 	 Leyland all but called Verlander 's latest gem . 	 " Justin Verlander 's a pretty tough chore for anybody , " Leyland said . 	 The Detroit skipper gave the ball to his 17 - game winner and said beforehand the Tigers would likely win or lose with the hard - throwing right - hander on the mound . 	 And , against the A 's -- or anybody else , for that matter -- Verlander usually wins . 	 " This is where legends are made , " catcher Alex Avila said . " Tonight , he basically put us on his back and said , ` We 're not going to lose . " 	 Verlander recorded the most strikeouts in a shutout of a winner - take - all postseason game , topping Sandy Koufax 's 10 in the 1965 World Series against Minnesota . 	 " When you 're going into pressure situations like this , there 's nobody better to have on the mound than Justin , " Jackson said . 	 Verlander followed up an 11 - strikeout outing in Detroit 's 3 - 1 Game 1 win Saturday with another overpowering performance in his 10th postseason start . He improved to 3 - 0 with a 2.11 ERA in three postseason starts against the A 's and upped his career mark to 5 - 4 with 2.15 ERA in 10 starts at the Coliseum . 	 Verlander had allowed one earned run with a 0.69 ERA in beating the A 's twice during the regular season . 	 " He 's always tough . You go out there and you battle him the best that you can , " Crisp said . " Today he had some of his best stuff of the year . " 	 Detroit finally got to party in a visiting clubhouse that for the sixth straight game was prepped for a possible clinch celebration . 	 The Texas Rangers were in town last week needing one victory to win the AL West but dropped all three to lose the division to the surprising A 's in Game No . 162 . 	 On Wednesday night , plastic covering the floor and lockers was torn down in all of about 40 seconds after Valverde allowed three runs in the bottom of the ninth as Oakland won with another walkoff in a season full of them . 	 This time , the Tigers let loose . 	 Verlander hollered " Whoo ! " when he entered the clubhouse and quickly ran to a table to grab a celebratory bottle before being doused from all directions . 	 " It was awesome and horrible at the same time because you ca n't see a thing , " he said . " Your eyes are burning and all I want to do is look up and celebrate with my teammates . And all I can do is look down and shut my eyes . " 	 After Seth Smith grounded out to end the game , the A 's stayed on the field to greet the fans who were still on their feet chanting , " Let 's go , Oakland ! " Verlander waved toward the Oakland players in a classy acknowledgment . 	 Detroit 's offense did more than enough to give Verlander a cushion on another relatively quiet night by Cabrera and Fielder , the team 's $ 214 million cleanup hitter . 	 Cabrera went five straight games without an RBI on four different occasions during the regular season but did n't extend that to the playoffs when Ryan Cook plunked him with the bases loaded in the seventh . 	 Oakland 's miscues on the mound only helped matters . 	 Omar Infante singled to start the third inning against A 's starter Jarrod Parker , then moved to second on a wild pitch . Then , with Cabrera batting after Jackson 's double and a sacrifice by Quintin Berry that moved him up a base , Parker threw another wild pitch that allowed Jackson to score . 	 The upstart A 's were attempting to become the ninth team to rally from a 2 - 0 deficit in a best - of - five series but could n't match the cross - bay Giants after San Francisco won at Cincinnati earlier in the day to reach the NLCS . 	 So much for all that chatter about another Bay Bridge World Series in Northern California like the earthquake - interrupted Series in 1989 swept by the A 's . 	 Oakland struck out 50 times in a series of swings and misses riding high only a week ago after stunning the two - time reigning AL champion Rangers on the regular season 's final day to win the AL West . The K 's were the most in A 's franchise history for a five - game series . 	 The A 's payroll of $ 59.5 million is lowest in the majors . But the last game was the only lopsided one . 	 Detroit eliminated Oakland again after the Tigers pulled off a four - game sweep in the 2006 AL championship series . 	 " We did n't think it was going to end today , not for a second , " A 's manager Bob Melvin said . " We knew we were going up against a good pitcher . That did n't mean we did n't think we were going to win .   We 've gone up against good pitchers this year . And it 's a bit of a shock when it finally does end . It was a heck of a story . It was a heck of a run for us . " 	 The Tigers now look to get through another round after falling in six games to the Rangers in last year 's ALCS . 	 NOTES : Josh Reddick , who hit a team - leading 32 homers , struck out 10 times for the most by an A 's player in a postseason series . The only person with more K 's than Reddick in a division series was Seattle 's Bret Boone with 11 in 2001 . ... The A 's have lost eight of their past nine postseason series . ... Cabrera has reached base safely in all 16 of his postseason games with the Tigers .   ... Verlander is Detroit 's all - time postseason leader in strikeouts ( 70 ) and wins ( 5 ) . 	 Detroit got a jump - start on the winter signings , landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez . We break down the deal . 	 In a free - agent field filled with future Hall of Famers , Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter . 	 Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox . 	 Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr. 's career . 	 Former Boston Red Sox left - hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five - year deal worth $ 77 million , sources confirmed to ESPN . 	 From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right , this is your one - stop shop as baseball 's 2021 hardware is handed out .

NEW YORK --   CC Sabathia turned and looked over his right shoulder , watching intently after Nate McLouth turned on a 93 mph fastball and sent it soaring down the right - field line . 	 Yankees - Orioles . Playoffs . Disputed home run . 	 Again . 	 McLouth 's long drive was called foul by the slimmest of margins -- hello , Jeffrey Maier -- and New York hung on to beat Baltimore 3 - 1 on Friday in the deciding Game 5 of the AL Division Series . 	 Sixteen years later , the Orioles still ca n't find the right stuff in the Bronx . 	 With Alex Rodriguez benched , the Yankees advanced to the AL Championship Series against the Detroit Tigers , starting Saturday night in the Bronx . 	 " It is still a long way to go , " Sabathia said . " I still got hopefully three or four more starts . So the job is not done yet . " 	 Sabathia pitched a four - hitter , wriggling out of a bases - loaded jam in the eighth inning for his first complete game in 17 postseason starts , and the first for the Yankees since Roger Clemens in 2000 . 	 Yet it was another piece of history that this game evoked . 	 The Orioles were in a foul mood , stung on a close play in right that echoed what happened across the street at the old Yankee Stadium in the 1996 AL championship opener , on a fly ball involving the young Maier that still stirs emotions in Baltimore . 	 This time , with the Orioles trailing 1 - 0 in the sixth , McLouth sent a 3 - 1 pitch deep . Eyes turned to right field umpire Fieldin Culbreth , who demonstrably waved foul with both arms . 	 Orioles manager Buck Showalter jogged onto the field to ask for a video review , and four umpires went down a tunnel on the third - base side to examine the images on a screen near their dressing room . When they ran back onto the field about two minutes later , they did n't make any signal -- meaning the original call stood . McLouth struck out on the next pitch , ending the inning . 	 " I saw it go to the right of the pole , " Culbreth said . " There is netting there and it did n't touch the netting . " 	 " It did not change direction , " he added , indicating he did not think the ball grazed the pole . 	 Added crew chief Brian Gorman : " We saw the same thing on the replay . There was no evidence to overturn the decision . " 	 Showalter ? Not sure . 	 " I could n't tell . It was real close , " he said . 	 McLouth wondered , too , what the umps would decide . 	 " It started off fair and it was just hooking a little bit . I thought it was foul just in game speed , " McLouth said . " A couple of people mentioned it might 've ticked the pole , but he was way closer than I was and I was satisfied after they went down and looked at the replay that it was foul . " 	 That 's the way Yankees right fielder Nick Swisher saw it . 	 " I did n't see any redirection , " he said . " If it had hit , I would have been the first to know . " 	 Steven Ellis , a fan from the Broad Channel section of Queens , caught the ball with his Yankee cap in the second deck . 	 " It was foul all the way , never hit the pole , " he said . 	 Ada Cruz , sitting behind Ellis , added : " No way , no way . I watched it and he caught it . " 	 A stadium usher who would n't give his name , however , said he saw the ball glance off the pole . 	 Back in 1996 , the 12 - year - old Maier reached over the wall above right fielder Tony Tarasco and deflected Derek Jeter 's fly ball . Umpire Richie Garcia called it a home run , which tied the score at 4 - all in the eighth inning , and the Yankees went on to win in the 11th . 	 " Just watching at home , I promise , " Maier texted to The Associated Press after this play . 	 Sabathia defeated the Orioles for the second time in six days , Raul Ibanez hit a go - ahead single in the fifth off Jason Hammel after former Baltimore high school star Mark Teixeira singled and swiped second in a rare steal . Diving second baseman Robert Andino just missed gloving Ibanez 's hit . 	 Ichiro Suzuki added an RBI double off the right - center field wall in the sixth . Curtis Granderson boosted the lead to 3 - 0 with a second - deck solo homer against Troy Patton in the seventh . 	 Sabathia , who improved to 4 - 0 in his last eight postseason starts , did n't allow an extra - base hit . He struck out eight , walked two and matched his season high of 121 pitches . 	 " He did n't pitch all five , but it certainly felt like it , did n't it ? " Showalter said . 	 Since going winless in four straight starts in late August and early September , Sabathia is 4 - 0 with a 1.51 ERA in five outings . 	 " He 's our go - to guy , " Jeter said . " He 's been our go - to guy since he 's been here . " 	 Sabathia took a one - hit shutout into the eighth but allowed Matt Wieters ' leadoff single and Manny Machado 's walk . Mark Reynolds struck out , and Lew Ford -- starting at DH in place of Jim Thome -- hit an RBI single . 	 Andino hit a bouncer to the third - base side that Sabathia gloved , but Eric Chavez left third uncovered and Sabathia 's throw to second was late , leaving the bases loaded . With David Robertson warming up in the New York bullpen , McLouth struck out on a changeup and Sabathia escaped when J.J. Hardy hit a slow three - hopper to shortstop that Jeter , playing on a sore left ankle , charged and gloved elegantly before throwing to first just in time . 	 Sabathia pitched a 1 - 2 - 3 ninth , finishing a 121 - pitch effort as Wieters hit a comebacker . The Yankees ran out of their dugout to celebrate on the third - base side of the mound , and the Orioles walked off slowly and somberly . 	 New York does n't have much time to get ready for the Tigers . Andy Pettitte , the career postseason leader with 19 wins , starts for the Yankees with a rested bullpen behind him , opposed by Doug Fister . 	 " I came back to hopefully help this club get into this position , " Pettitte said . 	 For Baltimore , which beat Texas in the first AL wild - card playoff , it was a disappointing ending to a renaissance season for the proud franchise . The Orioles went 93 - 69 , finishing behind the Yankees in an AL East race decided on the final night , and ended a streak of 14 consecutive losing seasons . 	 " It 's been about as much fun as I have had in the big leagues watching how they play the game every day , the standard they held themselves to and the way they raised the bar in Baltimore with each other , " said Showalter , who has not reached the LCS in 14 major league seasons . 	 New York won for the 12th time in 23 meetings between the teams in a matchup so close the Yankees outscored the Orioles 106 - 102 . The teams were within one run of each other at the end of 46 of 52 innings in the division series . New York totaled just 16 runs in the five games and Baltimore 10 , ending a dynamic six - week struggle . After 10 different nights in September , the two rivals were tied for first . 	 " They are a very good club and they are a very resilient club , " Yankees manager Joe Girardi said . " You have a bunch of young kids over there that just play the game the right way and play hard . And you think about it , we played 23 games , and there were four runs that separated us . It 's an accomplishment for both clubs because they never went away . People thought they were going to go away , they never went away . " 	 Rodriguez ( 2 for 16 ) , Robinson Cano ( 2 for 22 ) , Swisher ( 2 for 18 ) and Granderson ( 3 for 19 ) all slumped against Baltimore . The Yankees advanced despite hitting .219 with runners in scoring position ( 7 for 32 ) -- but Baltimore was 3 for 22 in that situation during the three games in New York . 	 Slumping Orioles hitters included Wieters ( 3 for 20 ) , Hardy ( 3 for 22 ) and Jones ( 2 for 23 ) . 	 " It 's just unfortunate a lot of guys got cold at the wrong time , " Adam Jones said . 	 With a 5:07 p.m. ET start on the first chilly night of autumn , there was an unusual sight at Yankee Stadium at the start -- large patches of empty seats . And Baltimore fans could be heard chanting " O " during " The Star - Spangled Banner . " But the ballpark filled up by the middle innings . 	 The 37 - year - old Rodriguez , hitless in 12 at - bats against right - handed pitchers with nine strikeouts , was a spectator , too , in a decision that could have long - term repercussions for the Yankees , who owe him $ 114 million over the next five seasons . He did not speak with reporters after the game . 	 Chavez , who replaced A - Rod at third base , went 0 for 3 with a pair of strikeouts . 	 In the Yankees clubhouse , where anything less than a World Series is failure , the celebration was muted . Three postseason wins down , eight to go . 	 " We 'll enjoy this one for a few minutes , " Jeter said , " and then get ready for tomorrow " 	 Game notes 	  The crowd of 47,081 was the smallest in 18 postseason games at new Yankee Stadium , which opened in 2009 . ... New York is 11 - 3 in the ALCS . ... The 26 runs were the fewest in a five - game postseason series since St. Louis ( 12 ) and Arizona ( 10 ) combined for 22 runs in the 2001 NLDS . 	 Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year . 	 From MVP to Cy Young and more , this is your one - stop shop as baseball 's 2021 hardware is handed out . 	 Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season , leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR . 	 Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India 's 2021 campaign . 	 Julio Lugo , who played for seven teams in a 12 - year major league career , has died . He was 45 . 	 Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers .

WASHINGTON --   Does n't matter how bad things look for the St. Louis Cardinals . Trailing by a bunch , down to their last strike , they simply stay calm and do what it takes to win . 	 Erasing an early six - run hole in Game 5 slowly but surely , the defending World Series champion Cardinals got a tying two - out , two - run single from Daniel Descalso and a go - ahead two - run single from Pete Kozma in the ninth inning and came all the way back to beat the Washington Nationals 9 - 7 Friday night and win their NL division series . 	 It was the largest comeback ever in a winner - take - all postseason game , according to STATS LLC . No other club in this sort of ultimate - pressure situation had come back from more than four down . 	 " We knew we had a lot of game left after they scored six . Nobody went up there trying to hit a six - run homer , " said Descalso , whose solo shot in the eighth made it 6 - 5 . " We needed to scratch and claw and get ourselves back in the game . " 	 They did , barely : Descalso 's saving single ticked off the glove of diving shortstop Ian Desmond . 	 First - year manager Mike Matheny and the wild - card Cardinals , the last team to clinch a playoff spot this year , will open the NL Championship Series at San Francisco on Sunday . 	 The Nationals , meanwhile , led the majors with 98 wins in 2012 but lost without All - Star ace Stephen Strasburg . The team said he 'd thrown enough this year and did n't put him on the playoff roster . 	 Down 7 - 5 with two outs in the ninth against Nationals closer Drew Storen , the Cardinals twice were a strike away from losing . But Storen walked both of those batters , Yadier Molina and David Freese , setting the stage for the unheralded Descalso and Kozma -- Nationals manager Davey Johnson even called the rookie " Cosmos " before Game 4 -- to come through . 	 When Cardinals closer Jason Motte got Ryan Zimmerman to pop out to second base a half - hour past midnight , the Cardinals streamed from the visiting dugout for a rather muted celebration , all in all . 	 This was nothing new to them . 	 Over the past two years , St. Louis is 6 - 0 when facing elimination , including victories in Games 6 and 7 of the 2011 World Series against Texas . 	 " It 's just the kind of people they are . They believe in themselves . They believe in each other , " Matheny said . " It 's been this style of team all season long . They just do n't quit , and I think that just says a lot about their character . " 	 Down to their last strike in the Fall Classic a year ago , trailing by the exact same 7 - 5 score in the ninth inning , the Cardinals rallied in Game 6 and then took the championship in what turned out to be the final year with the club for slugging first baseman Albert Pujols and then - manager Tony La Russa . Now Matheny , who got the Cardinals into the playoffs as the second NL wild - card team on the next - to - last day of the regular season , has them back in the NLCS . 	 And to think : Washington , which won the NL East and led the majors with 98 wins , got off to as good a start as possible Friday . 	 Seven pitches , three runs . Just like that , Jayson Werth 's double , Bryce Harper 's triple and Zimmerman 's homer got the hosts jump - started in their first Game 5 . 	 That opening outburst , plus a big third inning highlighted by the 19 - year - old Harper 's homer , made it 6 - 0 . 	 St. Louis was not about to go gently into the night , though . 	 " Would have been easy for us to go down 6 - 0 and sort of roll over and let the crowd take us out of it , " Descalso said , " and just let them have the game . " 	 The Cardinals chipped away , chipped away . One run off 21 - game winner Gio Gonzalez in the fourth , a pair in the fifth , another in the seventh off Edwin Jackson -- the Game 3 starter and loser , and an all - around surprising choice for midgame relief . 	 Suddenly , it was 6 - 4 . Then came Descalso 's homer in the eighth . After Kurt Suzuki drove in a run for Washington to get the lead back up to 7 - 5 , a four - run ninth against Storen -- who had elbow surgery in April , returned to the team in July and reclaimed his closer role in September -- completed the reversal . 	 " We 've had a great year overcoming a lot of hardship , " Nationals manager Davey Johnson said , " and to not go after them at the end was not fun to watch . " 	 Carlos Beltran began the ninth with a double . Two quick outs later , though , Washington was oh - so - close to a victory . But Storen could n't get the last strike on Molina . Same thing with Freese . Then Descalso 's shot up the middle went off Desmond 's glove . The Nationals were inches , perhaps , from advancing . The Cardinals that near to their season finished . 	 Instead , they carry on , like they always seem to at this time of year . St. Louis is in the NLCS for the seventh time since the start of the 2000 season . 	 In Game 6 of last year 's World Series , the Cardinals twice were one strike from losing , before Freese 's two - run triple in the ninth , then Lance Berkman 's tying RBI single in the 10th . Freese 's homer won it in the 11th , and St. Louis went on to a 6 - 2 victory in Game 7 . 	 Here they were , doing it again . 	 All in front of a Nationals Park - record crowd of 45,966 witnessing the first postseason series in the nation 's capital in 79 years . So seemingly close to a significant triumph , the Nationals -- and their fans -- left disappointed . Not long after the final out , a few dozen Cardinals fans gathered in the rows right behind the visiting dugout to chant , " Let 's go , Cards ! Let 's go , Cards ! " 	 Hours earlier , the red - dressed D.C. spectators began the night with chants of " Let 's go , Nats ! " right after the national anthem , then filled the raw October air with roars as run after run scored for the home team . But over the final innings , those Washington baseball fans wound up looking on with hearts in throats . 	 At the outset , highlights of leadoff hitter Werth 's epic , 13 - pitch at - bat from about 25½ hours before were shown on the video board as he began the bottom of the first . On Thursday night , he ended Game 4 with a homer in the bottom of the ninth that gave Washington a 2 - 1 victory . 	 Picking up right where he left off , Werth doubled to the left - field corner off Adam Wainwright , and Harper followed with an RBI triple off the wall in left - center . Harper wo n't turn 20 until Tuesday ; no other teen had a postseason three - bagger , according to STATS . 	 Harper was 1 - for-18 for a .056 batting average -- yes , .056 -- with six strikeouts and zero RBIs in the NLDS until that moment . After sliding in well ahead of the throw to third , he popped up and pointed at Werth , who kept clapping and clapping after crossing home plate . 	 A foot or two higher , and that hit by Harper would have been a homer . No matter : Zimmerman completed the crescendo by driving an 86 mph cutter into the first row beyond the wall in right - center . 	 In 11 previous postseason appearances -- mainly as a reliever -- Wainwright never had allowed more than one run in any entire outing , much less three in a single inning . 	 Got worse in the third . Harper led off with a homer , to the same area of right - center as Zimmerman 's but a few rows deeper . Zimmerman doubled , and Michael Morse turned on the next pitch for a two - run homer to left that made it 6 - 0 . 	 That was it for Wainwright , whose evening was over after 53 pitches across 2 1/3 innings . 	 His season , however , will continue . He plays for the can't - quit Cardinals , after all . 	 Game notes 	  Beltran went 3 - for-3 plus two walks . ... The 9 - 7 final score might be familiar to longtime Washington baseball historians .

From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right , this is your one - stop shop as baseball 's 2021 hardware is handed out . 	 Even Shohei Ohtani , arguably the best player in the major leagues , feels down at times , particularly when his team is n't winning .

NEW YORK --   The New York Yankees lost the AL Championship Series opener and their captain when Derek Jeter broke his left ankle moments after Detroit 's Delmon Young doubled home the go - ahead run in the 12th inning , giving the Tigers a bizarre 6 - 4 win on Saturday night . 	 In a game of wild swings and wild swings of emotion , the Tigers took a 4 - 0 lead into the ninth before Raul Ibanez struck again , hitting a tying , two - run homer with two outs that turned a somber crowd into a delirious one . 	 And then came a little grounder up the middle that devastated the Yankees and their fans , who saw their leader writhing on the ground , screaming in pain . 	 Jeter rolled when he reached down in an attempt to glove Jhonny Peralta 's grounder up the middle in the 12th , planted his left foot and tumbled , landing on his stomach . Unable to move , he backflipped the ball toward second baseman Robinson Cano . 	 Jeter was down for about a minute and was helped up , then assisted to the dugout with manager Joe Girardi on his left and trainer Steve Donahue on his right . 	 " They talked about a three - month recovery period , " Girardi said . " Wo n't jeopardize his career , but he will not be playing any more for us this year . " 	 Jeter , who extended his career record earlier in the game with his 200th postseason hit , has been playing with a sore left foot for weeks . He joined closer Mariano Rivera on the sidelines . Rivera tore a knee ligament in May while shagging fly balls before a game in Kansas City . 	 " It is kind of a flashback to when Mo did n't get up , " Girardi said . " Oh , boy , if he is not getting up , something 's wrong . We have seen what he played through in the last month and a half , and the pain he has been in , and how he found a way to get ( through ) it . So it brought back a flashback for me . " 	 Still , without Rivera , the Yankees won the AL East for the 13th time in 17 years . 	 " I think some people left us for dead when Mo went down , and here we are in the ALCS . " Girardi said . " And Jeet is going to tell us , ` Let 's go . " 	 Eduardo Nunez will fill Jeter 's roster spot , with Jayson Nix likely taking over at shortstop . 	 " We 've got to win this series . Somebody 's got to step in and fill that spot , " starting pitcher Andy Pettitte said . 	 Detroit was coasting toward a 4 - 0 win before the Yankees rocked Tigers closer Jose Valverde in the ninth . Valverde has allowed seven runs in three playoff games and could lose his closer 's role to Octavio Dotel . 	 " We really want to put our heads together and discuss it first , to be honest with you , and get together as a coaching staff and talk about it , " Tigers manager Jim Leyland said . 	 Ichiro Suzuki started the comeback with a two - run homer with one out , and the 40 - year - old Ibanez hit another two - run drive with two outs . Three nights earlier , Ibanez hit a tying home run in the ninth against Baltimore in Game 3 of the ALDS and another homer in the 12th to win it . 	 " If we are going to be good enough , we have to be able to take a punch , and we took a big punch , " Leyland said . " We took a right cross in the ninth inning but we survived it . " 	 Young 's one - out double off David Phelps , which followed a leadoff walk by Triple Crown winner Miguel Cabrera , sliced in right and eluded Nick Swisher , who appeared ready to dive but could n't get his glove out when he realized the ball was closer to him than he had thought . 	 " I thought I had a great jump , but then I got caught in the lights , and I lost it for a few seconds , " Swisher said . " I was completely blind . It 's a helpless feeling . I really thought I could make that play . " 	 Young drove in three runs , hitting an RBI single in a two - run sixth against Pettitte , and a solo homer in the eighth against Derek Lowe . That gave him a Tigers record six postseason homers , breaking a tie with Hank Greenberg and Craig Monroe . 	 " We 're big leaguers . Things are going to happen , " Young said . " The other team wants to drive Mercedes - Benz 's and eat Morton 's , too . ... We got back in to play the 10th inning . Everyone just regrouped , and basically a 0 - 0 ballgame . " 	 Tigers rookie Avisail Garcia singled in a run against Boone Logan , and Andy Dirks added an RBI single in the 12th on a comebacker that glanced off Phelps ' pitching hand . 	 Rookie Drew Smyly , who had started warming up in the third when starter Doug Fister took a line drive off his right wrist , got the win by pitching two scoreless innings . 	 In Game 2 on Sunday , New York will start Hiroki Kuroda , who will be pitching on three days ' rest for the first time in his big league career . Detroit will send Anibal Sanchez to the mound . 	 Twenty - five of 42 previous Game 1 winners have gone on to take the AL pennant . 	 Before the 12th , the star of the night was Ibanez , the first player to hit three home runs in the ninth inning or later in a single postseason . 	 On Wednesday , he hit a tying shot as a pinch hitter , and three innings later became the first player to hit two homers in a postseason game he did n't start . 	 This made him the first player in baseball history with two tying ninth - inning home runs in a single postseason , according to STATS LLC . Johnny Bench , in 1972 and 1976 , had been the only player to do it twice in a career . 	 Fister escaped three bases - loaded jams in the first six innings -- the first time in their 375 postseason games the Yankees stranded a trio of runners three times without scoring in any of those innings , according to STATS LLC . 	 Alex Rodriguez , back in New York 's lineup following a benching in Friday 's division series finale , was 0 for 3 and stranded six runners -- striking out on three pitches with runners at second and third and no outs in the sixth as fans booed loudly . 	 Girardi sent up Eric Chavez to hit for A - Rod in the eighth , the third time Rodriguez was taken out early in the last three games he has played . 	 Not that A - Rod 's teammates were any better . New York left the bases loaded in three innings without scoring in them for the first time ever in 375 postseason games , according to STATS LLC . The Yankees stranded 13 runners and were 3 for 13 with runners in scoring position , leaving them at 10 for 45 ( 7 for 32 ) ( .222 ) in the playoffs . 	 Fister , who beat the Yankees in Game 5 of last year 's division series , had a shaky start , walking the bases loaded in the first and allowing three two - out singles in the second . 	 Rodriguez bounced into a forceout that ended the first , with shortstop Peralta making a spectacular diving stop . In the second , Cano lined a ball off the inside of Fister 's right wrist , and Peralta picked it up on a bounce and threw to first for the out . Both plays were so close that even replays did n't definitively show whether the calls were correct . 	 Detroit was so concerned about Fister 's wrist that Smyly started warming up in the third . Fister changed from a short sleeve undershirt into long sleeves and stayed in the game for 6 1/3 scoreless innings . His finest moment came with Detroit leading 2 - 0 in the sixth . After fanning Rodriguez , he loaded the bases with a walk to Swisher , then struck out Curtis Granderson and Martin with breaking balls . 	 Fister allowed six hits , struck out five and walked four . 	 " It was a little stiff , little sore , but nothing too major , " Fister said . " I went in and checked it out , and made sure nothing was remarkably hurt . Put on some sleeves to keep warm , and went back out there . " 	 Rodriguez was dropped to sixth in the batting order for the first time since the 2006 playoff finale against Detroit , but the key situations find the $ 275 million man no matter where he is . He is hitting .105 ( 2 for 19 ) with no RBIs in the postseason , going hitless in 15 at - bats against right - handed pitchers with 10 strikeouts . A - Rod has n't homered in 87 at - bats since Sept. 14 . 	 Cano ( 2 for 28 ) , Granderson ( 3 for 23 ) and Swisher ( 3 for 23 ) also remained mired in deep postseason slumps , with Swisher 's eighth - inning double the only hit among the three . 	 Making his record 44th postseason start , Pettitte gave up two runs and seven hits in 6 2/3 innings . 	 Game notes 	  Leyland is 2 - 4 in previous LCS he has managed . ... On a cool , 49 - degree night , there were empty seats in the top two decks in the outfield for the second straight day .

NEW YORK --   The Detroit Tigers got a big boost from Anibal Sanchez 's arm . They got a helping hand from an umpire , too . 	 The reward : a commanding 2 - 0 lead in the American League Championship Series , and a trip home with their ace ready to start . 	 Sanchez shut down a Yankees lineup minus injured Derek Jeter , Detroit scored twice after an admitted missed call by an ump and won without any extra - inning drama , beating New York 3 - 0 on Sunday . 	 " He was terrific , " Detroit manager Jim Leyland said . " This is a tough place to pitch with a tough lineup and a short porch . And a whole bunch of left - handed hitters , it is not easy . That was quite a feat . " 	 New York starter Hiroki Kuroda pitched perfect ball into the sixth inning to keep pace with Sanchez . But Robinson Cano and the slumping Yankees hitters were no match for the 28 - year - old right - hander a day after its captain broke his ankle in the 12th inning of a 6 - 4 loss . 	 " I try to think backwards , " Sanchez said . " If the count calls for a fastball , I throw a different pitch . If the count calls for a different pitch , I throw a fastball . I try to mix my speeds . " 	 To get out of a jam in the first inning , he thought backward , all right : try reaching around his back to snare a grounder for the final out . 	 Making his second postseason start , Sanchez threw three - hit ball deep into the game to make Leyland 's job easier . Closer Jose Valverde gave up four runs in the ninth Saturday and , only hours later , Leyland said the righty would n't close Game 2 . 	 Delmon Young gave Sanchez his first run of support in these playoffs with a fielder 's choice in the seventh . The Tigers then scored twice in the eighth after second base umpire Jeff Nelson missed a call on a two - out tag at second base . Yankees manager Joe Girardi argued , and was ejected on his 48th birthday . 	 " The hand did not get in before the tag , " Nelson said after seeing a replay . " The call was incorrect . " 	 Game 3 in the best - of - seven series is Tuesday night in Detroit , with reigning AL MVP Justin Verlander starting for the Tigers against Phil Hughes . Verlander went 2 - 0 in the division series versus Oakland , including a four - hit shutout with 11 strikeouts in the decisive Game 5 . 	 The Tigers led 1 - 0 in the eighth and had Omar Infante on first with two outs . Austin Jackson singled and when Infante took a wide turn at second , right fielder Nick Swisher threw behind him . 	 Cano made a swipe tag as Infante made a head - first dive back to second . Cano missed Infante 's arm but brushed his body , replays clearly showed . But Nelson called Infante safe . 	 " I think the umpire got confused 'cause he saw my hand , something with my hand made him think I was safe , " Infante said . 	 Was he out ? 	 " Of course , " Infante said . 	 Cano and Girardi pleaded the call to no avail . Boone Logan replaced Kuroda and gave up an RBI single to pinch hitter Avisail Garcia to make it 2 - 0 . 	 " It 's frustrating . I do n't have a problem with Jeff 's effort , I do n't , because he hustled to get to the play . But in this day and age when we have instant replay available to us , it 's got to change , " Girardi said . 	 " These guys are under tremendous amounts of pressure . It is a tough call for him because the tag is underneath and it 's hard for him to see . And it takes more time to argue and get upset than you get the call right . Too much is at stake , " he said . 	 Girardi returned to lift Logan for Joba Chamberlain , and then he remained on the field to resume the argument . Red - faced with neck muscles bulging , Girardi could be seen shouting at Nelson , " You were right there . How could you miss it ? " He was tossed by Nelson for his first postseason ejection . 	 Miguel Cabrera added a run - scoring single after the ejection . 	 Cano had no luck at the plate , either . The All - Star 's slump extended to a record 26 hitless at - bats in a single postseason , breaking the mark of 24 set by Baltimore 's Bobby Bonilla in 1996 , STATS LLC said . 	 " I feel good at the plate , " Cano said . " So , all I can do is stay positive and play good Tuesday . " 	 There were many empty seats near the foul poles , and a subdued crowd spent much of the day venting its frustration , booing the punchless Yankees . The 47,082 in attendance reserved its biggest cheers early for Jeter , who broke his ankle in the last inning of the Game 1 loss . 	 " I do n't know what 's going on here , it seems like something is going on here , " Tigers reliever Octavio Dotel said . " I mean , I do n't want to wake them , I do n't want them to get loud . I do n't know what 's going on but I like it . " 	 The " Bleacher Creatures " included the captain in their roll call and fans let out a modest cheer pregame when Jeter was shown in video thanking fans on the scoreboard . 	 While the Yankees are headed to Detroit for what they hope will be three games , their captain will fly to Charlotte , N.C. , to visit a foot specialist . 	 Jhonny Peralta singled in the sixth for the Tigers ' first baserunner against Kuroda , who was pitching on short rest for the first time in his big league career . Young then gave Detroit the lead with a forceout grounder in the seventh , a night after putting the Tigers ahead in the 12th inning with a double . 	 Sanchez has had quite the success in the Bronx . He made his big league debut at the old Yankee Stadium when it was across the street , and pitched 5 2/3 shutout innings for Marlins in 2006 . The only player to notch two hits against him in that game was Jeter . 	 Pitching for the first time in this 4 - year - old ballpark -- and in front of his parents -- Sanchez limited the slumping Yankees to just three hits and three walks , one an intentional pass to Raul Ibanez . 	 When Ichiro Suzuki reached on Sanchez 's fielding error to open the sixth and advanced to third with two outs , Peralta was there to bail out his pitcher with another nifty play , bare - handing a slow grounder for the third out . 	 Leyland took Valverde out of consideration for the closer role on Sunday . Valverde gave up a pair of two - run homers in the ninth inning Saturday night and also blew a save in the division series . 	 Former Yankees reliever Phil Coke pitched two innings for the save . 	 " Jose Valverde will be an important part of this club in this playoff or we are going to have a real tough time , " Leyland said . " I just hope that the people back home are , like I said , not too short - minded because this guy has been fantastic , and is an important piece in the scenario , in my opinion . " 	 Kuroda did all he could to help keep it close for the Yankees ' anemic offense . 	 Curtis Granderson went 0 for 3 with three strikeouts and a walk and Alex Rodriguez singled in the ninth for his third hit of the postseason and finished 1 for 4 . A - Rod is 0 for 18 with 12 Ks against right - handed pitchers in these playoffs . When he lined out to left field in the seventh fans gave a mock cheer . 	 " We 've been through stretches like this all year , " Rodriguez said . " It 's been a very volatile stock market for us this year . " 	 Game notes 	  Cabrera reached base in all 18 playoff games with Detroit , matching Hank Greenberg for the longest streak in team history . 	 Detroit got a jump - start on the winter signings , landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez . We break down the deal . 	 In a free - agent field filled with future Hall of Famers , Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter . 	 Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox . 	 Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr. 's career . 	 Former Boston Red Sox left - hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five - year deal worth $ 77 million , sources confirmed to ESPN . 	 From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right , this is your one - stop shop as baseball 's 2021 hardware is handed out .

SAN FRANCISCO --   Ahead by a lot or behind by a bunch , these St. Louis Cardinals are winning every which way . 	 Boosted by two - run homers from proven postseason stars Carlos Beltran and David Freese , and 5 1/3 innings from a steady bullpen , these wild , wild - card Cardinals beat the San Francisco Giants 6 - 4 on Sunday night in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series . 	 The defending World Series champions built an early 6 - 0 cushion and held on . Only two nights earlier , the Cardinals came back from the same deficit , using a four - run rally in the ninth inning at Washington in the deciding Game 5 of the division series . 	 " I 'm thinking about the D.C. game , " Freese said . " They were up 6 - 0 . We were up 6 - 0 . And that shows that you 've got to keep playing . ... We were fortunate enough that our bullpen came in and closed the door the rest of the way . " 	 Starter Lance Lynn was done after 3 2/3 innings . Edward Mujica , the fifth St. Louis pitcher , struck out the side in order in the seventh for the win . Jason Motte finished for his second save of the postseason . 	 The Cardinals gave first - year manager Mike Matheny a win against his former club . 	 Matheny 's crew hardly looked road weary after a cross - country trip . The Giants dropped to 0 - 3 at home so far during these playoffs , outscored 20 - 6 at AT&T Park . 	 Game 2 in the best - of - seven series is Monday night . Chris Carpenter pitches for the Cardinals against Ryan Vogelsong . 	 This is the first time the previous two World Series winners are facing off in the postseason since the 1958 World Series between the Braves and Yankees . 	 " The way we play the game , we have been in this type of situation before in the regular season , " Beltran said . " These guys have this mentality of not panicking . " 	 Beltran 's fourth - inning drive into the seats in left - center chased San Francisco starter Madison Bumgarner , who has been a far cry from the impressive pitcher he was during the 2010 World Series run . 	 It was Beltran 's 14th career postseason home run and third this October . 	 " Right now I 'm really enjoying myself , " Beltran said . " Right now I 'm seeing the ball well . I feel like I have a good approach at the plate , I feel like I 'm not trying to do too much , and good things are happening . " 	 Beltran spent the second half of the 2011 season with San Francisco after a trade from the Mets , but the Giants missed the playoffs last fall a year after the capturing an improbable championship . The orange towel - waving sellout crowd of 42,534 let him have it with boos at every opportunity -- during pregame introductions and each time he stepped into the batter 's box . 	 Both teams were well rested a day after a rough night of travel . The Giants barely beat the Cardinals to the Bay Area early Saturday after they were delayed three hours on the tarmac in Cincinnati on Friday night -- to refuel and for a mechanical problem after waiting out the Cardinals - Nationals game to know where they were headed next . 	 Matheny stuck with the same winning lineup that he sent out for Game 5 , and some of the same faces came through again . 	 " They put together some better at - bats than us , " Giants center fielder Angel Pagan said . " They hit some homers and were up 6 - 0 . That 's a pretty good lead in the playoffs . We tried to battle back . We did our best but it was n't our night . " 	 Daniel Descalso , who hit a tying , two - out single in Friday 's 9 - 7 win , added two more hits . 	 Descalso hit a one - out double in the fourth , then rookie Pete Kozma drove him home with a double of his own . In the ninth inning Friday , Kozma followed Descalso with a go - ahead , two - run single . 	 Descalso did well playing in his native Northern California . He spends his offseasons in San Francisco 's Marina district . 	 Beltran and Freese each had two strikes when they homered . 	 " I think that 's been very much of a strong suit for us all season , " Matheny said . " And it 's a beautiful thing when these guys trust themselves when they get to two strikes . They can be a little more selective early in the count and then they 're not going to panic when we do get to two strikes . I give the guys a lot of credit . " 	 St. Louis 18 - game winner Lynn did n't allow a hit until Marco Scutaro 's single to left leading off the fourth . Hunter Pence singled two outs later and Brandon Belt drove him home with a single . Gregor Blanco followed with a two - run triple , then Brandon Crawford hit an RBI double . Pinch hitter Aubrey Huff -- a 2010 postseason star now in a diminished role -- drew a walk to cheers of " Aubrey ! Aubrey ! " 	 And , just like that , Lynn was done . 	 " The bullpen did a great job , " catcher Yadier Molina said . " We struck first , and to hold that lead , we won with the bullpen . " 	 Bumgarner and Lynn each lasted only 3 2/3 innings . That made for a long night in both bullpens . 	 The pressure is now on for the Giants not to fall behind 2 - 0 at home again . They lost the first two games of their division series here to the Reds last weekend before winning three in a row at Cincinnati . They went 48 - 33 at AT&T Park this season . 	 " We 've shown how resilient we can be , " manager Bruce Bochy said . " We hate to lose them at home , but it happens . And we 've got to wash this one off and come out and be ready to go tomorrow . " 	 Bumgarner , a 16 - game winner for the NL West champs , lost Game 2 of the division series at home to the Reds exactly a week earlier . 	 He pitched a 1 - 2 - 3 first on Sunday but ran into trouble in the second when Molina singled on an 0 - 2 pitch with one out . Freese then drove a 3 - 2 pitch over the wall in left - center to give the Cardinals a 2 - 0 lead . 	 Bumgarner needed 30 pitches to get through the second , and now has an 11.25 ERA in his two postseason starts this year . 	 Lynn returned to the rotation for the NLCS and his first career postseason start after making four relief appearances in the division series . Matheny needed another starter after left - hander Jaime Garcia injured his left shoulder in Game 2 against the Nationals . 	 " Right now we feel like everyone 's feeding off each other , " reliever Joe Kelly said . " If one guy does something , you want to go out and match it and try to keep that momentum going . It shows the confidence that Mike has in this bullpen . It makes us want to play better for him . He hands the ball off and he knows what he 's doing . " 	 Game notes 	  Matheny caught for the Giants in 2005 - 06 . ... Freese 's two RBIs gave him 25 for his postseason career , tied with Molina for third most on the Cardinals . Albert Pujols is No . 1 with 52 and Jim Edmonds has 41 . ... Both teams kept their rosters intact from the division series . ... The clubs split their season series 3 - all . ... Giants assistant batting coach Joe Lefebvre took over 1B coaching duties in place of Roberto Kelly , who sustained a concussion after being hit by a ball off Buster Posey 's bat during batting practice Saturday . ... Matheny received a nice ovation during pregame introductions . ... More fans packed the viewing portwalk outside the ballpark beneath the right - field arcade .

SAN FRANCISCO -- The sight of Marco Scutaro on the ground in pain after getting flattened by Matt Holliday 's hard takeout was just the spark the San Francisco Giants needed . 	 Scutaro even got into the act with his own big blow that helped the Giants end their home slide . 	 Scutaro hit a two - run single in San Francisco 's four - run fourth inning before leaving with a hip injury and the Giants got their first home win this postseason , 7 - 1 over the St. Louis Cardinals on Monday night to tie the NL Championship Series at one game apiece . 	 " It just kind of pumps you up , " Giants outfielder Hunter Pence said . " When you see one of your guys go down , you always want to win the game , but it 's like , ' Let 's go . Let 's put it on the scoreboard . ' " 	 Scutaro left after the fifth because of his damaged left hip on a play Giants manager Bruce Bochy felt was illegal . X - rays were negative , and Scutaro likely will get an MRI on Tuesday . There was no word on his future status . 	 " In hindsight , I wish I would have started the slide a little earlier , but it happened so fast , " Holliday said . " I hope he 's OK , he 's a good guy . I was more interested in breaking up the double play . " 	 The series now shifts to St. Louis for three games , starting with Game 3 on Wednesday when San Francisco ace Matt Cain takes on Kyle Lohse of the Cardinals . 	 Things got off to a testy start when Holliday barreled into Scutaro at second base to break up a potential double play in the first inning . The play riled up an AT&T Park crowd that had seen three straight losses by the Giants so far this postseason . 	 There was plenty to cheer all night for the Giants . Ryan Vogelsong pitched seven strong innings , Angel Pagan hit a leadoff homer to give San Francisco its first home lead this postseason , and Scutaro broke the game open with his single off Chris Carpenter . 	 " That shows you how tough he is , " Bochy said . " I really think they got away with an illegal slide there . That rule was changed a while back . And he really did n't hit dirt until he was past the bag . Marco was behind the bag and got smoked . It 's a shame somebody got hurt because of this . That 's more of a roadblock . " 	 Making Scutaro 's hit even sweeter for the Giants was the fact that Holliday misplayed the ball in left field , allowing a third run to score on the error . 	 " There 's baseball gods . There 's definitely baseball gods , " former Giants first baseman Will Clark said . " There 's a reason why he hits a ( single ) and Holliday boots the ball he hit . Baseball gods shine in weird ways . " 	 The Giants also benefited from a missed call by an umpire in the eighth inning after St. Louis center fielder Jon Jay made a spectacular , diving catch to rob Brandon Crawford of a hit . 	 Jay threw toward first and the Cardinals should have gotten a double play , but first - base umpire Bill Miller did not see Allen Craig tag Gregor Blanco 's jersey as he raced back to first on the play . 	 St. Louis manager Mike Matheny argued the call and the umpires huddled to discuss it , but they kept the safe call even though replays showed Craig made the tag . The Giants capitalized when Ryan Theriot hit a two - run single to make it 7 - 1 . 	 " I 'm not going to take a hard stance one way or another on the replay , " Matheny said . 	 " That really was n't the game today , " he said . " But every once in a while there 's a big play that does change the course of the game and I 'm not against having something else to help get it right . Our guys work hard to make the right plays and execute , so we want things called fairly . " 	 Back at Busch Stadium , Holliday will be cheered after being the target of boos all night following his aggressive play on the basepaths . 	 With runners on first and second and one out , Craig hit a bouncer to Crawford , and the shortstop quickly flipped to Scutaro for the forceout . 	 Holliday , a former high school football star in Oklahoma , came tumbling in and slid late into Scutaro , crushing his left leg to prevent up the double play . Scutaro lay on the ground twisting in pain while trainer Dave Groeschner and Bochy ran out of the dugout to attend to the second baseman . 	 " A lot of guys take pride in breaking up double plays . Holliday is one of them , " Cardinals second baseman Daniel Descalso said . " On slowly hit balls you 're going to get hit . You do n't want anyone to get hurt , but I 'm all for playing the game hard . " 	 Vogelsong got out of the jam by retiring Yadier Molina on a groundout . 	 " I just really was trying to make the next pitch to get the guy out so we could get him in the dugout , " Vogelsong said . 	 Scutaro stayed in the game with a limp until being replaced in the sixth by Theriot . By then , he had done his damage with the bat in the big fourth inning . 	 The rally started innocently enough with a bloop , opposite - field double by Brandon Belt and a chopper over third baseman David Freese by Blanco . Crawford then hit a bouncer between the mound and first base that Carpenter fielded and threw away toward first base . It appeared Crawford may have impeded Carpenter by running inside the baseline but the Cardinals did not argue the play . 	 With the bases loaded and two outs , Scutaro lined his single to left - center that Holliday misplayed to the delight of Giants fans , putting Carpenter and the Cardinals into a 5 - 1 hole . 	 " He 's a clutch hitter , he always has been , I know that since he 's been over here , " Carpenter said . " He 's not going to miss those opportunities . " 	 Vogelsong made the lead hold up by becoming the first Giants starter to make it through six innings this postseason . He allowed four hits and one run for his first career postseason win . 	 These teams have a history of contentious meetings in the NLCS from Jeffrey Leonard 's one - flap down home run trot in 1987 that riled up the Cardinals to a benches - clearing dustup 10 years ago when St. Louis reliever Mike Crudale buzzed Kenny Lofton after he showboated on a home run . 	 San Francisco answered with the bats this time as Pagan led off the bottom of the first with a homer -- matching his feat from Game 4 of the division series against Cincinnati . The Giants had been outscored 20 - 6 and never led in two home losses to the Reds and the Game 1 defeat to the Cardinals . 	 Pagan 's shot came soon after Scutaro was wiped out . 	 " We felt for him , " Pagan said . " We felt a little bit of anger . I have n't seen the replay , so I ca n't judge if it was dirty or not . Anytime you see a teammate fall down like that , you really feel for him . " 	 The Cardinals tied it in the second inning when Pete Kozma drew a two - out walk and scored on Carpenter 's RBI double , his third hit already this postseason . 	 But Carpenter , making his fifth appearance in 2012 after complicated surgery to remove a rib and two neck muscles , was n't nearly as sharp on the mound or in the field . He allowed five runs -- two earned -- and six hits in four innings , failing to add to his 10 career postseason wins . 	 Philadelphia 's Jimmy Rollins is the only other player with two leadoff homers in a single postseason , doing it in 2008 . ... Cardinals OF Carlos Beltran reached base three times , doubling twice and walking once . ... Giants 3B coach Tim Flannery performed the national anthem with the Grateful Dead 's Bob Weir and Phil Lesh . ... Vogelsong doubled in the sixth to become the first Giants pitcher to get a postseason extra - base hit since Jack Bentley homered in the 1924 World Series . 	 Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year . 	 From MVP to Cy Young and more , this is your one - stop shop as baseball 's 2021 hardware is handed out . 	 Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season , leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR . 	 Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India 's 2021 campaign . 	 Julio Lugo , who played for seven teams in a 12 - year major league career , has died . He was 45 . 	 Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers .

DETROIT -- Justin Verlander and Detroit 's stellar starters are on quite a roll -- no matter who is in the opposing lineup . 	 Verlander took a shutout into the ninth inning and the Tigers held on to beat New York 2 - 1 Tuesday night for a 3 - 0 lead in the AL Championship Series . Yankees manager Joe Girardi changed his batting order again , benching Alex Rodriguez and Nick Swisher in an effort to snap his team out of an untimely hitting funk . 	 No such luck . 	 " I have seen a lot of teams shuffle around a lot of lineups when I am out there , so it does n't really faze me one way or the other if those guys are in there or not , " Verlander said . " I just need to come up with the game plan to face the certain guys that I am going to face . I ca n't say I was surprised , but that 's Girardi 's decision , not mine . " 	 Phil Coke gave up consecutive singles with two outs in the ninth before striking out postseason star Raul Ibanez for his second save in two games . Detroit can complete a sweep and earn its second pennant in seven years Wednesday night when Max Scherzer pitches against Yankees ace CC Sabathia . 	 " We put ourselves in a decent position , but that 's all we have done , " Tigers manager Jim Leyland said . 	 Verlander allowed only a pair of singles by Ichiro Suzuki and a leadoff homer by Eduardo Nunez in the ninth . Delmon Young hit a solo home run for the Tigers , and Miguel Cabrera had an RBI double . 	 Yankees starter Phil Hughes was lifted in the fourth because of a stiff back , but right now it 's the Yankees ' hitting that has them on the brink of elimination . New York is batting .182 for the series and .200 during the postseason . 	 " There were some good at - bats tonight . The ball was not carrying tremendously well tonight , we know that , " Girardi said . " But I think he ended up with three strikeouts . So our guys put the ball in play and tried to get on base , but , you know , when you face Verlander , you know what you 're up against . " 	 Seeking their first World Series title since 1984 , the Tigers were on a historic pitching run even before their ace took the mound Tuesday . With the exception of a four - run ninth inning against Detroit closer Jose Valverde in Game 1 , New York had been shut out for the entire series . 	 Nunez 's homer snapped a scoreless streak by Detroit starters of 30 1/3 innings . That 's a record for a single postseason , according to STATS LLC . The previous mark of 29 innings was set by Oakland in 1974 . 	 Verlander fell just short of a second straight shutout after stopping the Athletics in the decisive fifth game of the division series . He struck out only three but kept New York off the scoreboard until the homer to left field by Nunez , the first run allowed by the powerful right - hander since he gave up a leadoff homer to Coco Crisp in Game 1 of the ALDS . 	 Nunez was at shortstop because Derek Jeter broke his ankle in Game 1 and will miss the rest of the season . 	 Verlander got Brett Gardner on a tapper before he was lifted after 132 pitches , one shy of his career high set in Game 5 of last year 's ALCS against Texas . 	 " Normally , I guess you do n't take Secretariat out in the final furlong , but that was pretty much it for him , " Leyland said . 	 Coke came in and allowed two - out hits to Mark Teixeira and Robinson Cano , with the latter snapping a drought of 29 at - bats without a hit . 	 An anxious Verlander paced in the dugout and rubbed the bald head of a teammate before Ibanez , who hit tying and winning homers in the same game in the ALDS against Baltimore and tied Game 1 of this series with a homer in the ninth , struck out swinging at a breaking ball to end it . 	 " I 've got faith in our bullpen . Coke did a great job in New York . He 's done a great job for us all year , so I was OK with it , " Verlander said . " And I was up around 130 pitches or so , so I do n't think they 're just going to leave me out there and sacrifice the rest of the postseason just for this game , especially when Coke 's been throwing the ball extremely well . " 	 The game ended with Swisher on deck to pinch - hit , not Rodriguez . Girardi said he let Ibanez bat because he has been coming through with big hits and he figured the Tigers could replace Coke with right - hander Joaquin Benoit if a pinch - hitter came up . 	 Rodriguez also was benched for Game 5 against Baltimore after he was pulled for pinch - hitters in the previous two games . A - Rod is 3 - for-23 ( .130 ) without an RBI or extra - base hit this postseason , his latest October flop . The numbers are especially ugly against right - handers : 0 - for-18 with 12 strikeouts . 	 The three - time AL MVP was not available to reporters before or after the game . 	 Verlander , the reigning AL MVP and Cy Young Award winner , nearly became the first pitcher in 24 years to throw consecutive shutouts in the postseason , according to STATS LLC . Orel Hershiser did it for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1988 , blanking the New York Mets in Game 7 of the NL Championship Series and the Oakland Athletics in Game 2 of the World Series . 	 Valverde 's meltdown nearly cost Detroit the first game of this series , but the Tigers were able to win 6 - 4 in 12 innings . Coke closed out a 3 - 0 victory in Game 2 and was able to hold on Tuesday in a tense final inning . 	 Hughes matched Verlander in a scoreless duel until Young led off the Detroit fourth with a line drive over the wall in left field . It was his seventh homer in the past two postseasons -- he 's already the Tigers ' career leader in that department . 	 " I knew I hit it hard enough , but we were n't in Yankee Stadium , so I had to wait an extra 30 feet for it to land , " Young said . 	 Andy Dirks followed with a walk , and Hughes was pulled with an 0 - 2 count on Jhonny Peralta . David Phelps came on and got out of the inning , but the Yankees now have a pitching injury to go along with all their hitting problems . 	 " We will see how he is tomorrow and we 'll see what we have tomorrow , which will determine what we do , " Girardi said . 	 Hughes allowed a run and three hits in three - plus innings . He walked three and struck out one . 	 " It started to tighten up on me in the third . It was n't too bad and I was trying to stay in the game , but they decided with the way things were going to go to the bullpen , " Hughes said . " I wanted to stay in . It was n't so bad that I could n't pitch . Joe did n't want to take any chances . " 	 The Yankees kept it close , dodging several Detroit rallies . The Tigers added an unearned run in the fifth when Eric Chavez -- Rodriguez 's replacement at third -- misplayed a grounder . Cabrera , the AL Triple Crown winner , followed with an RBI double . 	 Cabrera has a 16 - game hitting streak in LCS play , breaking a tie for that record with Manny Ramirez and Pete Rose , according to STATS . 	 Cabrera hit into a double play with the bases loaded in the sixth , preventing the Tigers from adding more runs . 	 The Tigers sent RHP Marcelo Carreno and cash to the Cubs to complete an Aug. 5 trade in which Detroit acquired utility man Jeff Baker from Chicago . ... Cabrera moved from his usual third base spot to where the shortstop would normally play as part of a defensive shift against Teixeira in the fourth -- then had to run all the way back to catch a popup in foul ground . ... Nunez 's homer snapped a streak of 37 innings by Detroit starters without allowing an earned run , the longest in a single postseason in the live - ball era . The starters for the 1905 New York Giants threw 44 straight innings without allowing an earned run for the postseason record , according to STATS . 	 Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year . 	 From MVP to Cy Young and more , this is your one - stop shop as baseball 's 2021 hardware is handed out . 	 Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season , leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR . 	 Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India 's 2021 campaign . 	 Julio Lugo , who played for seven teams in a 12 - year major league career , has died . He was 45 . 	 Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers .

ST . LOUIS --   Matt Carpenter always tries to stay ready , keeping an assortment of gloves nearby . That 's his job . 	 The St. Louis Cardinals ' utilityman took on a new role in Game 3 of the NL Championship Series : game - changer . 	 Carpenter hit a two - run homer after subbing for Carlos Beltran , and the Cardinals chased Matt Cain before a 3½-hour rain delay in the seventh inning of a 3 - 1 victory over the San Francisco Giants on Wednesday night for a 2 - 1 series lead . 	 " It was definitely a surprise , " Carpenter said . " I did n't even realize Carlos had hurt himself ; there was really no thought process . 	 " I was in the game before I had time to think about it . " 	 Beltran strained his left knee running out a double - play ball in the first inning , and the Cardinals said he was day to day . He 's had issues off and on with the knee throughout the season , but played in 151 games and had 619 at - bats , his most since 2008 . 	 Kyle Lohse worked around a season - worst five walks in 5 2 - 3 innings . Mitchell Boggs struck out Hunter Pence and Brandon Belt with two on to end the seventh . Jason Motte earned the first two - inning save of his career to reward what remained of a sellout crowd of 45,850 that stuck around -- perhaps a third -- for a game that lasted 3 hours , 2 minutes , about a half - hour shorter than the delay . 	 " They said if we did n't score , I was going to go out there . I was in the clubhouse running around ; I 've never really had to sit around like that , " Motte said . " It was probably the most nervous I 've ever been . " 	 Giants second baseman Marco Scutaro had two hits and a clean game in the field , two days after Matt Holliday rammed him breaking up a double play . Manager Bruce Bochy had said there would be no retaliation , and Game 3 was collision - free . 	 " I 'm sure he was gutting it out , " Bochy said of Scutaro . " He was determined to play and made a pretty good recovery . " 	 Bochy said Scutaro made the right play going to first on a run - scoring groundout by Shane Robinson that made it 3 - 1 in the seventh . 	 " Well , I do n't think he had a play at home . It would have been close , " Bochy said . " You ca n't have a better or smarter second baseman than Marco . " 	 The big winners in a delay that featured about a half hour without rain while officials awaited a second , smaller front : beer vendors , by a single out . Alcohol sales are cut off after the seventh inning in all stadiums . 	 Cain lost for the second time this postseason , giving up three runs on five hits in 6 1 - 3 innings . The Giants , who entered the game batting just .217 in the postseason , were 0 for 7 with runners in scoring position . 	 Pence , the Giants ' fifth - place hitter , also grounded into a double play with runners on first and third in the third and grounded into a force play with a man on to end the fifth . 	 " I 'm the goat tonight , " Pence said . " I just did n't the job done . " 	 The Cardinals snapped the Giants ' five - game road winning streak in the postseason , three of them this year . Game 4 is in St. Louis on Thursday night , with Adam Wainwright pitching for the Cardinals . Tim Lincecum will start for the Giants . 	 " He 's a guy we want out there . He 's been throwing the ball well , " Bochy said . " We 've got to bounce back . " 	 Bochy said lefty Barry Zito will pitch Game 5 against Lance Lynn , leaving lefty Madison Bumgarner out of the mix for now . 	 " I think we feel that it 's time to give Madison a little break , " Bochy said . 	 Carpenter followed Jon Jay 's two - out single with a homer off Cain in his first at - bat of the NLCS . 	 Beltran is batting .400 in the postseason with three homers and six RBIs , but Carpenter had big numbers against Cain . He was 4 for 4 for his career against Cain , four singles . 	 " Really , there 's no explanation , " Carpenter said . " He 's one of the best in the game , obviously , I think we all know that . " 	 Cain was ahead 0 - 2 in the count and Carpenter worked it back to 2 - 2 before jumping on a hanging slider . 	 " I try to grind out those at - bats and fight , " Carpenter said . " I was in my two - strike mode and I got the pitch . You do n't expect things like that to happen . " 	 This one was a much bigger deal , a drive that soared over the Cardinals bullpen in right field and was estimated at 421 feet . 	 " It was bad pitch . I was trying to go slider in and I did n't get it in there like I should have , " Cain said . " I made a bad pitch and it cost us . " 	 Cain was aware Carpenter had hit him well . 	 " It might affect what you 're trying to do because you do n't know his weaknesses , " Cain said . " But you 've still got to make good pitches and that 's what I failed to do . " 	 Carpenter entered the game 1 for 5 in the postseason , all five pinch - hit appearances . He had an RBI single in the wild - card playoff against Atlanta . He got 14 of his 46 RBIs in April as the primary sub at first base for injured Lance Berkman . 	 On Tuesday , Carpenter was among a group of seldom - used hitters trying to stay sharp by facing Jake Westbrook in a simulated game . The rest of the team had the day off . 	 Umpires called for the tarpaulin right after the Cardinals made it 3 - 1 on a run - scoring single by Robinson and Cain was lifted . 	 It was the third game delayed by rain this postseason and a fourth , Game 4 of the Yankees - Tigers ALCS , was postponed later Wednesday night . Two games between the Yankees and Orioles in Baltimore began late because of inclement weather . 	 The rain intensified less than 10 minutes after the field was covered , chasing most fans who had remained in their seats to that point . Spotters for the National Weather Service reported 60 mph winds in nearby St. Charles County . 	 A highlight of the delay was a Pac - Man style chase . Ushers pursued and finally apprehended a fan who jumped out of the stands to get a baseball near the warning track in left field , and then jutted in and out of aisles to elude several ushers who had been closing in . 	 The storm had been widely anticipated . Some forecasts called for a 70 percent chance of rain . Both managers fielded questions Tuesday and Wednesday about whether the probability of precipitation would affect their selection of the starting pitcher . 	 Both said they could n't worry about the weather , and the starters combined for 208 pitches . 	 " I 've been caught before where you try to predict what 's going to happen with the rain and started , " Bochy said . " Just a couple years ago I started a pitcher thinking the same thing and it did n't rain for four or five innings . Then I put my starter in and then it started raining , and so it came back to bite me . " 	 Lohse is 2 - 1 with a 1.96 ERA this postseason despite uncustomary control woes . He was among the majors ' best control pitchers this season , averaging 1.62 walks per nine innings . 	 The Giants entered 70 - 22 when scoring first , including the postseason , and took the lead in the third on Pablo Sandoval 's run - scoring groundout after leadoff hits by Angel Pagan and Scutaro , whose legs looked just fine on an opposite - field double flared just over first baseman Allen Craig 's glove . 	 Beltran leads all players with eight extra - base hits in the 2012 playoffs and is a career .375 hitter in the postseason , highest among players with a minimum of 100 at - bats . 	 Game notes 	  Danny Cox , who pitched for Cardinals World Series teams in 1985 and 1987 , threw a perfect strike on the first pitch . ... According to STATS LLC , Lohse walked two batters in the same inning four times in 2012 . ... Jay , who was hit by a pitch to start the game , was plunked 15 times in the regular season . ... Matheny had 122 lineups during the regular season but has stuck with the same eight throughout the postseason . ...   The Cardinals are 9 - 2 in Game 3 of the NLCS , the lone losses coming in 2004 and ' 05 at Houston . This win ended a streak of scoring at least six runs in the past eight postseason victories dating to Game 3 of the World Series last year , the longest streak of its kind in postseason history . St. Louis entered averaging 7.6 runs in 16 wins the last two postseasons and just 2.3 runs in the 10 losses . ... The Cardinals have played in eight best - of - seven series in which they were tied 1 - 1 and played Game 3 at home , and have won all of them . They won six of the previous seven series , according to STATS LLC . 	 Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year . 	 From MVP to Cy Young and more , this is your one - stop shop as baseball 's 2021 hardware is handed out . 	 Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season , leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR . 	 Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India 's 2021 campaign . 	 Julio Lugo , who played for seven teams in a 12 - year major league career , has died . He was 45 . 	 Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers .

DETROIT --   Prince Fielder waved his arms frantically , gleefully calling off his teammates while the crowd at Comerica Park roared . 	 From the moment the big first baseman signed his massive contract in January , an entire city had been waiting for a chance to celebrate like this . After another dazzling effort by Detroit 's starting pitchers and another soaring home run by Miguel Cabrera , Fielder caught the final out to send the Tigers to the World Series -- with a sweep of the New York Yankees , no less . 	 " There 's still a long way to go but this is an awesome feeling , " Fielder said . 	 Max Scherzer capped a stupendous stretch for Detroit 's rotation , and the Tigers won their second pennant in seven years by beating the Yankees 8 - 1 on Thursday for a four - game sweep of the AL championship series . 	 Cabrera and Jhonny Peralta hit two - run homers in a four - run fourth inning against CC Sabathia , who was unable to prevent the Yankees from getting swept in a postseason series for the first time in 32 years . 	 " Yeah , we did it , " Cabrera said . " It 's an unbelievable feeling . ... Four more wins , guys . Four more wins . " 	 Scherzer took a no - hit bid into the sixth against a starting lineup that was again without Alex Rodriguez , who flied out with two on in the sixth as a pinch hitter . 	 Austin Jackson added a solo shot in the seventh for Detroit , and Peralta hit another homer an inning later . 	 The game ended with Fielder , Detroit 's $ 214 million acquisition , catching Jayson Nix 's popup . The Tigers spilled onto the field for a celebration that began near second base and eventually moved closer to the third - base line . 	 General manager Dave Dombrowski hugged Jim Leyland -- who is in the final year of his contract -- while owner Mike Ilitch rubbed the 67 - year - old manager 's right shoulder . 	 " I 've got a great bunch . We do n't have one hot dog in the bunch , " the pizza magnate said . " They 're all great guys . ... The Tigers are something special . " 	 ... The Tigers are something special . " 	 Detroit won its 11th American League pennant and first since 2006 . The Tigers have five days off before the World Series starts Wednesday at defending champion St. Louis or 2010 winner San Francisco . 	 After scoring in just three of 39 innings during the series , New York headed home to face unpleasant questions about its future after a postseason of awful hitting , benched stars and veterans showing the wear and tear of age . Rodriguez , the $ 275 million third baseman , was out of the starting lineup for the third time in the playoffs . Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera could only watch following season - ending injuries . 	 The Yankees , with a big league - high $ 222 million payroll , hit .188 in the postseason -- a record low for a team that played at least seven games -- and .157 in the LCS . New York went quietly in the ninth inning , with the Comerica crowd chanting " Sweep ! " while the last three batters were retired in order . 	 Detroit outhit New York 16 - 2 in the finale and 46 - 22 in the series . The Tigers ' starters are 4 - 1 with a 1.02 ERA in this postseason . 	 Without a World Series title since 1984 , Detroit lost to Texas in last year 's ALCS , lost slugger Victor Martinez to a season - ending knee injury in January and quickly replaced his offense by signing Fielder . The excitement of that bold acquisition subsided a bit when the Tigers struggled to a 26 - 32 start in the AL Central , but they overtook the Chicago White Sox in the final 10 days of the regular season and won the division with an 88 - 74 record , matching the Cardinals for the fewest wins among the 10 playoff teams . 	 " I just reminded everybody when we took our punches all year , ' You know what ? Let 's just wait till the end , and then if we have underachieved , I will be the first one to admit it , " Leyland said . " So hopefully we 've quieted some doubters now . The guys just stepped it up when we had to . We caught a couple breaks when the White Sox could n't win a couple of games they needed to win . " 	 In the postseason , Detroit 's rotation has been impeccable . Scherzer , Justin Verlander , Anibal Sanchez and Doug Fister allowed only two earned runs against the Yankees . New York was shut out once and totaled six runs in the series . 	 " Unbelievable . It 's why we 're here right now because our pitching , " Cabrera said . " Wow ! " 	 Scherzer allowed a run and two hits in 5 2/3 innings in the finale , struck out 10 and walked two . 	 " I really had my changeup and my slider going , " he said . " When I can combine that with my fastball , that 's what makes me effective . " 	 The Yankees , without a World Series title since 2009 , lost Jeter to a broken ankle in the opening game , and the slumping Rodriguez was benched for Game 3 . He was out of the starting lineup for Game 4 too , but A - Rod did have one last chance to turn his postseason around when Scherzer was lifted for left - hander Drew Smyly with two outs in the sixth and the Tigers up 6 - 1 . 	 As Smyly finished warming up , Rodriguez popped out of the dugout to hit for Raul Ibanez , but with runners at the corners , he hit a routine fly to center field . He grounded out in the ninth , completing a 3 for 25 ( .125 ) playoffs with no RBIs . 	 New York owes the 37 - year - old Rodriguez $ 114 million over the next five years . His contract includes a provision that requires he approves trades , and he wants to stay . 	 " I love New York City and I love everything about being a Yankee , " he said . " The highs are very high and the lows are extremely low . " 	 The Yankees failed to win a game in a postseason series for only the fifth time . They had n't been swept since a best - of - five ALCS against Kansas City in 1980 . The last team to sweep four straight against them had been Cincinnati in the 1976 World Series . 	 Detroit also beat New York in the division series in 2006 and last year . The Tigers became the first team to win three straight postseason series against the Yankees , according to STATS LLC . 	 " They threw the ball really well , " Rodriguez said . " They outplayed us in every facet of the game and they were the better team . " 	 New York never led in this series -- the only other time that 's happened to the Yankees was when they were swept by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1963 World Series . The only other team to sweep an LCS without trailing at any point was the 1984 Tigers , who won three straight against Kansas City , STATS said . 	 After a rainout Wednesday , Game 4 started under a sunny sky , and Detroit immediately took the lead on series MVP Delmon Young 's RBI single . Young became the first player with four game - winning RBIs in one postseason series , STATS said . 	 Avisail Garcia drove in an unearned run in the third with a single before the Tigers broke it open in the fourth . Cabrera , the first Triple Crown winner in 45 years , made it 4 - 0 with a towering drive to left field . Peralta drove in two more runs with his shot to the same part of the ballpark . 	 After Andy Dirks doubled , Sabathia was pulled . He allowed five earned runs and 11 hits in 3 2/3 innings . 	 " It 's embarrassing to me , " Sabathia said . 	 When the fourth inning finally ended , the crowd at Comerica gave the Tigers a standing ovation , sensing that an even bigger celebration was n't too far off . 	 Scherzer made sure of that . The right - hander was terrific down the stretch for the Tigers before his throwing shoulder acted up near the end of the regular season . He made it through 5 1/3 innings in the division series against Oakland without allowing an earned run , then kept the Yankees off the scoreboard until Eduardo Nunez tripled in the sixth for New York 's first hit and scored on Nick Swisher 's double . 	 " They 're a good team with dominant pitching . Give those guys credit -- they pitched great , " Sabathia said . " And we did n't match them . We pitched good , but not great . They pitched great . " 	 Swisher , likely playing his last game with the Yankees , was 1 for 35 with runners in scoring position in his postseason career before that hit . He struck out with two on and two outs in the third . 	 About the only thing the Yankees had done well in this postseason was pitch , and Sabathia failed to keep that going . He did n't have much help from his defense . Teixeira , a four - time Gold Glove winner at first base , misplayed two grounders in the third -- one for an infield hit and one for an error . 	 New York 's hitting was abysmal throughout the playoffs . Robinson Cano was at .075 ( 3 for 40 ) with no home runs , including a 29 at - bat hitless streak . Curtis Granderson was 3 for 30 with 16 strikeouts , Nick Swisher hit .167 ( 5 for 30 ) with two RBIs , Russell Martin hit .161 ( 5 for 31 ) with one RBI and Eric Chavez finished 0 for 16 with eight strikeouts . 	 " It was n't one guy . It was n't two guys , " Yankees manager Joe Girardi said . " It was a bunch of guys . " 	 Game notes 	  Detroit closer Jose Valverde , who allowed four runs in Game 1 , did not pitch again in the series . ... Cabrera has a hit in a record 17 straight LCS games . He 's reached base in all 20 of his postseason games with the Tigers , a team record . ... Sabathia was 4 - 0 in his previous eight postseason starts . ... Thursday was the 35th anniversary of Reggie Jackson 's three - homer game for the Yankees in the World Series against the Dodgers . ... New York scored seven runs at Baltimore in the division series opener , then was held to four or fewer in the next eight games . The Yankees ' longest previous stretch like that in postseason play came in 2001 , when they were held to four or fewer runs in all seven games of the World Series by Arizona . 	 Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season , leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR . 	 Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India 's 2021 campaign . 	 From MVP to Cy Young and more , this is your one - stop shop as baseball 's 2021 hardware is handed out . 	 Julio Lugo , who played for seven teams in a 12 - year major league career has died . He was 45 . 	 Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year . 	 The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third - base coach on Monday .

ST . LOUIS -- The St. Louis Cardinals are oh so close . They know better than to start celebrating yet . 	 To a man , the defending World Series champions kept their latest victory in perspective Thursday night . Before cashing in another wild - card run to a second straight pennant , they 've still got to beat the San Francisco Giants one more time . 	 " We 're not taking the last game to get into the World Series for granted , " Matt Holliday said after an 8 - 3 win put St. Louis up 3 - 1 in the best - of - seven National League Championship Series with a chance to wrap it up at home . " The Giants have proven they 're a great team , and they had their backs to the wall against the Reds . " 	 Seated next to Holliday on the podium , Adam Wainwright chimed in : " Well said . " 	 The Giants won three straight to eliminate Cincinnati in the division series . Now they have to do it again against a team that appears to have everything working . 	 " They do have something , there 's no getting around that , " San Francisco manager Bruce Bochy said . " It 's not over . We 've been in this position . We know it 's an uphill battle , but we 've been here before . " 	 The Giants are in a hole after Wainwright threw seven innings of four - hit ball , and St. Louis ' offense roughed up Tim Lincecum and the San Francisco bullpen . 	 " This is where we are and what we 've got to deal with , " Hunter Pence said . " The last series , we were down in a similar situation , but this is a new series . " 	 The Cardinals can close it out at home Friday night in Game 5 . Lance Lynn faces Giants lefty Barry Zito , and a St. Louis win would set up a 2006 World Series rematch with Detroit . 	 Plus , the Cardinals could have Carlos Beltran back in the lineup . Beltran missed virtually all of Games 3 and 4 with a left knee strain but is optimistic about playing in Game 5 after doing some jogging and hitting indoors Thursday . 	 " Right now , the plan is to come in tomorrow and do what I have to do in order to be in the lineup , " said Beltran , who is batting .375 in the postseason with three homers and six RBIs . " Today was a better day for me , better than yesterday . 	 " Tomorrow is the day I need to go for it . " 	 Holliday , Jon Jay and Yadier Molina had two RBIs apiece to lead a 12 - hit outburst by a team that batted just .198 through the first three games of the series . 	 Lincecum was a bust in his first postseason start since the 2010 World Series clincher over Texas , giving up four runs in 4 2/3 innings . 	 " That second inning was a little bit laborious , but the third and fourth were a little bit better , and I thought I was going to carry it further in the game , " Lincecum said . " I ran into some bumps in that fifth . " 	 The two - time Cy Young Award winner with the quirky delivery earned a shot based on nearly spotless relief work earlier in the postseason but reverted to regular - season form , when he was 10 - 15 with a 5.18 ERA , worst among qualifying starters in the NL . 	 Wainwright was a glorified cheerleader while rehabbing from reconstructive elbow surgery during the Cardinals ' improbable title drive last fall . They earned the wild card on the final day of the season , and then upset the favored Phillies , Brewers and Rangers to give manager Tony La Russa a chance to retire on top . 	 Under rookie manager Mike Matheny , the 88 - win Cardinals were the final team to qualify this year , too . Once again , they 've stepped up their game . 	 Wainwright bounced back from a poor outing in Game 5 of the NL division series against Washington , striking out five and walking none for his first postseason victory as a starter . 	 " It was a big motivator , " he said . " I know that I 'm good enough to pitch in the postseason , to carry this team deep into the game , give them a quality game , a quality outing . Last time I did n't do it , but I knew tonight if I just believed in myself and went out there and executed pitches I would be in good shape . " 	 The lone damage against Wainwright came on Pence 's first homer and RBI of the postseason , a second - inning clout estimated at 451 feet that soared over the visitors ' bullpen into the left - center bleachers to cut the Cardinals ' lead to 2 - 1 . 	 Now , the 14 - game winner can just about taste his first World Series as an active player since striking out Brandon Inge as the stand - in closer for injured Jason Isringhausen in the 2006 clincher over the Tigers . 	 " This whole experience is so special as it is , " Wainwright said . " But to get back to that World Series is always the way to go . " 	 Holliday was n't surprised by Wainwright 's strong performance . 	 " You expect Adam to pitch well and pitch like an ace , and he did , " Holliday said . " His curveball was really good . He located his fastball . No surprise . We all expect Adam to pitch the way he pitched tonight , but sometimes things like the Washington game happen . But he 's tough as nails . We knew he 'd pitch well . " 	 Just 12 pitches in , the Cardinals had two hits and the lead , and Lincecum got a visit from pitching coach Dave Righetti . Jay opened the first with a single , Matt Carpenter walked on four pitches and Holliday singled up the middle for the lead . Allen Craig tacked on a sacrifice fly . 	 Lincecum escaped trouble in the second after issuing two more walks , one of them on five pitches to Wainwright . The Cardinals missed a chance to add on after Pete Kozma reached on third baseman Pablo Sandoval 's fielding error to open the inning when he was thrown out trying to steal . 	 Lincecum had retired eight in a row before running into trouble in the fifth . 	 Carpenter doubled off the top of the wall in right - center with one out . He held up until Holliday 's single fell in front of fast - charging center fielder Angel Pagan , but third - base coach Jose Oquendo aggressively waved Carpenter home . 	 The relay from shortstop Brandon Crawford was in time , but it short - hopped catcher Hector Sanchez and Carpenter scored on a headfirst slide to make it 3 - 1 . Molina 's two - out RBI single made it 4 - 1 and was the knockout blow for Lincecum . 	 " He gave us all he had out there , " Bochy said . " That was his last inning , and he was close to getting out of that inning . He made a great effort on that ball and good throw . We had him at home plate , and it 's still 2 - 1 . That 's a big play in the game . " 	 Pence , who called himself " the goat " of Game 3 after stranding seven runners , hit the second - longest home run by an opposing player at 7 - year - old Busch Stadium with a drive that sailed over the visitors ' bullpen into the bleachers in left - center . 	 Holliday 's RBI single was the first RBI by a Cardinals starter since Beltran 's two - run homer in the fourth inning of Game 1 . Holliday entered 2 - for-12 in the NLCS with no RBIs . 	 Sandoval hit a two - run homer in the ninth , but the NL West champs are on the brink of elimination . 	 " We have all the confidence in Barry , " Bochy said . " We do need to get the bats going . They 've been shutting us down . " 	 Game notes 	  Cardinals Hall of Famers Stan Musial and Ozzie Smith made pregame appearances . The 91 - year - old Musial toured the warning track in a golf cart while waving to fans , and Smith threw out the first pitch . Smith 's son , Nikko , a former " American Idol " finalist , sang the national anthem . ... With Beltran out , Matheny changed the lineup for the first time in the postseason . ... According to STATS LLC , the Giants have faced a 2 - 1 series deficit eight times in franchise history . They have lost Game 4 each time . ... Wainwright has a 2.48 ERA in 13 postseason appearances , four of them starts . 	 Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season , leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR . 	 Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India 's 2021 campaign . 	 From MVP to Cy Young and more , this is your one - stop shop as baseball 's 2021 hardware is handed out . 	 Julio Lugo , who played for seven teams in a 12 - year major league career , has died . He was 45 . 	 Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers . 	 The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third - base coach on Monday .

ST . LOUIS --   The San Francisco Giants waited quite a while for this kind of performance from Barry Zito . 	 The soft - tossing lefty was at his best Friday night , pitching San Francisco back into the NL Championship Series with a 5 - 0 win over the St. Louis Cardinals that narrowed its deficit to 3 - 2 . 	 " This is definitely it for me , " Zito said . " Coming here , especially doing it in a Giants uniform . A lot of people were saying stuff about A 's days . And for me , the most important thing is doing everything for San Francisco right now . " 	 The Giants ' win in Game 5 sent the series to San Francisco . Game 6 will begin Sunday in the twilight at AT&T Park , with Ryan Vogelsong pitching against the Cardinals ' Chris Carpenter . 	 Zito looked like the same guy who won the 2002 AL Cy Young Award with the Athletics . He retired 11 consecutive batters in one stretch while scattering six hits with six strikeouts in 7 2/3 innings . 	 Giants catcher Buster Posey twice tapped Zito on the chest when he was pulled in the eighth . It was Zito 's first postseason win since 2006 , shortly before he left the A 's and signed a $ 126 million , seven - year contract with San Francisco . 	 Zito was left off the postseason roster when the Giants won the 2010 World Series because he had pitched so ineffectively . He started Game 4 of the division series against the Reds earlier in this year 's playoffs and lasted only 2 2/3 innings . 	 " I could n't be happier for him , " manager Bruce Bochy said . " He had it all going . He put on quite a show . " 	 The defending champion Cardinals might have thrown away a chance to clinch a second straight World Series trip . Pitcher Lance Lynn 's toss on a possible forceout deflected off the second - base bag , paving the way for the Giants ' four - run fourth . 	 " I do n't mind him being aggressive if he 's got the play , " manager Mike Matheny said . " ( Shortstop Pete ) Kozma was in the right place ; he just made a low throw . 	 " And to do it over again , I 'm sure he 'd like to take the easy out at first base , " he said . 	 Pablo Sandoval homered for the second straight night and Zito made an extremely rare offensive contribution with a perfectly executed bunt for an RBI single . 	 Giants defenders made several nice plays behind Zito , including a juggling catch in right by Hunter Pence and a spectacular sliding stop by second baseman Marco Scutaro to rob pinch - hitter Shane Robinson on consecutive at - bats . 	 Once again this postseason , the Giants benefited from a big error . 	 Needing three straight wins at Cincinnati to avoid elimination in the division series , San Francisco began its comeback on a bobble by third baseman Scott Rolen in the 10th inning that gave the Giants the go - ahead run in Game 3 . 	 The Giants improved to 4 - 2 on the road this postseason and have won Zito 's past 13 starts , with the last setback on Aug. 2 . They 're averaging more than six runs a game during the streak , although the lefty did n't need much help in this one . 	 Lynn , an 18 - game winner his first year in the rotation , failed to make it out of the fourth for the second time in the series . 	 The Cardinals are seeking consecutive pennants for the first time since 1967 - 68 , and trying to advance for the second year in a row as a wild - card entry . One more win would set up a rematch of the 2006 World Series against the Tigers , which the Cardinals took in five games . 	 Lynn struck out five of the first 10 batters , sailing through the first three innings with no balls hit out of the infield . His undoing was a wild throw off the second - base bag attempting to get a forceout on a comebacker that paved the way for San Francisco 's four - run fourth . 	 The Giants had runners on first and second with one out when Lynn gloved a tapper by Pence , wheeled and waited a bit while Kozma hustled to second . But Lynn threw a low dart off the bag with the ball bounding into shallow right field and Marco Scutaro scoring without a play from second . 	 Eighth - place hitter Brandon Crawford singled up the middle with the bases loaded on a full count with two outs as Lynn just missed with a kick save for two more runs . Zito , who has just 30 career hits in 310 at - bats in the regular season with no extra - base hits and nine RBIs , laid down a perfect bunt for a fourth run . 	 Lynn has allowed four runs both of his NLCS starts , although all four were unearned in Game 5 . 	 Zito 's only trouble came in the second when Yadier Molina and David Freese , both swinging on the first pitch , opened the inning with a single and double . Lynn , a career .056 hitter including the postseason , hit into a bases - loaded double play to end the threat . 	 Lynn was 3 for 50 with 1 RBI , 10 sacrifices and 36 strikeouts during the regular season , going hitless his last 42 at - bats . 	 Game notes 	  Standing room attendance for Game 5 was 47,075 , a franchise best for league championship play , topping the previous best in Game 4 by 13 . ... Actor Matthew Morrison sang the national anthem . ... Longtime Cardinals broadcaster Mike Shannon bounced a ceremonial first pitch from in front of the mound to Lou Brock , teammates on the last St. Louis team to go to consecutive World Series in 1967 and ' 68 . ... Carlos Beltran has 10 career stolen bases in the postseason . ... Matt Carpenter , who subbed for Beltran in Games 3 and 4 , is a career .529 hitter ( 9 for 17 ) against the Giants counting the postseason , with a homer and four RBIs . ... Cardinals rookie RHP Trevor Rosenthal struck out four in two scoreless innings . He has fanned 11 in 6 2/3 scoreless innings in the postseason while allowing just one hit . 	 From MVP to Cy Young and more , this is your one - stop shop as baseball 's 2021 hardware is handed out . 	 Julio Lugo , who played for seven teams in a 12 - year major league career has died . He was 45 . 	 Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year .

SAN FRANCISCO --   Chris Carpenter walked off the mound , and the fans cheered him once again . 	 Giants fans , that is . 	 The orange towel - twirling crowd at AT&T Park saw San Francisco send the St. Louis star to an early exit in a 6 - 1 win Sunday night that forced the National League Championship Series to a decisive Game 7 . 	 " The bottom line is , " Carpenter said , " I 'm not giving my team a chance to win . " 	 The Cardinals ' longtime postseason ace came back from a complicated operation that removed a rib and two neck muscles just to get on the mound again this October for the reigning World Series champions . All of that success , though , has evaporated in his last two starts in San Francisco . 	 Carpenter allowed five runs in four shaky innings -- identical to his loss earlier in Game 2 . Not what the Cardinals had come to expect from him in the postseason , a resume that includes a Game 7 win in last year 's World Series . 	 And so the wild - card Cardinals were pushed to the brink of elimination once more . They 're plenty familiar with that situation . 	 Carpenter and St. Louis won the decisive Game 5 of the division series at Philadelphia last season , then the Cardinals overcame a 3 - 2 deficit in the World Series to beat Texas . They won the winner - take - all wild - card game at Atlanta this month and rallied in the ninth at Washington in Game 5 of the division series . 	 Now they must do it again . 	 Giants ace Matt Cain will take the mound for Game 7 in San Francisco on Monday night opposite Kyle Lohse in a rematch of a rain - delayed Game 3 , which the Cardinals won in St. Louis . There 's also a rare rainy forecast for San Francisco for the clincher . 	 " We 've been in this spot before , " second baseman Daniel Descalso said . " We 're not going to be intimidated by it . " 	 If the Cardinals hope to return to the World Series , they 'll need to find some stronger pitching and defense -- and fast . 	 Not to mention a little offense , too . 	 Allen Craig 's two - out single in the sixth drove home Carlos Beltran for the Cardinals ' only run against Ryan Vogelsong , who struck out a career - high nine in seven innings of four - hit ball . St. Louis had gone 15 innings without scoring after lefty Barry Zito and Co. held it scoreless in Game 5 . 	 Carpenter allowed six hits and three unearned runs , the same as he did in Game 2 at San Francisco , except he had only one strikeout in that outing . The 10 unearned runs allowed by the Cardinals over the series is the most in NLCS history , according to STATS LLC . Two teams have allowed nine . 	 Talk about St. Louis blues . 	 " The one thing I know is these guys take these ones hard , " Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said . " We 've had a number of losses this season that felt like we 've been kicked in the gut as we 're walking off the field . And what I have admired about this club is they show up tomorrow the exact same guys that they showed up here today . " 	 They have no choice anymore . 	 The only other time the Cardinals opened a 3 - 1 lead in the NLCS came in 1996 , when they lost to the Atlanta Braves in seven games . San Francisco , which never faced an elimination game in winning the 2010 World Series title , is 5 - 0 when pushed to the edge this postseason . 	 St. Louis has won its last six games when facing elimination . After taking a 3 - 1 lead before being held scoreless in Game 5 to force the series back to San Francisco , the Cardinals were hoping to avoid having to extend that streak . 	 They Giants simply would n't let them . 	 After Marco Scutaro drew a one - out walk in the first inning , Pablo Sandoval doubled over the head of Jon Jay as the center fielder got turned around fighting the sun and shadows during the twilight start . Scutaro scored on Buster Posey 's groundout -- which third baseman David Freese bobbled on the exchange to eliminate any chance at a throw home -- to give the Giants a 1 - 0 lead . 	 With Brandon Crawford trying to steal second on the pitch , Vogelsong chopped a ball that rookie shortstop Pete Kozma could n't handle , allowing Brandon Belt to score in the second . Then Scutaro hit a two - run double to left and Sandoval singled on the 10th pitch against Carpenter to put the Giants ahead 5 - 0 . 	 Adding to the Cardinals ' concerns is the status of one of their best hitters . 	 Matt Carpenter replaced Matt Holliday in St. Louis ' lineup when the left fielder was scratched about 45 minutes before first pitch because of lower back tightness , and Matheny said after the team will have to " wait to see " on Holliday 's status for Game 7 . Carpenter started at first base and batted second , Craig shifted from first to left field and Beltran slid back a spot to third while playing right field . 	 With Vogelsong on the mound to pace San Francisco 's scintillating start and Carpenter struggling again , Holliday 's absence might not have mattered much . 	 " We 've had some games where we stack on runs and then we go absolutely hitless almost , for a while , or anything of impact , " Matheny said . " But at any day we know that our offense can pull out quite a bit of production . Hopefully it 's ( Monday ) .

SAN FRANCISCO --   After all the Giants had overcome to get back to the World Series , a late shower was n't about to dampen their celebration . 	 All right , it was a driving downpour . 	 So reliever Sergio Romo danced through the raindrops , Tim Lincecum helped lead a soaked victory lap around the ballpark and Angel Pagan stayed on the field with his daughter long after his teammates took the party indoors . 	 Hunter Pence got the Giants going with a weird double , Matt Cain pitched his second clincher of October and San Francisco closed out Game 7 of the NL Championship Series in a rainstorm , routing the St. Louis Cardinals 9 - 0 on Monday night . 	 " The rain never felt so good , " series MVP Marco Scutaro said . " We 're going to the World Series , this is unbelievable . " 	 San Francisco won its record - tying sixth elimination game of the postseason , completing a lopsided rally from a 3 - 1 deficit . 	 The Giants , who won it all in 2010 , will host reigning AL MVP and Cy Young winner Justin Verlander , Triple Crown slugger Miguel Cabrera and the Detroit Tigers in Game 1 on Wednesday night . 	 Verlander is set to pitch Wednesday 's opener at AT&T Park . Giants manager Bruce Bochy insisted before Monday 's game he had not planned any further in advance . 	 Scutaro produced his sixth multihit game of the series and matched an LCS record with 14 hits and Pablo Sandoval drove in a run for his fifth straight game . 	 " These guys never quit , " Bochy said . " They just kept believing and they got it done . " 	 After falling behind 3 - 1 in the series at Busch Stadium , the Giants outscored the wild - card Cardinals 20 - 1 over the final three games behind stellar starting pitching from Barry Zito , Ryan Vogelsong and Cain . 	 They also benefited from some strange bounces . 	 On Pence 's double that highlighted a five - run third , his bat broke at the label on impact , then the broken barrel hit the ball twice more . That put a rolling , slicing spin on the ball and caused it to change directions -- leaving shortstop Pete Kozma little chance to make the play . Kozma broke to his right , figuring that 's where the ball would go , but it instead curved to left - center . 	 " It was going to go in the hole and it ended up going up the middle , " Kozma said . 	 Injured closer Brian Wilson , with that out - of - control bushy black beard , danced in the dugout and fans in the sellout crowd of 43,056 kept twirling their orange rally towels even through rain in the late innings -- a downright downpour when Romo retired Matt Holliday on a popup to Scutaro to end it . 	 Romo embraced catcher Buster Posey as fireworks went off over McCovey Cove beyond right field . 	 " It 's just very fitting the way everything has gone for us this season , " Romo said of ending in the rain . " The ups and downs , the injuries , the personal issues , whatever . What a ride for us all . It 's very , very fitting that it rained right there . " 	 The NL West champion Giants won their first postseason clincher at home since the 2002 NLCS , also against the Cardinals . 	 These 2012 Giants have a couple of pretty talented castoffs of their own not so different from that winning combination of 2010 " castoffs and misfits " as Bochy referred to his bunch -- with Scutaro right there at the top of the list this time around . 	 Acquired July 27 from the division rival Colorado Rockies , Scutaro hit .500 ( 14 for 28 ) with four RBIs in the NLCS . The 36 - year - old journeyman infielder , playing in his second postseason and first since 2006 with Oakland , became the first player in major league history with six multihit games in an LCS . 	 Now , he 's headed to his first World Series . 	 The Giants have All - Star Game MVP Melky Cabrera to thank for helping his teammates secure home - field advantage in the postseason -- while Cain was the winning pitcher the National League 's 8 - 0 victory in July . Cabrera was suspended 50 games Aug. 15 for a positive testosterone test , then was n't added to the roster by the Giants after his suspension ended . 	 After rain fell on the Cardinals during batting practice , the skies turned blue and the weather cooperated . Anxious players on both sides hung over the dugout rails as the game began . 	 Cain joined St. Louis ' Chris Carpenter as the only pitchers with victories in two winner - take - all games in the same postseason . Carpenter , who lost Games 2 and 6 in this series , did it last year . 	 Cain also pitched the Giants ' Game 5 division series clincher at Cincinnati , when San Francisco became the first team in major league history to come back from an 0 - 2 deficit in a five - game series by winning three consecutive road games . 	 " I think to do it , the guys actually have to believe it can happen , " Posey said . 	 He delivered on an even bigger stage Monday as San Francisco saved its season once again . The Giants won their 20th NL pennant and reached their 19th World Series . 	 Cain walked off the mound to a standing ovation when Jeremy Affeldt entered with two outs in the sixth . Affeldt then got Daniel Descalso to pop out with two runners on . 	 Yadier Molina had four hits but got little help from the rest of the Cardinals , who went 1 for 21 with runners in scoring position over their final three games . 	 " It 's about the team that 's hot , and we went on a cold streak , " Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said . " We got to this point by being that team that was hot and taking advantage of opportunities . But we just could n't make it happen these last two games . " 	 Cain added an RBI single to his cause and got some sparkling defense behind him . 	 The play of the game went to shortstop Brandon Crawford , who made a leaping catch of Kyle Lohse 's liner to end the second inning with runners on second and third that would have been a run - scoring hit . 	 In the third , Scutaro , the second baseman , made a tough stop on a short hop by Carlos Beltran , and left fielder Gregor Blanco ran down a hard - hit ball by Allen Craig in left - center to end the inning . 	 Cain 's second - inning single made San Francisco the first team in major league postseason history to have a starting pitcher drive in a run in three straight elimination games . 	 Brandon Belt hit a solo homer in the eighth for his first clout of the postseason . 	 It took production from everybody , even the pitchers , for these scrappy Giants to rally back from the brink one more time . 	 Cain certainly did his part to keep the staff rolling . 	 The 16 - game winner , who did n't surrender an earned run during his team 's title run two years ago , reached 46 pitches through two innings but settled in nicely the rest of the way to avenge a loss to Lohse in Game 3 . 	 Cain even got to repay Holliday for his hard slide into Scutaro at second base in Game 2 here a week earlier . Cain plunked Holliday in the upper left arm leading off the sixth , drawing cheers from the crowd . After the game , Cain said that he was n't trying to hit Holliday with the 0 - 2 pitch . 	 " Just trying to go in right there , and it got away , " Cain said , according to the Sacramento Bee . 	 The right - hander escaped trouble in the second with runners on second and third when Crawford made his catch . 	 Holliday returned to the lineup after missing Game 6 a night earlier with tightness in his lower back . He received loud boos when he stepped in to hit in the first from a fan base still angry about his slide that injured Scutaro 's hip . 	 Beltran is still left 0 - fer the World Series , winless in three Game 7s during his 15 - year career . And to think just last fall he was on the other side with the Giants as they missed the playoffs a year after winning the club 's first World Series since moving West in 1958 . 	 " If you look at the games we made a lot of mistakes and they did n't make any , " Beltran said . " They took advantage of those . They were able to put things together , offense , pitching , defense , and we could n't do that . " 	 The Cardinals went an NL - best 12 - 4 from Sept. 16 to the end of the season to earn the NL 's second wild card on the second - to - last day of the season , then won 6 - 3 in a winner - take - all playoff at Atlanta to reach the division series . The Cardinals then rallied from a 6 - 0 deficit with a four - run ninth inning to stun the Washington Nationals 9 - 7 in Game 5 . 	 Sandoval 's run - scoring groundout in the first that put his team ahead gave him at least one RBI in five straight postseason games , matching home run king Barry Bonds ' franchise record set in 2002 . 	 Now , Sandoval and the Giants get to play on . 	 " It 's just surreal . The victory lap right there was the greatest thing , " said Zito , left off the 2010 postseason roster for all three rounds but now a candidate to pitch Game 1 . " We play best when our backs are against the wall . " 	 The Giants snapped an 0 - 5 skid in deciding Game 7s . ... The Tigers and Giants will meet for the first time in the postseason . 	 Information from The Associated Press was used in this report . 	 Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year . 	 From MVP to Cy Young and more , this is your one - stop shop as baseball 's 2021 hardware is handed out .

SAN FRANCISCO -- A roly - poly Kung Fu Panda outslugged the Triple Crown winner . An October outcast outpitched the Cy Young ace . 	 With Pablo Sandoval and Barry Zito taking star turns , this World Series is off to a rollicking start . 	 Sandoval hit three home runs and joined Reggie Jackson , Babe Ruth and Albert Pujols as the only boppers to do it in the Series , and the San Francisco Giants jolted Justin Verlander and the Detroit Tigers 8 - 3 on Wednesday night in Game 1 . 	 " Man , I still ca n't believe it , " Sandoval said . 	 A boisterous AT&T Park crowd -- a sea of black and orange outfits -- roared as Sandoval connected in his first three at - bats . Popular in the Bay Area for his outgoing personality and unusual physique , he went 4 - for-4 and drove in four runs . A Giant panda for sure . 	 From the first pitch to last , it was basically a perfect game by the Giants . Coming off a Game 7 win over St. Louis on Monday night , they looked totally fresh . 	 " We played our last game only two days ago , " Sandoval said . " We 're still hot . We just came here and played our game . " 	 Verlander , the reigning Cy Young winner so dominant in this postseason , looked uncomfortable from the outset and constantly pawed at the mound . 	 As fans filed out singing along with Tony Bennett 's standard " I Left My Heart in San Francisco , " the final score raised a nagging question for manager Jim Leyland and his favored Tigers : Did too much rest after a playoff sweep of the Yankees mean too much rust ? 	 " I just did n't execute tonight , " Verlander said . " It was kind of a battle from the get - go . They took advantage of that and swung the bat pretty well , especially Pablo and ( Marco ) Scutaro . A couple of good bounces their way , bad for us . " 	 Game 2 is Thursday night , with Doug Fister starting for the Tigers against Madison Bumgarner . 	 Left off the 2010 World Series roster by the champion Giants , Zito shut out the Tigers until Triple Crown winner Miguel Cabrera 's RBI single in the sixth . The Giants won for the 14th straight time with Zito starting . 	 " Just the opportunity alone was mind - blowing . Me and my wife were dancing around when I heard , " Zito said of getting the Game 1 start . " And then the boys came out swinging and played great defense . " 	 Sandoval did his damage with his bat . He donated the wood he used for the first two homers to the Hall of Fame -- no need for it anymore , he broke it on the backswing of his second shot . 	 It was certainly a moment of retribution of Sandoval . He was benched during the 2010 World Series , his production and confidence down , his weight up . In the stands on this night , fans wearing furry panda hats celebrated with him . 	 " You have to keep working . I 've never lost faith to be here , " he said . 	 Get this : It was the first three - homer game at the stadium originally known as Pac Bell Park since the very first one , when Kevin Elster did it for the Dodgers in 2000 . Nope , not even home run king Barry Bonds had done this . 	 Tagged by Sandoval for a solo shot in the first inning , Verlander could only mouth " Wow ! " when the Giants star launched a two - run drive in the third that set off another blast of fog horns . Sandoval reprised his power show from this year 's All - Star Game , when his bases - loaded triple highlighted a five - run first inning against Verlander . 	 Quite a blast from a team that finished last in the majors in homers . 	 " We 're not known for our power , " manager Bruce Bochy noted . 	 And if there was any doubt that Verlander was shaky , the clearest sign came in the fourth . That 's when Zito , a career .099 hitter , sliced an RBI single with two outs off the current AL MVP for a 5 - 0 lead . 	 The festive crowd stood and applauded when it was announced that Verlander was being pulled for a pinch hitter in the fifth . Sandoval gave his followers another reason to get up moments later when he hit a solo homer off reliever Al Alburquerque in the fifth , answering the cheers by waving his batting helmet in a curtain call . 	 The Tigers seemed out of sorts in their first game following a five - day layoff . That was an issue in 2006 , too , when Verlander and his teammates had nearly a week off before getting wiped out by the Cardinals . 	 " I 'm one that 's been around long enough to know that a lot of things happen in this game . This was a big - hyped game with Justin , probably a lot of pressure on him , " Leyland said . 	 " But I do n't think it had anything to do with the pressure . His fastball command was not good . He got out of sync . He got on fast forward . He just did not pitch well tonight . It 's that simple , " he said . 	 Pujols homered three times last year , Jackson accomplished the feat in 1977 and Ruth did it in 1926 and again in 1928 . 	 For good measure , Sandoval lined a single his last time up . 	 " We were hoping for a water shot but he got a lousy single . Kind of killed the whole deal for us , " Giants reliever Jeremy Affeldt kidded . 	 Sandoval is one of a record nine Venezuelans on the Series rosters , and his power performance attracted attention way beyond the ballpark . 	 " There goes the third ! Pablo makes history , " Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez tweeted in Spanish . 	 Scutaro , the NL Championship Series MVP , twice hit RBI singles after doubles by Angel Pagan . NL batting champion Buster Posey contributed two hits , left fielder Gregor Blanco made diving catches to rob Cabrera and Prince Fielder , and Tim Lincecum came out of the bullpen to prevent further damage . 	 The Giants kept getting good bounces , with Pagan hitting a double that hopped off the third - base bag . ALCS MVP Delmon Young , meanwhile , failed to run after a tapper in front of the plate that the Giants turned into a double play . 	 Pitching in San Francisco for the first time since 2008 , Verlander scuffed at the rubber while warming up for the first inning , pulled off his glove after badly overthrowing a curve and kept taking deep breaths . He hardly resembled the guy who was 3 - 0 with an 0.74 ERA in three playoff starts this year . 	 Ever since two poor outings in the 2006 Series against St. Louis -- punctuated by two throwing errors -- Verlander has worked hard to harness his emotions and 100 mph heat in the early going . 	 Verlander was trying to settle in when Sandoval tagged him , pouncing on an 0 - 2 fastball and lining it into the front row over the center - field wall . 	 Verlander got into trouble again the third , and pitching coach Jeff Jones strolled to the mound when the count went to 2 - 0 on Sandoval . Verlander stared at Jones and shook his head . On the next pitch , Verlander could do little but watch the ball sail into the front row in left . 	 To some , this looked somewhat similar to the 2010 Series opener . That day , the Giants beat up the supposedly unhittable Cliff Lee on their way to a five - game romp over Texas . 	 " Well , you know , it 's hard to figure this game sometimes . You hear the old adage -- ' That 's baseball . ' These guys are human , and sometimes they 're not quite on top of their game , " Bochy said . 	 This is how bad it got for the Tigers : Former closer Jose Valverde made his first appearance in 11 days . Leyland still is n't sure what he 'll get from the struggling reliever . 	 Lincecum , meanwhile , retired seven straight batters and struck out five of them . The two - time Cy Young winner has embraced his new role in the bullpen . 	 Jhonny Peralta hit a two - run homer for the Tigers in the ninth off mop - up reliever George Kontos . 	 Tampa Bay 's Desmond Jennings was the only other player this year to homer twice in a game off Verlander . ... Willie Mays and fellow Giants Hall of Famers Willie McCovey , Orlando Cepeda and Gaylord Perry took part in the first - ball ceremony . ... Tigers great Al Kaline , now a team executive , watched Detroit take batting practice from behind the cage . ... The Game 1 winner has won eight of the past nine championships . ... Cabrera and Posey marked the first set of batting champs to face each other in the World Series since 1954 when it was Mays of the New York Giants and Bobby Avila of Cleveland . When Cabrera walked on a close full - count pitch , he playfully patted the Giants ' All - Star catcher on his way to first base . ... Tigers bullpen catcher Jeff Kunkel wandered the stands well before the teams took the field for warmups , snapping pictures of the stadium and field with his cell phone . ... The Giants franchise played its 106th Series game -- they have won 50 -- trailing only the Yankees ( 225 ) and Cardinals ( 112 ) . The Dodgers are fourth with 105 . 	 Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year . 	 From MVP to Cy Young and more , this is your one - stop shop as baseball 's 2021 hardware is handed out . 	 Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season , leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR . 	 Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India 's 2021 campaign . 	 Julio Lugo , who played for seven teams in a 12 - year major league career , has died . He was 45 . 	 Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers .

SAN FRANCISCO --   Long ball one night , a Giant dose of small ball the next . 	 Two wins in two games and suddenly San Francisco does n't need to dig itself out of a postseason hole for a change . 	 Madison Bumgarner shut down the Detroit Tigers for seven innings , then the Giants took advantage of a bunt that stayed fair to eke out the go - ahead run in a 2 - 0 win Thursday night for a 2 - 0 edge in the World Series . 	 Gregor Blanco 's single trickled to a stop inches fair on the infield dirt , setting up Brandon Crawford 's run - scoring double - play grounder in the seventh . Hunter Pence added a sacrifice fly in the eighth , and that was plenty for these masters of the October comeback . 	 " It definitely feels a whole lot better than having our backs against the wall , " Bumgarner said . " But you ca n't relax . We 've got to keep pushing . " 	 Game 3 will be Saturday night in Detroit , and for once , the Giants are n't playing from behind . They overcame a 2 - 0 deficit to beat Cincinnati in the best - of - five NL Division Series and escaped a 3 - 1 hole against St. Louis in the NL Championship Series . 	 A day after Pablo Sandoval homered three times , the favored Tigers wondered what other way they could lose . Prince Fielder was thrown out at the plate by a hair , and moments later pitcher Doug Fister was struck squarely in the head by Blanco 's line drive , a ball hit so hard that it caromed into shallow center field . 	 " They asked me the typical concussion questions , " Fister said . " I 'm not concerned . I have a minor bump . According to my dad , my whole life his saying has always been if I got hit in the head I 'd be OK . That 's how I take it . " 	 The 6 - foot-8 Fister managed to stay on the mound , and even excelled . Bumgarner more than matched him , however , allowing just two hits before the San Francisco bullpen closed it out before another pulsating crowd . 	 Santiago Casilla pitched a perfect eighth and Sergio Romo worked the ninth for a save in the combined two - hitter , leaving Triple Crown winner Miguel Cabrera and his team in a huge hole heading back to Comerica Park . Anibal Sanchez will start for the Tigers against Ryan Vogelsong in Detroit . 	 " That 's the way baseball is . When things are going well , things are bouncing your way , " Giants second baseman Marco Scutaro said . " If things are n't going well , you just keep battling and playing hard . No one is taking anything for granted . " 	 Even so , several dozen members of the Giants family came onto the field at AT&T Park well after the final out to pose for pictures , wanting to savor what they hope is the Giants ' last home game of the year . 	 Blanco , meanwhile , was able to celebrate a single that rolled 45 feet , if that . 	 " I was joking with ( coach ) Roberto Kelly when I got to first base , ' We practiced that today , ' " Blanco said . " That was a perfect bunt . I was n't really trying to do that . I think it was just meant to be and I 'm thankful that I did it . " 	 The Tigers looked rusty at the plate , maybe still lost following a five - day layoff after an ALCS sweep of the Yankees . Cabrera hopped up in frustration after Sandoval snared his line drive to third . 	 " Well , what are you going to do about it ? " Tigers manager Jim Leyland said . " We got two hits tonight . I 'm certainly not going to sit up here and rip my offense because last night I thought we had some pretty good swings . Cabrera hit a bullet tonight . " 	 Bumgarner had something to do with the Tigers ' troubles , too . 	 Bumped from the NLCS rotation after two poor postseason starts , he returned with a flourish . The left - hander struck out eight and looked as sharp as he did in the 2010 World Series when , as a 21 - year - old rookie , he stopped Texas in Game 4 on the way to a championship . 	 " Just able to make pitches , " Bumgarner said . " I had n't done a very good job of making pitches this postseason so far and this is a team that you 're not going to be able to afford to miss with . 	 " They hit some balls hard , but luckily we were in the right spot , " he said . 	 Along with his bunt , Blanco might have hit the hardest ball of the game -- the liner that nailed Fister in the second inning . The ball struck the right side of his head and deflected on the fly to shallow center field . 	 Fister showed no visible effect from the blow -- in fact , some in the crowd wondered whether the ball perhaps glanced off his glove because Fister stayed on his feet . Only when fans saw replays did groans echo around the ballpark . 	 Leyland , pitching coach Jeff Jones and a trainer went to the mound , and Fister insisted on staying in the game . He walked the next batter to load the bases with two outs , but retired Bumgarner on a popup , starting a streak of 12 straight hitters set down by Fister . 	 " Well , if you 'd have been out there , it was something to see , " Leyland said . " Because the trainer was saying , ' Where are you ? ' ' San Francisco . ' ' What game is it ? ' ' Game No . 2 . ' 	 " I do n't want to make light of it , but it was kind of comical really because Doug was right on with everything . But I was scared to death when it happened . " 	 The game remained scoreless until the seventh , right after actor Colin Hanks -- a former peanut vendor at the nearby Oakland Coliseum -- sang " Take Me Out to the Ball Game " on the field . 	 Pence led off with a single and Fister departed , getting lots of hugs in the dugout . Rookie reliever Drew Smyly walked Brandon Belt on a full - count pitch and Blanco 's bunt loaded the bases with no outs . 	 The Tigers kept their infield back up the middle , and had no play at the plate on Crawford 's bouncer . 	 " We felt like we played double - play depth because we felt like we could n't give them two runs . That 's why we did that , and we got the double play , " Leyland said . 	 " To be honest with you , we were absolutely thrilled to come out of that inning with one run . Absolutely thrilled . I mean , we had to score anyway . " 	 Pence added the insurance run the next inning with his fly ball off Octavio Dotel . 	 " We played good small ball today , " Pence said . " We played a great game of baseball , had outstanding pitching and great defense and we found a way to get it done . " 	 Of the 52 teams to take a 2 - 0 lead in the World Series , 41 have gone on to win the title . That includes 14 of the last 15 teams with that advantage . 	 " I 'm not sure , and I have n't done any studies on it , " Giants reliever Jeremy Affeldt said , " but statisically it 's always better to be 2 - 0 than 1 - 1 or 0 - 2 . I 'm just guessing . " 	 Fielder and the Tigers came up inches short of taking an early lead , the result of yet another alert play by Scutaro and a dubious decision by third - base coach Gene Lamont . 	 Fielder was hit by a pitch to lead off the second , Delmon Young followed with a double and when the ball rattled around in left field , Lamont waved the burly slugger home . Even with no outs , Lamont sent him . 	 " I think Gene just got a little overaggressive , " Leyland said . 	 Scutaro , in the middle of every big play for the Giants this month , dashed across the diamond , caught Blanco 's relay and unleashed a strong throw to the plate . All - Star catcher Buster Posey made a swipe tag to Fielder 's backside , just as the Tigers ' star slid home . Umpire Dan Iassogna had a clear look and made a demonstrative call -- out ! 	 Fielder immediately popped up from his slide and pleaded his case with two hands , saying he did n't feel the tag . Leyland rushed out and pointed to the plate . At second base , Young yelled , " No ! " 	 But even if there was replay review , it would n't have helped the Tigers . Because TV replays showed Iassogna , working his first plate job in a World Series , got it right . 	 " Any time those kind of freak plays happen that do n't go your way , " Fielder said . " It takes away a little momentum , but you 've got to be aggressive . They made a perfect play . " 	 There was no dispute that Fister somehow avoided a serious injury moments later . 	 Among those who winced was Oakland pitcher Brandon McCarthy , who sustained a skull fracture and brain contusion after being hit by a line drive last month . 	 " I 'm not watching but did just see the replay . Certainly hope he 's ok , " McCarthy tweeted . 	 Bumgarner struck out Austin Jackson and Omar Infante to start the game . Two other Giants fanned the first two batters in a Series game : Christy Mathewson ( 1905 ) and Carl Hubbell ( 1933 ) . ... Bumgarner picked off Infante at first base to end the fourth . Infante made a break for second and , like Fielder earlier , came up short with his slide . ... Scutaro was the only Giants hitter to have previously faced Fister . ... Posey has a hit in all seven World Series games in his career . 	 Detroit got a jump - start on the winter signings , landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez . We break down the deal . 	 In a free - agent field filled with future Hall of Famers , Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter . 	 Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox . 	 Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr. 's career .

DETROIT --   OK , so even Bruce Bochy has to grudgingly admit that his San Francisco Giants are on a World Series roll . 	 " I 'll say this : The club is playing well , " the manager said . 	 Well enough to become the first team to throw consecutive Series shutouts in nearly a half - century . 	 Well enough to blank Miguel Cabrera and the Detroit Tigers 2 - 0 on a chilly Saturday night for a commanding 3 - 0 lead . 	 Well enough to win their franchise - record sixth straight postseason game and never trail in any in any of them . 	 " I think confidence is the biggest thing , " newly found ace reliever Tim Lincecum said . 	 No team has ever blown such a huge margin in the World Series . And with the way Ryan Vogelsong , Lincecum and the Giants are pitching , it seemed unlikely the Tigers would even score a run , yet alone win a game . 	 Cabrera had the best chance to save the Tigers ' season , but the Triple Crown winner popped up with the bases loaded in the fifth inning . 	 Gregor Blanco hit an RBI triple and trotted home on Brandon Crawford 's single in the second inning , and that was ample for the Giants . Timely hits combined with another dominant effort on the mound and sharp defense put them close to their second title in three years . 	 After playing a nearly perfect Game 3 , the Giants will turn to Mr. Perfect Game himself -- ace Matt Cain -- to try for a sweep Sunday against Max Scherzer . 	 " We 've got Matt Cain tomorrow and he 's the guy to finish this , " Blanco said . 	 At this rate , it appeared only a bailout by the San Francisco staff could help the Motor City . 	 Do n't count on it . Switching to an AL park , chilly weather and a crowd of towel - waving fans ready to rock did n't slow 'em down at all . 	 " Well , it 's a good situation , but there 's nothing been done yet , " Bochy said . " It 's a number , just like I said about two . Now it 's three . But that 's not the Series . " 	 The Giants handed Detroit its first home loss in more than a month . The Tigers were coming off a sweep of the Yankees in the AL Championship Series in which they never trailed . 	 " We 're not forcing anything , we 're just not getting it done , " Tigers star Prince Fielder said . 	 " Obviously , you never visualize this kind of thing happening , " he said . 	 Vogelsong , a career journeyman whose path to the World Series took detours to Japan and Venezuela , improved to 3 - 0 with a 1.09 ERA in four starts this postseason . 	 " I knew my stuff was pretty good , " Vogelsong said . " I was really pumped up to be out there . " 	 Vogelsong induced two early double plays , then faced his stiffest test in the fifth . 	 The bases were loaded with one out when Vogelsong fanned rookie Quintin Berry . That brought up Cabrera , honored on the field before the game with an actual blue - and - gold crown for his Triple Crown accomplishments . 	 With the fans chanting " M - V - P ! " and likely sensing the whole Series was riding on this at - bat , Vogelsong seemed completely calm while chewing gum . He won the matchup , too , getting an easy popup that prompted Cabrera to slam his bat to the ground and elicited cheers in the San Francisco dugout . 	 " I was just trying to make a pitch , " Vogelsong said . " And the way we 're playing defense , really just trying to get him to put a ball in play somewhere because I had a good feeling we were going to catch it if he did . " 	 Lincecum took over with two outs in the sixth , and the two - time Cy Young Award winner looked as if he had been coming out of the bullpen his whole life and shut down the Tigers . 	 Closer Sergio Romo finished off the combined five - hitter with his second save of the Series . 	 Blanco punctuated the ninth inning with his latest fancy grab , a sprinting catch into foul territory in left field . 	 Combined with Madison Bumgarner 's effort in Game 2 , San Francisco threw the first consecutive shutouts in the Series since Baltimore in 1966 , when Jim Palmer , Wally Bunker and Dave McNally did the trick to finish off the Dodgers . 	 " We could n't get the killer hit or the killer blow , " Tigers manager Jim Leyland said . 	 Shut out only twice all year , the Tigers once again looked lost at the plate . When Fielder struck out in the eighth , the fan favorite caused boos to bounce around Comerica Park . Big sluggers with teeny numbers , Cabrera and Fielder are a combined 3 for 19 against the Giants . 	 " It is what it is , " Fielder said . 	 The fearsome Tigers have totaled a mere three runs and 15 hits while hitting .165 in three games , and were shut out twice in a row for the first time since April 2008 . 	 Only one team in baseball history has overcome a 3 - 0 deficit in the postseason , with Boston doing it in the 2004 ALCS against the Yankees . 	 " Well , you do n't really have to tell them anything . They can count , " Leyland said . " They 're big guys , they know what the situation is . " 	 For the Tigers , it was the sixth straight Series loss dating to 2006 against St. Louis . They got a fine effort from pitcher Anibal Sanchez this time , but it was n't enough against these Giants . 	 It was 47 degrees at gametime , a drop of 17 from Thursday night at AT&T Park , and the Tigers clearly knew this was their chance to pull back into the Series . 	 Soon enough , Game 3 took on a familiar look . 	 During the Giants ' early two - run burst , Detroit 's body language said all you needed to know about this Series . At one point in - between pitches , Cabrera put his hands on his hips at third base , shortstop Jhonny Peralta scuffed the dirt , second baseman Omar Infante turned his back to the infield , Fielder stared down at first . 	 A losing posture , plain and simple . 	 The Comerica crowd , so pumped earlier in the postseason , quickly fell silent . Desperate to cheer for anything , the fans hollered for a long , albeit routine , flyout by Delmon Young . 	 Detroit grounded into the most double plays in the majors this year , and two slick turns by Crawford at shortstop added to the Tigers ' total . 	 Both DPs came with two on and one out , by Fielder in the first and the speedy rookie Berry in the third . Berry put both hands on his batting helmet as he zoomed well past the base , running out his frustration . 	 Working on 12 days ' rest , Sanchez may have been the latest Detroit player to be caught in the Rust Belt , at least in the second inning . That 's when he constantly overthrew his fastball and did not resemble the pitcher who had made two sharp starts this postseason . 	 The San Francisco hitters also were amply familiar with Sanchez . This was the fourth time he had matched up with Vogelsong in the last two years -- Sanchez twice won duels , then lost a slugfest . 	 Hunter Pence , who scored one run and drove in the other during a 2 - 0 win in Game 2 , drew a four - pitch walk to begin the second . It was a telling sign -- Sanchez had not walked a right - handed batter since August . 	 Pence stole second , took third on a wild pitch and , with the Tigers ' infield playing in , trotted home when Blanco tripled off the wall in right . Crawford looped an RBI single with two outs for a 2 - 0 lead , and Rick Porcello began warming up in the Detroit bullpen . 	 Cabrera has safely reached base in all 23 postseason games in his career . ... A few fans outside the ballpark climbed part of the way up the exterior gate to catch a glimpse of the action from left field before a stadium attendant inside told them to get down . 	 Detroit got a jump - start on the winter signings , landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez . We break down the deal . 	 In a free - agent field filled with future Hall of Famers , Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter . 	 Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox . 	 Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr. 's career . 	 Former Boston Red Sox left - hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five - year deal worth $ 77 million , sources confirmed to ESPN . 	 From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right , this is your one - stop shop as baseball 's 2021 hardware is handed out .

DETROIT -- Smart pitching . Clutch hitting . Sharp fielding . Plus an MVP Panda . 	 All the right elements for a sweet World Series sweep for the San Francisco Giants . 	 Nearly knocked out in the playoffs time and time again , and finally pressed by the Detroit Tigers in Game 4 , Pablo Sandoval and the Giants clinched their second title in three seasons Sunday night . 	 Marco Scutaro -- who else ? -- delivered one more key hit this October , a go - ahead single with two outs in the 10th inning that lifted the Giants to a 4 - 3 win . 	 " Detroit probably did n't know what it was in for , " Giants general manager Brian Sabean said . " Our guys had a date with destiny . " 	 On a night of biting cold , stiff breezes and some rain , the Giants combined the most important elements of championship baseball . After three straight wins that looked relatively easy , they sealed this victory when Sergio Romo got Triple Crown winner Miguel Cabrera to look at strike three for the final out . 	 " Tonight was a battle , " Giants star Buster Posey said . " And I think tonight was a fitting way for us to end it because those guys played hard . They did n't stop , and it 's an unbelievable feeling . " 	 Posey , the only player who was in the starting lineup when San Francisco beat Texas in the   2010 clincher , and the underdog Giants celebrated in the center of the diamond at Comerica Park . 	 They built toward this party all month , winning six elimination games this postseason . In the clubhouse , they hoisted the trophy , passed it around and shouted the name of each player who held it . 	 " World Series champions ! " Giants outfielder Hunter Pence hollered . 	 A total team triumph . 	 " When pitching is your strength , you want a good defense , " manager Bruce Bochy said . " That   shows up every day . ... Hitting sometimes , it comes and goes . But as long as you can stay in more games , the better chance you have of winning them , and that 's how we play . " 	 Benched during the 2010 Series , Sandoval , nicknamed Kung Fu Panda , went 8 for 16 , including a three - homer performance in Game 1 . 	 " You learn , " Sandoval said . " You learn from everything that happened in your career . ... We 're working hard to enjoy this moment right now . " 	 Cabrera delivered the first big hit for Detroit , interrupting San Francisco 's run of dominant pitching with a two - run homer that blew over the right - field wall in the third . 	 Posey put the Giants ahead 3 - 2 with a two - run homer in the sixth and Delmon Young hit a tying home run in the bottom half . 	 It then became a matchup of bullpens , and the Giants prevailed . 	 Ryan Theriot led off the 10th with a single against Phil Coke , moved up on Brandon Crawford 's sacrifice and scored on a shallow single by Scutaro , the MVP of the NL Championship Series . Center fielder Austin Jackson made a throw home , to no avail . 	 " That 's what makes it so much special , the way we did it , " Scutaro said . " We 're always against the wall and my team , it just came through first series , second series and now we sweep the Tigers . " 	 Romo struck out the side in the bottom of the 10th for his third save of the Series . 	 The Giants finished the month with seven straight wins and their seventh Series championship . They handed the Tigers their seventh straight World Series loss dating to 2006 . 	 " Obviously , there was no doubt about it . They swept us , " Tigers manager Jim Leyland said . " So there was certainly no bad breaks , no fluke . 	 " Simple , they did better than we did , " he said . " It was freaky . I would have never guessed we would have swept the Yankees and I would have never guessed the Giants would have swept us . " 	 The Giants combined for a 1.42 ERA , outscored the Tigers 16 - 6 and held them to a .159 batting average . 	 " I think we never found our confidence at home plate , " Cabrera said . " It was not the same game we played . We could not find our game in the World Series . " 	 Bristled slumping Tigers slugger Prince Fielder : " This is not about me . This is about the team . " 	 An NL team won the title for the third straight season , a run that had n't occurred in 30 years . Some find the streak surprising , considering the AL 's recent dominance in interleague play . Yet as every fan knows , the club that pitches best in the postseason usually prevails . 	 Until the end , the Tigers thought one big hit could shift the momentum . It was an all - too - familiar October lament -- Texas felt the same way when the Giants throttled it in 2010 , and the Tigers knew the feeling when St. Louis wiped them out in 2006 . 	 " For one , we did n't allow doubt to ever creep in , " Pence said . " You know , the thing that made this team so special is just playing as a team , caring for each other . We had our backs against the wall and we knew it was n't going to be easy . It 's not supposed to be . " 	 Howling winds made it feel much colder than the 44 degrees at gametime . Two wrappers blew across home plate after leadoff man Angel Pagan struck out , and fly balls played tricks in the breeze . 	 The Giants started with their pregame ritual . They clustered around Pence in the dugout , quickly turning into a bobbing , whooping , pulsing pack , showering themselves with sunflower seeds . A big league good - luck charm , Little League style . 	 " That was one of our mottos , and we went out there to enjoy every minute of it and it was hard earned . Just an incredible , incredible group of guys that fought for each other , " Pence said . 	 Once again , San Francisco took an early lead . Pence hit a one - hop drive over the center - field fence for a double and Brandon Belt tripled on the next pitch for a 1 - 0 lead in the second . 	 The next inning , Cabrera gave the Tigers a reason to think this might be their night . 	 With two outs and a runner on first , Cabrera lofted an opposite - field fly to right -- off the bat , it looked like a routine out shy of the warning track . But with winds gusting over 25 mph , the ball kept carrying , Pence kept drifting toward the wall and the crowd kept getting louder . 	 Just like that , it was gone . 	 Cabrera 's homer gave Detroit its first lead of the Series , ended its 20 - inning scoreless streak and reaffirmed a pregame observation by Tigers Hall of Famer Al Kaline . 	 " The wind usually blows to right at this time of year , " Kaline said . 	 In the fourth , Max Scherzer and catcher Gerald Laird teamed on a strike 'em out - throw 'em out double play . 	 Trailing for the first time since Game 4 of the NLCS , Posey and the Giants put a dent in Detroit 's optimism . Scutaro led off the sixth with a single and clapped all the way around the bases when Posey sent a shot that sailed just inside the left - field foul pole for a 3 - 2 lead . 	 Detroit was n't about to go quietly , however . Young , the ALCS MVP against the Yankees , made it 3 - all with another opposite - field homer to right , this one a no - doubt drive . 	 Fielder finished 1 for 14 ( .071 ) against the Giants without an RBI . Minus key hits , the Tigers remained without a title since 1984 . 	 All 24 teams to take a 3 - 0 lead in the World Series have won it all . In fact , none of those matchups even reached a Game 6 . This was the first sweep for an NL team since Cincinnati in 1990 . 	 Working on nine days ' rest and trying to extend the Tigers ' season , Scherzer kept them close into the seventh . Often recognized for his eyes -- one is light blue , the other is brown -- he 's also known as a solid postseason pitcher . 	 Ditto - plus for Matt Cain , who was working on a nearly perfect year . 	 The Giants ' ace threw a perfect game in June , was the winning pitcher in the All - Star Game in July , beat Cincinnati to clinch the division series and topped St. Louis in Game 7 of the NL Championship Series . 	 After they left , the relievers decided it . 	 Octavio Dotel shouted , " Yeah ! Let 's go ! " toward his dugout after striking out Posey to end the eighth . In the bottom half , winning pitcher Jeremy Affeldt got around a leadoff walk when he struck out Cabrera , a flinching Fielder and Young . 	 Coke returned the favor in the top of the ninth , fanning the side . With Jose Valverde having lost his closer role during a shaky month , Coke stayed in for the 10th and faltered . 	 The Giants became the first champion that hit the fewest home runs in the majors since St. Louis in 1982 . Sandoval 's three drives in Game 1 started San Francisco 's romp , and its dominant pitching took over from there . 	 The parade to a sweep masked the problems San Francisco overcame to get this far . 	 Closer Brian Wilson pitched only two innings before an elbow injury ended his year . All - Star game MVP Melky Cabrera was suspended 50 games for a positive testosterone test , and not welcomed back when the ban ended . Two - time Cy Young winner Tim Lincecum struggled and wound up in the bullpen . 	 Swept in a three - game set at Arizona to start the season , the Giants were floundering under .500 in mid - May. They soon hit their stride and , boosted by trade deadline deals for Scutaro and Pence , passed the Dodgers in the NL West for good in late August and posted 94 wins . 	 Getting past Cincinnati and St. Louis in the playoffs presented challenges . Down 2 - 0 in the best - of - five division series , they rallied for three straight victories in Cincinnati . Trailing the defending champion Cardinals 3 - 1 in the NLCS , they again took three in a row to advance , clinching in a driving rainstorm . 	 Six elimination games , six wins . Facing the Tigers , San Francisco proved it could play with a lead , too . 	 The Giants became the first NL team since the Big Red Machine in the mid-1970s to win two titles in a three - year span . Shut out for 56 years -- Juan Marichal , Willie McCovey and Barry Bonds never won it all -- their self - described " misfits " captured that elusive crown in 2010 . 	 The Tigers ' flop finished off a season in which Cabrera became baseball 's first Triple Crown winner since 1967 . Detroit overtook the White Sox in the final week to win the AL Central and wound up 88 - 74 , the AL 's seventh - best record .
